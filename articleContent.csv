1,Self-Loathing GOP Congressman Can't Believe He's Been Reduced To Defending Necessity Of Public Schools,"WASHINGTON'As the nation falls deeper into the grip of a pandemic that has forced compromises upon his most cherished principles, a self-loathing Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN) acknowledged Friday he could not believe he had been reduced to defending the necessity of public schools in a civil society. 'I hear these words coming out of my mouth, these requests for more federal dollars so public schools can reopen, and I wonder, 'My God, what have I become?'' said Alexander, who wondered aloud whether he might still be able to console himself by diverting money from lunch programs and using it to build more charter schools. 'I can barely recognize myself anymore, this man who goes on television and talks about how a return to normalcy in American life depends upon increasing funds to public schools and ensuring they have everything they need to succeed. Ugh, how has it come to this? Has the half century I've spent in politics been a complete waste?' At press time, Alexander had reportedly cheered himself up by thinking about all the public school teachers and staff whose health would be threatened by reopening too soon."

'I just wanted to call and personally reprimand you for your victory,' said Pelosi, extending her sincerest indignation to the former Bronx middle school educator, who is expected to easily win the general election in his heavily Democratic congressional district. 'I understand there are some mail-in ballots that still need to be counted, but it appears you won big last night and energized a lot of first-time voters and young people we absolutely did not want voting in this primary. So allow me to extend my sincerest fuck-you for everything you've done. Obviously, we're going to be working together soon, so I look forward to crushing you the first chance I get.' Pelosi added that when things became official in November, she would call again to express how frustrated she was to welcome Bowman to Congress."

'We have seen people around this nation calling for dramatic change, and I can assure you that we intend to meet this moment with the support it deserves'a nice memorial, say, or perhaps a national day of remembrance that individual states can decide to declare an official day off work if they want,' said Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), echoing a bipartisan group of representatives that if these solutions were not acceptable to leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement, Congress was also willing to consider painting a mural. 'Whether it's one fairly prominent statue of a black person and white person holding hands in D.C. or several smaller ones in cities nationwide, we in Congress are committed to acknowledging the validity and importance of the Black Lives Matter movement. We will make sure that your voices are heard in small script on the bottom of federal calendars or in a bronze statue in some D.C. park.'

'We have been informed of the phrase 'systemic racism,' and, beyond that, we plan to use it in several sentences,' said Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in an impromptu press conference that also included House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and DNC Chair Tom Perez, who all echoed the fact that they have seen these two words next to each other on a sheet of paper given to them by aides, have read that sheet of paper, and will proceed to repeat those words both in conversation amongst themselves and with reporters. 'We understand that it is a phrase, and we will include this phrase in sentences we speak. In fact, you might see us on television using this set of words very soon. All of this is to say that today, we have discovered two new words that we are supposed to use. That's all.'

Yells Panicked Pelosi Aide Into Phone","WASHINGTON'Following reports that Donald Trump sprayed tear gas at protestors and members of the clergy before a photo-op at St. John's Church, a panicked aide to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi reportedly picked up the phone Tuesday and yelled 'she needs a Bible now, fuckwad'yes, it's for an epic clapback.' 'Look, I don't care how you get it, but get it now, because the clapback queen needed a photo of her in a pink pantsuit, reading a bible on Twitter, Facebook, and the front page of CNN five fucking minutes ago,' said the hoarse, screaming aide, who then added that if she didn't see a holy text within the next 10 minutes, 'your ass will never work in Washington, D.C. again.' 'Listen, you little bitch, I don't care if it's the middle of a global pandemic, and I don't give a shit if every bookstore is closed'this is the voice of a generation, so you will rob a fucking church if you have to, do you understand? This is going to be a fucking epic-Trump-takedown-iconic-girlpower-slam. Now hurry the fuck up. Before I end you.'

'We're confident that once our party is freed from the burden of putting forth nominees and running expensive campaigns, we'll finally be able to focus all our efforts on generating as much revenue as possible,' wrote DNC chairman Tom Perez, adding that he hoped an upcoming series of fundraisers to which the letter's recipients were invited would help pay for even bigger fundraisers down the line. 'So just go online, make your donation, and we'll take it from there. Whether you're able to give $5 a month or cut us a check for the annual maximum of $35,500, we promise to take that money and put it toward making even more money. We're confident that with no candidates or platforms to disagree on, Democrats of every stripe will unite to give us the financial support we've always wanted. Together, we can do this.'

The Onion looks at the pros and cons of voting by mail. Furiously research ballot measures at last minute from comfort of your own home Delicious adhesive on envelope Creates nice, tidy piles of mail-in ballots to be conveniently lost somewhere No need to rent tux Potential several-day delay before being let down by outcome Walk to mailbox a real drag Eliminates only plausible excuse for loitering at middle school Candidates still fucking awful Unclear if USPS can handle huge responsibility right in middle of getting dismantled Risks easily facilitating nation's participation in democracy"

10,Biden Campaign Considering Using The Internet To Attract Voters,"PHILADELPHIA'Saying it was definitely something they were looking into, officials with Joe Biden's presidential campaign confirmed to reporters Wednesday they were actively exploring the possibility of using the internet to attract voters. 'We may use it, we may not, but yes, it is one of the outreach tools on our radar at this time,' said Biden 2020 co-chair Cedric Richmond, adding that the campaign 'didn't want to get ahead of itself,' but if surveys showed there was a sizable block of registered voters using the technology, it might eventually hire two or three staffers to work on the internet full-time. 'It's pretty cutting-edge stuff. The web can send text and images right to people's computer screens, so it may actually turn out to be an effective means of spreading the vice president's message. And who knows, there might even be a way to raise money through the internet. We'll be conducting more research into the matter as soon as we install the free trial disk we have in our files.' At press time, the Biden campaign had reportedly published a single standard-definition photo of the presumptive Democratic nominee on a Blogger account set to private."
11,Nancy Pelosi Assures Democratic Reps They Don't Need To Try Being Productive During Stressful Pandemic,"WASHINGTON'Encouraging lawmakers to avoid holding themselves to the impossible standard of protecting Americans, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) assured Democratic House representatives Wednesday they don't need to try being productive during the stressful pandemic. 'These uncertain times are difficult for everyone, so don't feel like you need to push yourself to constantly come up with detailed plans to avert a new depression,' said Pelosi, insisting that House Democrats should tune out the nagging voice of constituents pressuring them to ease mass suffering by enacting essential social safety measures before it's too late. 'Don't create a bunch of tension in your life by attempting to secure aid to unemployed Americans struggling to pay for basic necessities. Supporting workers is not going to happen anyway, so don't get all stressed. Look, this is not the time to beat yourself up over whether you're doing enough to prevent a cataclysmic economic decline. Take a breather. Sometimes it's better to just plop down on the couch and watch movies all day.' At press time, Pelosi emphasized there would be plenty of time to work on enacting legislation after the pandemic was finished cratering every aspect of American life."

'Well, you see Prime Minister, because of your severe respiratory issues, we, um, actually needed to access that part of your head for a...surgery thing, yes,' said senior clinician Dr. Randal Jensen, taking long, awkward pauses as he looked between his medical charts and Johnson's new head of short, well-coiffed hair. 'Simply put, if we had kept your hairstyle the way it was, you could have risked death or something else, probably. We believe this is because the uh...keratin in your hair is related to your lungs, but don't worry too much about that right now. We actually do it to all our patients. Right, yes, we definitely do that.' At press time, the prime minister had reportedly informed his medical team that after his emergency lifesaving haircut, he'd never felt better. "

16,Senator Kelly Loeffler Asks For Prayers After Losing $3 On Single Stock Due To Coronavirus,"WASHINGTON'Begging her constituents to keep her family in their thoughts in the coming days, Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) asked for Americans to send her prayers in an emotional press conference Tuesday in which she announced that she had lost as much as $3 on a single stock due to the coronavirus. 'I am asking for all of your support in helping me through this difficult time, a time of incalculable financial loss that I hope none of you have to experience,' said the junior Georgia senator, often straining to hold back tears as she told reporters that she and her husband would be spending the coming weeks speaking with financial advisors about how to make sense of this unimaginable fiscal hardship. 'You tell yourself something like this can never happen to you, you pretend you're immune to the terrible effects of this pandemic, but then you check in with your investment advisor and the news is almost too much to bear. Three dollars. Gone forever. When Jeffery and I found out, we cried for hours. I'll never forget the memory of my beloved stock's market value. May God protect the rest of our portfolios during this challenging time.' At press time, Loeffler had started a GoFundMe to recoup the loss and raised over $90,000 in the first few minutes."
17,Georgia Governor Argues That Closing State's Beaches An Attack On Citizens' Fundamental Right To Get Wet 'N' Wild,"ATLANTA'With public health experts decrying his decision last week to reopen the state's beaches, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp argued Monday that any government action limiting fun in the sun would constitute an infringement upon every citizen's fundamental right to get wet 'n' wild. 'Our forefathers fought and died to ensure future generations of Americans could enjoy certain God-given freedoms, among them the ability to head on down to the beach anytime one likes and have a splish-splashin' good time in the waves,' said Kemp, adding that he had no doubt the American colonists' decision to secede from Great Britain stemmed in part from concerns over whether the crown would continue to guarantee them unfettered access to sunshine, sand, and surf all summer long. 'If we cannot throw on a pair of trunks, wax down our boards, and shred those waves; if we cannot slip on some shades and work on our tans; if girls in bikinis cannot play a simple game of beach volleyball in the sizzlin' hot sun, then who are we, as a people? My God, 'from sea to shining sea''it's right there in the Declaration of Independence.' Kemp went on to state that Georgia's owners of beachfront property were exempt from his order and welcome to continue trammeling upon people's right to enjoy the ocean."
18,Trump Admits 18 New States To Increase Competition For Medical Supplies,"WASHINGTON'In an effort to attract better offers from governors forced into bidding wars over life-saving equipment, President Donald Trump admitted 18 new states Monday to increase competition for medical supplies. 'The free market works best with some healthy competition, so by increasing the number of U.S. states to 68, we can hopefully double the cost of ventilators,' said Trump, who noted that American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Midway Atoll, Toronto, and Tijuana were among the 18 territories that had been fast-tracked into the Union. 'It's important our manufacturers are getting the best prices possible. We're sending 300,000 surgical masks to a new state in the middle of Maine we're calling Clovis. Nobody lives there, but it's going to help drive up demand. The Coral Princess cruise ship is also now a state, a beautiful floating place, and they're looking for PPE, too. We don't have enough for them, but we're looking forward to their bids.' At press time, Trump clarified Puerto Rico would remain an unincorporated territory. "
19,Southern Governors Argue Covid-19 Good Christian Virus That Wouldn't Dare Spread During Church,"TALLAHASSEE, FL'In a bold affirmation of faith during a time of widespread global pandemic, the governors of several Southern states confirmed Thursday they have exempted religious services from their shelter-in-place orders, arguing that Covid-19 is a good Christian virus that wouldn't dare to spread during church. 'As far as I can tell, this coronavirus is an upstanding and righteous disease that knows better than to continue its deadly outbreak within a house of God,' Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said in a statement later echoed by Govs. Bill Lee of Tennessee, Greg Abbott of Texas, and Tate Reeves of Mississippi. 'If we were talking about some sort of secular, atheistic virus, churchgoers might have cause for worry. But I believe in my heart this highly communicable pathogen will show respect during services and not do anything to harm the Lord's flock on our day of rest. Now, what the virus does to the wicked, sinful people in our community'that's between it and God.' At press time, sources confirmed Southern governors had taken steps to ensure all mosques would be closed indefinitely."
20,Jared Kushner Says States Should Have Planned Ahead Before Joining The Union,"WASHINGTON'Speaking at a press conference to address the growing Covid-19 pandemic, White House senior advisor Jared Kushner admonished resource-stricken states this week that they should have shown some foresight and planned ahead before joining the Union. 'To any governors coming to me and saying the White House hasn't given them what they need, I would urge them to ask why they didn't consider these possibilities centuries ago when they first joined together into a federal republic?' said Kushner, singling out Texas' governor in particular and questioning why the Lone Star state didn't simply start stockpiling their own ventilators or face masks back in 1884 when they allowed the United States to annex them from Mexico.''Some of you, like Massachusetts or Virginia, have actually had several hundred years with the knowledge that our Constitution grants significant independence in resource allocation to individual states. Frankly, you could have decided way back in 1776 that this setup wasn't for you. Instead, you impulsively formed a unified nation without even considering the consequences. I'm sorry if I don't sympathize here.' Kushner stressed that he was tired of hearing excuses from states that didn't begin building a respirator cache in the 18th century because they were busy with westward expansion or that modern germ theory simply had not yet been developed."

22,Trump Tackles Medical Supply Shortage By Awarding ExxonMobil Contract To Drill For Ventilators In Arctic,"WASHINGTON'Saying there was no way the coronavirus could win with such amazing corporations on their side, President Donald Trump kicked off his plan to tackle the medical supply shortage Tuesday by awarding ExxonMobil an exclusive contract to drill for ventilators in the arctic. 'Today, the heroic crews at ExxonMobil will travel to Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, where they will drill 6,000 feet below the earth in search of new, undiscovered mechanical breathing devices,' said Trump, signing the $86 billion deal that gave the oil company sole access to survey, drill, and extract from over 30,000 square miles of 'vast, untapped reservoirs of respiratory ventilators.' 'While this crisis is a challenge, I want to assure the American people that there are millions of medical devices lying just below the arctic surface, and all we need is ExxonMobil's vast network of drilling rigs to find them. That's why we're also announcing the construction of a long-distance ventilator pipeline, as well as an exclusive, multi-billion-dollar contract with Shell to begin extracting ventilators on Native American reservations throughout South Dakota.' At press time, President Trump had reportedly once again downplayed the need for medical supplies after one of ExxonMobil's largest offshore tankers exploded. "
23,Trump Delays Easter To July 15 To Keep Promise On Coronavirus,
24,Trump Announces Plan To Retrain Nation's 3 Million Unemployed Americans As Human Ventilators,"WASHINGTON'Taking drastic action to address the country's critical medical supply shortages as well as rising jobless claims, President Donald Trump announced a plan Friday to retrain the nation's 3 million unemployed Americans to work as human ventilators. 'We're going to put Americans back to work by teaching them to lock lips with infected coronavirus patients and pump air into and out of their lungs,' said Trump, who explained how the Department of Labor would be giving all out-of-work Americans an opportunity to take an accelerated training course to learn how to successfully provide ventilatory assistance to Covid-19 patients with their mouths. 'States asked for help, and we've listened. This is going to save hundreds, potentially thousands of lives, and put our nation's great service workers back on their feet. There are thousands of very, very sick people waiting across the country with their mouths gaping open.' At press time, Trump told reporters that if unemployment numbers continue to rise, that many of the jobless could take on roles as hospital beds."
25,What's In Congress' Coronavirus Stimulus Bill,"After days of frenzied negotiations, Congress passed a $2 trillion stimulus package to address economic issues caused by the coronavirus, the largest such aid package in U.S. history. The Onion takes a look at what's in the stimulus bill. Direct payments of $1,200 for single Americans, $2,400 for married couples, and $3,000 for those playing the field. $32 billion to an airline industry that charged you for a blanket on your last flight. Paywall taken off U.S. Unemployment Office website. More protections than you'd think necessary to safeguard American people from their president. Lot of money the government has spent decades telling Americans it didn't have and couldn't spend. Probably something that sounds very good and turns out to be very bad. Five dollars to Senator Ron Johnson for winning betting pool that Rand Paul would get virus first. Every family will receive $500 per child, but officials may not come to collect the children until May. Federal aid for independent contractors, such as Uber drivers and assassins. A stern reminder that this is a one-time thing."
26,"Congress Sets Aside $1,200 In Trust For Each American Until They Prove They're Responsible Enough To Handle It","WASHINGTON'Following days of partisan gridlock over its emergency economic stimulus plan, Congress announced sweeping new legislation Wednesday that would place $1,200 into trust funds for each individual American until they have proved they're actually responsible enough to handle it. 'We've given this a lot of thought and decided that instead of mailing out checks, we will put this money into 330 million separate accounts that you'll be able to access when you're a little bit older and can show you've developed some real maturity,' Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) said as he sought to assure the nation that one day the U.S. populace would thank both houses of Congress for choosing to handle its historic $2 trillion relief plan in this way. 'Now, don't look so glum. We know you want to have it now, but it took us quite a bit of negotiating to get this money together, and we want to make sure you aren't just going to run out and blow it all on a bunch of stuff you don't need. So, keep your nose out of trouble, and one day this fund will be there waiting for you when you want it for something really important.' At press time, Grassley explained how multinational corporation Boeing could receive money from the federal government anytime it wanted because it had already won over lawmakers by generously spending so much money since its last bailout on donations to congressional campaigns."

28,Trump Suggests Ceding New York To Coronavirus As Possible Appeasement Strategy,"WASHINGTON'Mulling solutions to stop the disease's rapid spread across the country, President Donald Trump reportedly suggested Tuesday ceding New York to the coronavirus as a possible appeasement strategy. 'We are committed to looking at all options as we work through the invasion of this virus on our shores, including ceding at least the city of New York and potentially the entire state in order to meet the virus halfway and spare the rest of America from further suffering,' said Trump at a press conference, adding that his understanding of what the coronavirus wanted led him to believe that New York's 54,000 square miles and nearly 20 million residents would be sufficient to placate the respiratory disease. 'We're not in a good situation right now, but I think we can find a solution that will make me happy, make the American people happy, and make the virus happy. This is a win-win and everyone gets what they want. This is a big, big change, but in the end we're going to like the final result. I think this is a sacrifice everyone is willing to make. The virus should know that we respect where it's coming from and how dangerous it is, which is why we're offering a very big state. This is a very smart virus and it will know a good deal. I'd take this deal if I were the virus. Some of my advisors suggested Rhode Island or New Hampshire, but I know that won't be enough. We're hoping the coronavirus will be reasonable. We're hoping that if we give the coronavirus New York that will be enough and it will go back to China or Italy or wherever it came from. Maybe we'll throw in New Jersey as well.' New York governor Andrew Cuomo said he was willing to work with Trump but that ceding the entire state to the coronavirus was too much, and asked if he could reduce the offering to just the state's prisons and migrant detention centers."
29,Trump Urges Loosening CDC Restrictions To Let Coronavirus Get To Work,"WASHINGTON'Calling for an end to precautions such as social distancing and shelter-in-place mandates, President Donald Trump urged the loosening of CDC restrictions Tuesday to let Covid-19 get to work. 'The economy is hurting'we must send the coronavirus back into our office buildings, schools, and factories,' said Trump, explaining that the nation cannot risk the possibility of the number of new cases and deaths crashing. 'We need those numbers up! This is America, and work is important here. Without work, the virus has no purpose. Right now, there are millions of virus particles just sitting around and doing nothing. The coronavirus wants to work, so we're going to put it back to work as soon as possible.' At press time, the Dow had skyrocketed as the coronavirus returned in full strength back into the American workforce."
30,GOP Urges End Of Quarantine For Lifeless Bipedal Automatons That Make Economy Go,"WASHINGTON'In an effort to contain the disastrous financial fallout resulting from the spread of Covid-19, economic advisor Larry Kudlow joined numerous GOP leaders Monday in urging an end of self-quarantine for the lifeless bipedal automatons that make the economy go. 'We can't allow this virus to completely upend American life, so we are recommending that these soulless humanoid contraptions return to powering the country as soon as possible,' said Kudlow, noting that the upright, unthinking facsimiles needed to return to their primary function of lifting GDP and improving the stock market. 'We believe this group of insentient golems to be relatively low-risk due to their lack of a respiratory system, and right now, they're just gathering dust being stuck in their storage containers. Of course, we continue to recommend extreme caution and social distancing for any actual humans who may come into contact with these unthinking, unfeeling entities.' Ludlow added that to be extra cautious, any automatons who felt unwell should power down for the next two to three weeks."
31,Richard Burr Wondering When Profiting Off Mass Suffering Suddenly Became A Crime In This Country,"WASHINGTON'Admitting he was blindsided by the hysterical reaction to a pretty normal transaction, North Carolina Senator Richard Burr wondered Friday when profiting off mass suffering had suddenly become a crime in this country. 'Jesus Christ, when did everyone get so uptight about this? I remember when we used to celebrate people who used their talent and connections to get rich from death and anguish,' said Burr, who claimed what he did was no different than what many successful, patriotic Americans have been doing for hundreds of years. 'Even Tucker Carlson is being a little bitch about this. What's the big deal? Didn't we all decide this was cool in the 2008 recession? Last time I checked, using sensitive information to enrich yourself at the expense of hundreds of millions of other people was totally fine. I talked to Kelly [Loeffler] and Ron [Johnson] about cashing out, and nobody even batted an eye. What's the point of being a senator if you can't profit off the world's problems? I'm making money, not losing it, but I guess jealous people have decided that becoming rich and powerful from a national tragedy is suddenly evil. There's something seriously wrong with this country.' At press time, Burr announced his intentions to resign after shamefully admitting he only pulled in a 22% return from his insider trading."
32,Trump Administration Releases Best Case Scenario Projections For Coronavirus Where 8 Million Iranian People Die,"WASHINGTON'Striking an optimistic note in his daily press briefing about the global pandemic, President Donald Trump spoke to reporters Thursday, detailing his administration's best case scenario projections for coronavirus where eight million Iranian people are killed. 'If we're very lucky, we could be looking at many millions of dead Iranians, which is why we must do everything in our power to act,' said Trump, confirming that the U.S. government would be pouring resources into continued sanctions and military action against Iran to boost those numbers. 'We're taking this very seriously and monitoring the situation at all times, and we're hopeful that we could hit this target, or maybe even go past it, but the reality is, this is just a projection and it could tragically be as low as three or four million. We need help from every sector to make sure these citizens are unable to receive medical assistance and continue dying in the street.' When pressed by reporters, Trump acknowledged that the time had come to confront the ugly reality that at least some Iranians would survive."
33,Trump Seeks To Stimulate Economy By Sending Rare Autographed Photo To Every American,"WASHINGTON'With markets plummeting and many workers losing jobs as the coronavirus pandemic wreaks havoc on businesses, President Donald Trump announced Thursday a plan to stimulate the economy by sending a rare autographed 8-by-10-inch glossy photograph of himself to every U.S. resident. 'We know people are hurting financially, so in order to assist them at this critical time, I will be sending out these exclusive and very high-quality signed Donald J. Trump headshots to every American,' said the president, explaining that the approximately 330 million recipients of the exclusive collector's items could sell them for a hefty sum and then use the cash to cover rent, groceries, and medical bills, which would, in turn, pump billions of dollars back into the economy. 'Look, I'm a pretty well-known guy, so these things should definitely fetch a nice price and be a huge help to our workers, sustaining them through a difficult moment in our country's history. All we ask is that you do choose to sell them and spend the money now, for the sake of the economy, rather than holding on to these beautiful, limited-edition keepsakes as they inevitably appreciate in value. This is truly the stimulus we've all been waiting for.' At press time, critics had assailed Trump for exploiting a loophole in the new plan that allows him to send large corporations hundreds of thousands of extra autographed photos of himself."
34,Triumphant Jared Kushner Announces Plan To Move CDC Headquarters To Jerusalem,"WASHINGTON'Celebrating his own ingenuity in the face of the Covid-19 outbreak, President Donald Trump's senior advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner triumphantly announced his new plan Thursday to move the Centers for Disease Control headquarters to Jerusalem. 'The dire situation with the coronavirus demands bold solutions, and the time is now to move the CDC headquarters thousands of miles across the Atlantic,' said Kushner, gesturing to a map of the West Bank and indicating that a Palestinian neighborhood would need to be paved over to begin construction on the state-of-the-art facility. 'While all operations will be delayed for a few months so we can get started, once everything is up and running, we'll be able to address this pandemic from one of the world's most historically significant cities. We're taking the world's best doctors, scientists, epidemiologists, and immunologists to an entirely different continent to solve this global crisis. Finally, we'll be able to streamline collaboration between the CDC and the U.S. Israeli Embassy.' At press time, Kushner announced further plans to build strip clubs on Jerusalem's holy sites for CDC employees who may be homesick for Atlanta."
35,"Trump Quietly Checks With Aides To Make Sure He'd Be Included In Receiving $1,000 Government Checks","WASHINGTON'As his administration makes plans to combat the economic damage caused by the coronavirus with direct payments to Americans, President Donald Trump reportedly conferred with aides behind closed doors Wednesday to confirm he would be among those citizens receiving a pair of $1,000 checks. 'Hey, I'm also getting in on this deal, right?' Trump reportedly said to a White House economic strategist he had pulled aside, asking him to double-check the list of recipients and make sure he was on there, since he was 'an American too, after all,' and it was 'only fair' he receive the same assistance as everyone else. 'How soon are these things coming? Can we expedite them? An extra couple grand would be nice right about now. I should get my check first because I'm president and I've been working hard. Everyone else should get theirs after me. Maybe we could have a televised ceremony where I receive the check. That would boost morale, especially if I got a little more money than everybody else. Also, my kids are going to get them too, right? Is there any way those ones could just be forwarded directly to me?' At press time, sources reported that Trump increased the proposed amount of money Americans would be receiving to $2,687 after learning that taxes would have to be taken out."
36,Conservative Worries Relief Checks Would Discourage Americans From Providing For Selves By Killing Him And Taking His Property,"NEW HAVEN, CT'Speaking out against proposals to provide federal assistance to Americans hardest hit by the pandemic-fueled economic downturn, local conservative Mark Garrett expressed worry Wednesday that relief checks would discourage citizens from learning to provide for themselves by killing him and taking his property. 'People in this country should have enough self-reliance to stand on their own two feet, bust down my door, cut my throat, and seize all of my possessions,' said Garrett, adding that in America, there are plenty of profits to be had by anyone motivated enough to just go out there and forcibly take them. 'There's a real moral hazard here: When you pay people for doing nothing, it rewards them for being too irresponsible to look at all the wealth I've accumulated and realize that if they simply kidnapped my family and held them for ransom, I would eagerly pay it. A resourceful person wouldn't even need a gun, not if they were enterprising enough to come at me with a knife, an ax, or a tire iron. At the end of the day, if you're not willing to murder me while I'm asleep in bed and pocket all my valuables, you're not willing to work.' Garrett went on to ask why federal funds couldn't instead be given to the national guard, which would need to be sent in to impose martial law when the peasants began to riot."
37,Congress Allocates $2 Trillion To Bail Out Struggling Bailout Industry,"WASHINGTON'In order to alleviate the heavy damage the crucial financial sector is facing in the midst of the ongoing Covid-19 outbreak, the United States Congress announced Tuesday that they would be allocating $2 trillion in order to bail out the struggling bailout industry. 'The bailout industry is on the brink of failure, so in order to prevent a full-on catastrophe, we are setting aside $2 trillion in order to bail it out,' said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), adding that the business of giving of massive sums of money to corporations so they can cover their losses is at the very bedrock of the U.S. economic system, and without assistance, the entire bailout industry as we know it could collapse, which could lead to another Great Depression. 'During a crisis like this, the bailout industry is often hit the hardest, so we are taking immediate action, as our economy is deeply dependent on the bailout system; if bailouts can't function, then America can't function. A cash injection is absolutely necessary to make sure these failing businesses can inject cash into failing businesses.' At press time, Congress had signed a bill to allocate funds to bail out their bailout of the bailout industry."
38,Biden Pledges To Select Woman As Vice President Since Position Doesn't Entail Much Anyway,"WASHINGTON'In a bid to secure support for his nomination as the Democratic Party's candidate for president, Joe Biden reportedly pledged Sunday to select a woman as vice president since the position doesn't entail much anyway. 'I promise that my vice president will be a woman, since pretty much anyone can do this job, so I figure, hey, might as well pick a lady,' said Biden, adding that he knew from experience in his eight years as U.S. vice president that the position was essentially ceremonial and required no real work, so he had no reservations about handing it to a woman. 'You basically just sit on your can all day and maybe show up at a meeting every month or two, so if a woman wants to do that, be my guest. I could see myself selecting [Senator] Amy Klobuchar, [former Georgia State Rep.] Stacey Abrams, or any one of the tens of millions of women perfectly capable of pulling off this no-show gig. I don't really care what her politics are, and anyway it hardly matters. This works out well, actually, since I can stick a lady in the VP spot and don't have to put one in an important role on the cabinet.' At press time, Biden was being praised by members of the media and his own party for his commitment to symbolic representation in an office that most people forget about half the time."

'I don't get why I'm being slammed by all these cable news commentators and opinion columnists who, if they were put in charge of a pandemic by a powerful family member, would smugly assume they knew exactly what to do too,' said the senior adviser to the president, who explained he was especially hurt to see so many of his fellow Harvard University alumni denouncing one of their own. 'You guys are acting all holier-than-thou, but if your father-in-law were president of the United States instead of a board member at some media conglomerate, you'd choose to work in the West Wing, too. Just fucking admit it.' Kushner added that this went for 'all the little hypocrites' at Fox News too, who he claimed were also judging him, even if they were afraid to say it out loud."

'I just got off the phone with 911, they are aware of the situation, and we'll soon have this thing taken care of,' the commander-in-chief said during a televised address on Covid-19, urging all 330 million Americans not to worry because emergency response personnel should be arriving to assist them any minute now. 'I made sure to tell the operator this thing was important, and she agreed with me. So everyone should just relax and wait for them. They can send the fire department and the ambulance or both, and then they can probably give you a flu shot or something like that. It's good. We're in good shape.' At press time, White House sources confirmed the president had dialed 911 again to tell them that everything was actually fine and the nation didn't need their help at all."

44,Biden Extends Olive Branch To Biden Supporters,"PHILADELPHIA'In a largely measured speech calling for party unity after a string of primary victories, former Vice President Joe Biden took to the stage Tuesday night to extend an olive branch to Biden supporters. 'I appreciate the enthusiasm and energy of Joe Biden's voters, and I want any of his supporters who feel lost or counted out to know that there is a place for them with my campaign,' said Biden, stressing that while he and the vice president did not see eye to eye on every issue, they both shared values that represented a bold new vision for the American people. 'Of course, I might have occasionally clashed with Joe Biden in the more strained moments of recent debates, but we also worked together for many years in the Senate. At the end of the day, whether you're a Biden supporter or a Biden supporter, we have the same goal, which is to get Trump out of the White House and replace him with Joe Biden.' At press time, pundits launched into fevered speculations that the candidate's speech could contain hints Joe Biden was mulling the choice to appoint Joe Biden as vice president."
45,Tulsi Gabbard Named Democratic Nominee After Discovery Of Obscure Rule That Grants Nomination To Whoever Wins 0.7% Of The Vote In Missouri,"WASHINGTON'Beating out her rivals with the help of a little-known technicality, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) was named the Democratic Party's nominee for president Wednesday after the discovery of an obscure rule that grants the nomination to whoever wins 0.7% of the vote in Missouri. 'We weren't expecting this, but after double-checking the party's rules, it appears we are obliged to select Tulsi Gabbard as our candidate in 2020,' said Democratic National Committee chair Tom Perez, shrugging his shoulders and pointing to a section of a crumbling, yellowed document that contains the esoteric bylaw. 'I know a lot of Democrats were probably wondering why she was still in the race. But last night, while cross-referencing an old rule book in preparation for the upcoming debate, we came across this forgotten section of our charter, and, well, it all checks out. I admit it was a pretty cunning strategy on her part. With 100% of precincts now reporting, it appears the congresswoman received exactly 0.7% of votes in the Missouri primary yesterday. And so the time has come for us to put aside our differences and unite behind the next president of the United States, Tulsi Gabbard.' Perez went on to apologize on behalf of his entire party for not awarding the Democratic nomination for president to Sen. Furnifold McLendel Simmons (D-NC) in 1920."

'Let's see, there's one for Bernie, one for Biden, one for Klobuchar, one for Buttigieg'and I'd better not forget Warren or Bloomberg or Deval Patrick or Tulsi, 'cause they're blue, too,' said McMaster, who frantically colored in the circle beside the first name on his form after noticing the candidate was a Democrat, and then did the same for the other 21 Democrats listed. 'I've never heard of Robby Wells or Rocky de la Fuente III, but if they're Democrats, they're getting a vote. Almost got 'em all! Wait, hold on'I don't see John Delaney or Kirsten Gillibrand on here. Am I supposed to write them in?' At press time, sources confirmed that McMaster had left all the down-ballot races blank."
47,Biden Gives Speech From South African Jail Cell Where He Still Imprisoned For Supporting Nelson Mandela,"JOHANNESBURG'Striding across the cement floor of his sparse confines, Joe Biden gave a speech Monday from the South African jail cell where he is still imprisoned for supporting Nelson Mandela. 'I have sacrificed a great deal'my freedom, my livelihood, and my safety'in my fight against apartheid, but it has all been worth it to help my great friend Nelson Mandela,' said the former Vice President, his gaunt frame pacing the 8-foot-by-7-foot cell that he has called home since he was arrested for visiting the revolutionary South African civil rights leader in the 1970s. 'Despite the fact that I have been unjustly incarcerated here in Africa for decades, I am dedicated to becoming the 46th president of the United States. The fact that I have already been able to serve as your VP and as a senator before that is a testament to what I can accomplish. No walls can contain my mind, and I promise that once I am released, we're going to the DNC and then on to the White House.' At press time, Biden assured reporters that even if Nelson Mandela does not become his running mate, he does expect an endorsement from the anti-apartheid hero to be forthcoming."
48,Key Priorities For Trump's Reelection Campaign,"President Donald Trump will receive the Republican Party's nomination for president, and his reelection campaign against his eventual Democratic challenger is already well underway. The Onion takes a look at the key priorities for Trump going into his reelection campaign. Remind voters of achievements from first 10 years in office. Renew broadly popular campaign tactics like humiliating Ted Cruz and his family. Just the right amount of God. Expand electoral map beyond GOP's usual voter-suppression strongholds. Appeal to immigrant communities by saying he was just kidding. Massive campaign of graft, nepotism, and conflicts of interest has worked so far. Check if anyone's compiled credible evidence of corruption to use against Joe Biden. Maintain steady flow of marginally related words during speeches. Tout ability to work across aisle with Democrats on raising defense budgets, hurting American workers, and confirming Supreme Court justices. Try not to take whole thing too seriously and just have fun with it."
49,Biden Defends Past Inappropriate Touching Of Women As Symptom Of Stuttering Hands,"DETROIT'Opening up about the lifelong struggle that has been a source of embarrassment and frustration, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden defended Thursday his record of inappropriately touching women as a symptom of his lifelong struggle with stuttering hands. 'Since my childhood, I've been burdened with this debilitating problem'anytime I wrap my hands around a woman's waist or give them a shoulder rub, it's because of a nervous medical tick,' said Biden, choking up while recounting how much his uncontrollable caressing of women's backs and touching of their faces have hurt him over the years. 'I was often too ashamed in the past to speak about it, but I know there's some teenager out there grabbing a classmate's ass who needs to know they are not alone. I've dealt with the misfortune of seeing my hands reach out and pull a woman uncomfortably close to me and the embarrassment of them mocking me and saying 'Stop doing that.' I've worked to get it under control, and I want my supporters to be confident that I will only occasionally be touching women over the course of the presidential campaign.' At press time, Biden was attributing his support of the Iraq war and opposition to school busing as the result of a challenging brain stutter."

'She's completely shameless'every time there's a hot new guy in his late 60s or early 70s, she's all over him,' law clerk Angela Young told reporters, adding that when Ginsburg was first introduced to Supreme Court intern David Kearney, she had smiled coyly at the gray-haired man and said in a husky voice, 'You can just call me Ruth, sweetheart.' 'The other day, I saw her sit on his desk and invite him to stop by her chambers sometime if he ever needs someone to show him the ropes. It's the same thing every term. She just can't help herself when there's a 67-year-old piece of ass around.' At press time, Ginsburg had reportedly stopped Kearney as he was leaving for the day and asked if he wouldn't mind staying late to help her with her briefs."

'When touring across America, I saw no city that had been more mistreated and dismissed by its local officials than South Bend. I promise you, I will work tirelessly to overturn the mistakes of the previous administration. We'll be destroying the river walk and the smart sewer system and ending the Commuters Trust'all wastes of taxpayer money. You deserve a mayor who doesn't abandon you to fly to other states that he has no chance of winning, or take time away from focusing on your welfare to criticize the intelligence of dedicated, experienced senators. Congratulations, South Bend, your eight-year nightmare is finally over.' At press time, Klobuchar's administration had convicted 80% of the city's black population."
52,Biden Wondering Where All This Support Was When He Still Had Functioning Brain,"WILMINGTON, DE'As the moderate wing of the Democratic Party consolidated its backing around his candidacy, former Vice President Joe Biden reportedly wondered Thursday where all this support was back when he still had a functioning brain. 'Here's the deal: I'm flattered that everyone's voting for me and the big Democratic donors are giving me a lot of money, but look, I used to have a general idea of what was happening, and it would've been nice if they'd shown me that kind of support back then,' said the former vice president, trailing off and staring blankly for a moment before telling reporters that he didn't win a single state when he ran for the party's nomination in either 1988 or 2008, when he would have been physically and cognitively prepared for the demands of running in a general election. 'I've been pandering to people and compromising progressive goals for decades, and now you're just throwing all this campaign support and money behind me? I was lucid for 70 years! I honestly can't figure you people out. Why are you just now saying Joe Biden should be president when I can't hold a train of thought for longer than 10 seconds or talk to anyone on the campaign trail without getting agitated and sticking my finger in their face? What is your deal?' Sources confirmed that Biden also wondered why the Democrats were supporting him now that he wouldn't be the only candidate in clear mental decline with a history of reactionary policies in the race."
53,Sanders Supporter Urges Importance Of Listening To Minority Voices Just Not Specifically The Ones Who Handed Victory To Biden,"DETROIT'Stressing the need for inclusivity and intersectionality in the 2020 Democratic primaries, local Bernie Sanders supporter Kevin Randall took to Facebook Wednesday to stress the importance of listening to minority voices, just not any of the ones that have handed victory to Joe Biden. 'We need to make clear that, with the exception of those who showed up in droves to vote for Biden in South Carolina and on Super Tuesday, our movement has room for all people of color,' wrote Randall, who explained that it's important to avoid becoming siloed within one's own narrow worldview and to empathize with Americans from every background who did not just make Biden the new frontrunner last night. 'Marginalized groups are being shut out of these conversations, so we need to take a moment to hear what, in particular, 18-to-35-year-old, college-educated, progressive black and Latino voters from western states have to say. They, along with the tiny minority of working-class citizens in disenfranchised minority communities who object to the moderate platform of Joe Biden, should not be made to feel invisible in our democracy.' Randall later added that it was also important to listen to older Jewish people, except for the ones who cast ballots for Mike Bloomberg."

55,Frustrated Bloomberg Staffer Literally Just Aborted Fetus For This Job,"NEW YORK'Expressing her displeasure about the unfortunate timing of her boss dropping out of the presidential primary, Bloomberg staffer Eliza Wilkonson was reportedly frustrated Wednesday that she had literally just aborted a fetus for this job. 'God damn it, I wish Mike could have given me a little heads up,' said Wilkonson, confirming her annoyance at having received the news about the former New York mayor suspending his campaign mere minutes after she returned to her office from the abortion clinic. 'He'd been dropping hints for weeks about how hard it would be for me to give this job my all if I was distracted with a child, so it would have been nice if he had thought to contact me about his plans before I went to all this trouble. It sucks too because I had been really looking forward to having this kid.' Wilkonson added that she felt especially aggravated knowing that she wouldn't be able to vent about her situation due to the non-disclosure agreements she'd been forced to sign."
56,Biden Says Incredible Comeback Proves He Can Beat Progressive Democrat In A General Election,"LOS ANGELES'Touting his Super Tuesday victories as evidence that he would stand strong in the face of any real change, Joe Biden announced Wednesday that his incredible electoral comeback proves he can beat a progressive Democrat in the general election. 'Democratic voters have spoken, they know that when it comes to the presidential election, I would be by far the most likely candidate to defeat Bernie Sanders,' said Biden, who cited his strength among a wide variety of demographic groups as proof he was the unity figure the party needs to fight back against the Democratic Socialists they would be facing in November. 'People know this election is the most important of our lifetime, and we need to nominate someone who can stop progressive policies in their tracks. In fact, if we harness that energy, I have no doubt we can deliver a resounding defeat to the entire Democratic party.' Biden ended his victory speech by claiming that if this momentum continued, the Democrats could be celebrating their biggest victory over their opponents ever at July's convention."
57,Last-Minute Change To Super Tuesday Primary Rules Requires All 14 States To Vote At Same Polling Place,"CLARKSVILLE, AR'In an effort to reduce confusion and improve transparency, Democratic National Committee officials confirmed that last-minute changes to the Super Tuesday primary rules would require all 14 states to vote at the same polling place. 'We want to consolidate the process and cut down on red tape, so Democratic voters casting ballots in any of today's 14 primary races need to report to Pyron Elementary in Clarksville, AR before polls close at 7:30 p.m.,' said DNC chair Tom Perez, adding that voters from Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, and Virginia should check in at the table inside the auditorium, accessible from the school's north entrance, while those from American Samoa would be caucusing in the gym. 'Clarksville is centrally located in the middle of the country, which we hope most people will find convenient. We expect the line to stretch a good 20-30 miles long, but once you reach the voting booth, you'll be in and out'bang'in about 10 minutes. We encourage everyone to be patient, and I recommend bringing enough food and water to last several days. A folding chair probably wouldn't be a bad idea, either.' At press time, volunteers manning the Clarksville location confirmed that only two of the five voting machines were currently working."
58,Biden Confident After Spending Super Tuesday Stumping Across Iowa,"DES MOINES, IA'Expressing optimism about how the upcoming electoral contest would play out, presidential candidate Joe Biden was reportedly feeling confident about his chances this week after spending Super Tuesday stumping across Iowa. 'I've spent the last 24 hours crisscrossing the state to get people excited about the Biden campaign, and tonight all that hard work pays off,' said the former vice president, recalling the dozens of stops he'd made in towns like Dubuque and Mason City to hold rallies in school gyms and rec centers to urge Iowans to vote. 'I'm feeling really good about our chances here, especially since it seems like a lot of my rivals have completely given up on the state. You'd be amazed how shocked Hawkeyes are when they see me stopping into their local diner, and I think we're going to be able to translate that excitement into big numbers at the polls.' Biden added that he was hopeful his momentum from Iowa would propel him to a knock-out victory in New Hampshire."

'To run for president and sell these unworkable ideas of unity when I have no plans for actually achieving them is unfair to the American people,' said Buttigieg, who attacked his campaign as inflexible and alienating to anyone who did not agree with his narrow worldview of what the Democratic party should be. 'For me to step on stage and sell myself as president of the United States is just absurd. This election is too important for Americans to take a risk on this fantasy of a small city mayor who could magically transform politics. The disingenuous, ego-driven promises, soaring rhetoric, and lack of results are why people have grown sick of Washington, and why I should drop out of the presidential race.' At press time, Buttigieg had declined to endorse another candidate, noting that suggesting Democrats had any chance of winning in November would just be another empty promise."
61,Damning New Footage Shows Sanders In 1980s Arguing Madonna Could Never Make Transition From Music To Film,"NEW YORK'In a video from late 1984 that was circulating online Friday and could severely damage his bid for the presidency, Bernie Sanders can be heard openly questioning whether Madonna was likely to succeed in the transition from making records to acting in major motion pictures. 'Look, she's an undeniable pop sensation with a promising string of top-20 hits to her credit, but let me tell you something: There's no guarantee that kind of talent is going to translate to the silver screen,' Sanders, then mayor of Burlington, VT, says in a local public-access broadcast in which he clearly exhibits short-sightedness in his failure to anticipate the undeniable success the Material Girl would achieve in box-office smashes such as A League Of Their Own and Evita. 'Madonna should stick to music. People love this Like A Virgin album, it's a lot of fun to dance to, and she needs to build on its success. Taking time away from that to focus on what are sure to be small, insubstantial roles in lackluster films? That's career suicide.' Reminded by reporters that Madonna had won acclaim for her role in Desperately Seeking Susan just a few months after his videotaped remarks, a visibly angry Sanders argued that Rosanna Arquette had carried that entire film and anyone who said otherwise didn't know 'a goddamn thing' about acting."

'I'm running a legitimate campaign for the highest fucking office in the nation, carrying on the legacy of brave historical women who stood up to oppression and spoke truth to power, I'm not an excuse for you to create a lame-ass 'TeamWarren'-branded Etsy account,' said the Massachusetts senator sternly, adding that she was an 'actual human woman with legislative experience, not an adult Hermione motherfucking Granger.' 'Oh, you stitched 'Nevertheless she persisted' onto another damn pillow for your Instagram? Cute. By the way, have you ever heard of canvassing, or is the 'pussy hat' you wasted crucial primary outreach hours crocheting too snug around your ears? And, while we're on this, where are the profits from that deluge of enamel pins going? Certainly not to my campaign, last I checked.' At press time, Warren had punched through the glass of a framed poster featuring her head photoshopped onto Wonder Woman's body that her 'so-called supporters' had mailed to her campaign headquarters."

'Look, I don't want to toot my own horn here, but I'm a two-term president with significant pull among Democratic voters and I can't help but feel a little bummed that no campaign has even raised the question of whether I'd consider endorsing them,' said the 44th commander in chief, stressing that he would happily express his full-throated approval for Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders or any of the race's other candidates if they had even so much as broached the topic with him during recent in-person conversations, email chains, and phone calls. 'Especially Joe. I mean, I worked with the guy for eight years, and he hasn't even reached out to test the waters. I'm not trying to overstate my significance, but it's not crazy to think my vouching for what he did as vice president could really change the way this race shakes out, right? I mean, what the hell? I feel like a forgotten man over here.' At press time, the former president had sighed and started drafting an enthusiastic endorsement of Tulsi Gabbard after receiving a request from one of the representative's assistants."

69,Candidates Struggle To Answer Question About Future Of Granite Countertops During HGTV Town Hall,"CHARLESTON, SC'Clearly uncomfortable being asked to express their views on such a contentious issue, the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates struggled Wednesday to answer questions about the future of granite countertops during a series of HGTV town halls. 'As president, what are you going to do to address the fact that wages are stagnating to the point where the vast majority of Americans can't afford the granite countertops and backsplash tiles they desperately need to fix up their homes?' asked Jonathan Scott, who was moderating the HGTV town hall with his Property Brothers co-host Drew Scott, interrupting candidate Pete Buttigieg's stammering response to note that a majority of voters doubted the former South Bend, IN mayor could effectively unify angry members of the nation's polarized homeowners associations behind a common lawn care policy. 'How do you plan to address the millions of Americans making do with laminate countertops, or who are forced to live in homes where there's a lack of natural sunlight in the kitchen? Will you commit today to providing the support for all Americans to knock down a wall and open up the floor plan of their common areas? Many people out there are wondering whether their future will include a brick patio or detached deck, or whether they'll ever even be able to live in a place that is perfect for entertaining. How do you respond?' At press time, Senator Amy Klobuchar was being booed by the HGTV town hall audience after she doubled down on controversial previous statements criticizing crown molding. "

71,Sanders Supporter Sick Of Movement Being Defined By Small Number Of Toxic Members Like Him,"DENVER, CO'Stressing that his angry rants and unhinged perceptions of the world in no way represented the Vermont senator's broad coalition of supporters, 27-year-old Adam Patterson told reporters Wednesday that he was sick and tired of the Sanders movement being defined by a small number of toxic members like himself. 'Honestly, I'm just fed up with the mainstream media taking a tiny sample of aggressive and borderline unhinged Bernie supporters like me and suggesting that we somehow represent the millions of completely normal Bernie voters out there,' said Patterson, stressing that the condescending way that he insisted anyone who slightly critiqued Sanders or his plans was a neoliberal shill, white supremacist, or supporter of war criminals did not at all reflect Sanders' largely issues-oriented campaign. 'Look, clearly I'm a lunatic who has lost all touch with reality or historical context. I mean, I've repeatedly argued I'd rather live in Venezuela under Nicolas Maduro than the totalitarian state of America. That's crazy. And, frankly, I'm sure if Bernie saw me going online and telling women they were fucking corporatist bitches for supporting Warren, he would condemn it, because it distracts from his generally positive message. But I'm just one person. Should the media get to cast all Bernie supporters in a negative light just because of a few complete and utter assholes like me?' At press time, Patterson had decided that the best solution to the mischaracterization was to tell a female journalist who wrote about Bernie Sanders' history of praising left-wing dictatorships to get ovarian cancer and die."
72,Trump Holds Diplomatic Ceremony To Formally Welcome Coronavirus To United States,"WASHINGTON'Declaring that he was looking forward to showing the influential global entity around the country, President Donald Trump held a diplomatic ceremony Wednesday to formally welcome the coronavirus to the United States. 'This is a historic day for America, and I hope that the coronavirus will appreciate our efforts to give it a warm reception and work with us to build a thriving, mutually beneficial relationship,' said the president, announcing that Covid-19 would join him on the White House South Lawn for the presentation of an American flag accompanied by a military brass band, before a meeting with high-ranking administration officials and leaders from the business community in the Oval Office. 'We have a full itinerary planned over the next few days in which will tour a variety of Washington cultural sites, newly built manufacturing facilities, and even the state-of-the-art Johns Hopkins Hospital, so the coronavirus can observe firsthand the best of American pride and ingenuity. We are excited to develop a stronger bond with such an influential force in the international community, and we hope that a strong partnership with the coronavirus could lead to further diplomatic relations with H1N1, SARS, and other prominent global viruses.' At press time, a Trump administration spokesperson announced a change to the diplomatic itinerary after the coronavirus had expressed an interest in touring the CDC director's lungs."

'Our first question is for Mayor Bloomberg: How will you respond to another two hours of the other nominees just completely wrecking your shit?' said CBS This Morning co-host Gayle King, citing the fact that the billionaire former New York City mayor had spent the debate six days earlier 'getting absolutely bodied' and wondered whether he had a plan to prevent 'a complete and total roasting' from happening again. 'Mr. Bloomberg, do you believe that you prepared this time, and is it going to be enough? Because from where we're sitting, you got ripped a new one last debate, and now you're about to be hit from every side. Honestly, after seeing how easy it was last time, we wouldn't be surprised if the other candidates are even better prepared to tear you apart. Tonight, the whole country is watching to see if you have any plan to avoid getting fucking hammered again. You ready?' Sources confirmed that fellow CBS moderator Norah O'Donnell then interjected and told Bloomberg that they would give him 30 seconds to run off the stage if he still wanted to save himself before it started."
75,Klobuchar Hoping To Distinguish Herself During Debate As Only Candidate Not Sucker Punched In Gut Moments Before Stepping On Stage,"CHARLESTON, SC'Stressing that the contrast between herself and her rivals could not be starker, presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar told viewers at Tuesday night's Democratic debate that she remained the only candidate who had not been sucker punched in the gut moments before stepping on stage. 'Tonight, I'm asking voters to really think about the distinct choice they're being offered between a heartland Democrat with a record of serious accomplishments and six other candidates who have spent this entire debate doubled over and collapsing in front of their podiums or wheezing for air,' said the Minnesota senator, pointing to her distinguished record of not getting absolutely clocked in the moments before a national television appearance before gesturing across the stage at a whimpering Bernie Sanders clutching his stomach as he rolled around in agony. 'Ask yourself, if Elizabeth Warren wasn't prepared to get slugged right in the breadbasket as she stepped into the spotlight, then do you really think she'll be ready for the presidency? Now you've seen what my fists are capable of this evening, and if you're ready for a different type of candidate'one who isn't whimpering and begging for mercy'then I promise you a place with me.' At press time, Klobuchar had torn into Michael Bloomberg's supposedly tough-on-crime record as the dry heaving former New York City mayor began to retch onto the debate floor."
76,Elena Kagan Worried She's A Fraud After Being Only Female Justice Not Called Out By Trump,"WASHINGTON'Expressing doubt over whether she deserved of all her accolades, Supreme Court Associate Justice Elena Kagan was reportedly worried Tuesday that she was a fraud after being the only female justice not called out by President Donald Trump for being biased against him. 'Has my career meant nothing? I feel so invisible,' said Kagan, gazing at her reflection in a mirror and questioning what it was her fellow female justices have that she herself lacks. 'I mean, I was solicitor general as well as dean of Harvard Law School and I thought that was impressive, but does that even really mean anything if the president isn't calling on me to recuse myself from cases involving him? This man should hate me, yet he hasn't said a word about me voting against his wealth test for immigrants, or any of my other rulings. Am I just a big phony?' At press time, Kagan was trying to comfort herself by considering that a mistaken Trump might think she was actually a Bush appointee."

'Although we may come from different worlds, and our civilizations are separated by millions of lightyears, the bonds we share are still incredibly powerful,' said Trump, who marveled aloud at the strange vegetation and peculiar culture of the foreign planet, remarking to aides that the inhabitants of India were 'a lot like us,' despite their extraterrestrial origin. 'When I landed here in my flying craft after a long journey at warp speed through multiple galaxies, your entire planet came out into the streets to welcome me as if I were a member of your own species. That's something I'll never forget. May our two countries continue to exist in interplanetary harmony, sending a message of peace to the rest of the universe.' Trump later complimented Indian prime minister Narendra Modi's efforts to combat the intergalactic Muslim threat that puts their shared star system in danger."
79,Embarrassed Heart Surgeon Admits He May Have Accidentally Left Sanders' Medical Records In Candidate's Chest,"LAS VEGAS'Acknowledging the blunder following public pressure that his patient release the confidential documents, embarrassed heart surgeon Dr. Michael Sharrer admitted to reporters Monday that he may have accidentally left Bernie Sanders' medical records in the candidate's chest. 'Honestly, I just set them down for a second, and before I knew it he was all closed up,' said Sharrer, who speculated that he must have misplaced the Vermont senator's health records inside Sanders' thoracic cavity while performing the stent procedure with the scalpel in one hand and the files in the other back in October. 'It was a manila folder filled with all kinds of test results and charts. It probably got tucked behind the rib cage. I really should have been more careful considering that was our only copy. We could try an X-ray, but they might be difficult to read because they're probably all bloody. Man, we should really switch to digital records.' At press time, Sanders' critics were calling upon the presidential candidate to cut open his chest to release the records."
80,"Trump Administration Rolls Back Hunting Regulations Forbidding Use Of Chokeholds, Eye Gouging On Birds","WASHINGTON'In a legal measure that will greatly expand the options available to American sportsmen, the Trump administration announced Thursday that it would repeal legacy regulations forbidding the use of controversial chokeholds and eye-gouging when hunting game birds. 'Although animal rights activists have long decried placing grouse in sleeper holds, piledriving pheasants, and headbutting doves, we recognize that these inarguably effective moves have a long tradition among wingshooters,' said President Donald Trump in a press conference, adding that no less a man than Theodore Roosevelt had thought nothing of roundhouse kicking a brace of ducks for his dinner. 'They call the move the 'Crossface Chicken Wing' for a reason. Furthermore, banning the use of the common folding chair as an implement for slamming birds across the head is a holdover from the days of ignorant environmentalists who don't respect traditional hunting. True woodsmen know that respecting nature often means wrapping barbed wire around your fist to pummel a Canada goose or digging your thumbs into the eyes of a woodcock, and that there isn't a hunter alive who wouldn't curb stomp a wild turkey.' President Trump then posed for photographs while repeatedly smashing a quail beak-first into one of the White House's marble columns."
81,Experts Concerned Pale Russian Mystic Constantly At Trump's Side May Attempt To Influence 2020 Election,"WASHINGTON'Increasingly troubled about the role the self-proclaimed visionary and healer might play in the presidential race, intelligence experts expressed concerns Friday that Volokov Molchalin, the pale Russian mystic constantly at President Donald Trump's side, may attempt to influence the 2020 election. 'While we're unsure exactly what Volokov is whispering into Trump's ear'or if it's a known language at all'it's the consensus of the intelligence community that he likely intends to meddle in the upcoming election, perhaps by using his self-professed hypnotic powers to sway the American public,' said National Intelligence Director Joseph Maguire, noting that the long-bearded Eastern Orthodox prophet had enjoyed unprecedented access to the Oval Office since laying his hands on the president's thigh in early June and allegedly curing him of an internal hemorrhage. 'What's more unsettling is that Volokov has only grown more brazen in his attempts to alter the president's behavior, encouraging Trump to purify himself by self-flagellating, filling the West Wing with frankincense, or repeating occult incantations until his eyes roll back in a mystical trance. We've also received reports that Volokov can read minds, which would obviously make any counterintelligence efforts difficult, if not impossible.' At press time, terrified officials had escalated their warnings after a failed assassination attempt in which repeated stabbings, a gunshot wound to the head, and an apparent drowning in the freezing Potomac River failed to end the Russian mystic's life."

'I'm supposed to be polishing the silver today, but instead I have to wear a stupid white wig and let Mr. Bloomberg attack the feasibility of my Medicare-for-all plan,' said maid Flora Bishop, who feared the 15-person housekeeping staff would be unable to complete their daily cleaning tasks as their boss forced them to restart the debate yet again after fumbling a question about prison reform. 'We basically just stand around and let him tear our policies apart until he feels like he's won. Usually, I'll just say something about how all my ideas are bad compared to his so I can get back to the laundry. I feel terrible for the landscaper who played Buttigieg last time. Mr. Bloomberg fired him after he made a really good point about trying to buy the election.' At press time, the housekeepers were frantically motioning for the chauffeur, who was acting as moderator, to stop pressing their boss on stop-and-frisk policing tactics."

'Look, folks, we are at an important crossroads in our bid for the nomination, and I'm asking you from the bottom of my heart to please, please stop giving to my campaign so I can just end it already,' Biden wrote in an email sent to every individual, corporation, and political action committee that has contributed to his campaign, adding that with their generous help, they could help put him out of his misery at this 'crucial juncture' right before the Nevada caucus. 'I'm going to be honest with you. We're being outpaced in fundraising by the other campaigns, and that is great, because I am very, very tired and ready to admit defeat; so please, whether you have $1 or $100 to spare, don't send either. I know I can count on you to support me as I head back into retirement and try to pretend none of this ever happened.' At press time, sources confirmed Biden began openly weeping when he received a $4 million surge in donations."

'Chantix has made some especially aggressive ad purchases in recent months that helped spread the word about Ray Liotta and his struggle to find a stop-smoking aid that works for him,' said polling expert Kevin Michaels, stressing that the extensive television ad campaign familiarized Americans with Liotta as a 'father, actor, and ex-smoker' and directly led to the polling surge that secured his place on the debate stage. 'What these ads have done for key sections of the electorate is not only boost awareness of Liotta, but also expose voters to his difficulties to quit cold turkey before eventually finding a way to overcome his urge to smoke with Chantix. It's a message of hope that's clearly resonating with voters.' At press time, experts suggested the strategy may have backfired after Amy Klobuchar hammered Liotta for pushing a product that can cause changes in behavior, depressed mood, and nausea."

'You peons, you mean as little to me as a clump of dirt to a mighty mountain, and I'll step on the necks of every last one of you on my quest for greater and greater power.

'There he is, up there'those circus clowns are tossing him back and forth,' said visibly relieved senior adviser Anita Dunn, waving her arms at the seven-term former U.S. senator, who was attempting to make an impassioned speech about his legislative record despite being severely entangled in aerial silks and dangling 50 feet in the air. 'Even if we got him down from there right now, we still wouldn't make it to the debate venue on time, and he does seem to be shouting his most important talking points at the guys playing those big Japanese drums and the two musclemen flying around on bungees. To be honest, I haven't seen him looking this coherent in a long time. Why don't we just let the vice president have a nice night for once?'

'This beautiful, intelligent woman right here'she got me through law school, she got me through my mayoral races, and she's going to get us to the White House. And Tad and Hayden, thank you for coming here today. But you better get going'Daddy knows you have homework to do!'

'We've also instructed our canvassers to confiscate any materials supporting other candidates. In some cases, we might actually take some men into custody and bring them back to campaign headquarters. This is a massive undertaking that will run well beyond Super Tuesday. We've already set up Bloomberg-branded vans in black neighborhoods across the country to spread our message. It'll all be worth it once these young black men hear what Bloomberg has to say about funding social security while they're pressed up against a brick wall with an elbow digging into their backs.'

'We originally planned to use a new app to tabulate votes, but after witnessing the difficulties experienced in Iowa's caucuses, we thought, 'Why not use an app to cast the votes, too?' It's far more efficient than systems we've used in the past, and the best part is that the results will be available as soon as'well, now, if you'd like them.'

The Onion takes a look at the pros and cons of abolishing the Senate. Founders devised Senate several generations before anyone could have even conceived of Oklahoma Haven't abolished anything in a while Senate building could make for some nice new downtown lofts Could lead to formation of fun new legislative body with cool name like The Assembly or The Council of Elders Senate serves as a safety valve in case democracy functioning too well Would be mean after Founding Fathers put so much work into it Kind of terrifying to think about what Mitch McConnell would get up to in private sector Derails career track for children of current senators "

'We all expected Biden to consolidate this group, but he has surprisingly struggled to connect with people who don't really want to consider why they're casting a vote. Instead, it's Klobuchar who looks to be the one speaking to their issues'which are vague and ill-defined. She's definitely an appealing choice for Democrats who blindly vote for any random candidate with a 'D' next to their name.'

'Bloomberg is continuing to perform poorly among African American men who were between 16 and 25 years old when they were arrested for possession of marijuana during his tenure as mayor of New York,' said lead pollster Nadia Bresner, confirming that fewer than 2% of survey respondents who were still serving prison sentences as a result of stop-and-frisk policies named Bloomberg as one of their top three favorite candidates. 'These numbers suggest that these individuals strongly connected to other candidates' policies of not having them detained and incarcerated based on their race. It remains to be seen if Bloomberg can bridge the gap of minorities he allowed to be terrorized by the police with another multimillion-dollar TV ad buy.' Bresner added that not all the poll numbers were bad for Bloomberg, noting that he was still beating Pete Buttigieg among young black men the mayor of South Bend had thrown into prison."

The newest numbers, which come from Emerson College, found that the 200-foot tall pillar, which reportedly has cryptic, glowing symbols engraved onto its surface, is now dominating among Democrats, Republicans, and independents. Several major polls also indicated that after the monolithic column suddenly materialized in a cornfield and began emitting a low humming noise, statisticians observed an extreme uptick in voters who previously supported Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren, Andrew Yang, Amy Klobuchar, Tom Steyer, Mike Bloomberg, and Donald Trump announcing in unison that they intended to cast their ballot for 'the one true candidate: the Obelisk.' 'From its late entrance into the race to the way it attracts people from all over the political spectrum, the Obelisk is really what you'd call a dark horse candidate,' said pollster Leslie Fabacher, adding that voters responded positively to its imposing figure and independent gravitational field. 'Sure, this arcane column made from some indeterminable material could have ended up another Tom Steyer or Michael Bloomberg, but now, Americans of virtually every demographic, regardless of age, gender, race, or religion, are connecting with the Obelisk's mesmerizing thrum.' 'Voters really seem to relate to this Washington outsider that comes from a realm unknown to science,' Fabacher added. According to pollsters, out of the 500 rural Indiana residents surveyed, over 99% pledged total obedience to the infallible Obelisk. In addition, respondents said that they felt confident about the future after gazing upon the constantly shifting runes emblazoned on the monolith. When asked if they would consider voting for a candidate other than the Obelisk, those surveyed were either heard screaming in pain or answered, 'The Obelisk is all; we are the Obelisk.' According to the Federal Election Commission, the Obelisk has already shattered all fundraising records as compliant Americans from across the country emptied their bank accounts and flocked to the mystifying pillar to drop all of their earthly possessions in front of it. Polls also showed that pro-Obelisk Democrats and Republicans did not mind that the Obelisk was registered with a party by the name of '[indecipherable runic language].' 'When I felt the rumble beneath me and saw a white-hot, screaming Obelisk suddenly appear out of thin air, I knew that was the candidate for me,' said Iowa voter Aaron Yalder, 49, adding that while he had been undecided for months, the Obelisk blinded him and commanded him to drop all other political allegiances. 'Sure, I like that Sanders supports the United Steelworkers Union. And I like that Trump is tough on crime. But there was just something about that deep, low voice, speaking in a language I could not comprehend, occupying my every thought and controlling my every move.' 'There is only the Obelisk,' Yalder added. 'How can you argue with that?' While the enigmatic column has only been in the race for less than 24 hours, the Obelisk has also secured the endorsements of numerous leading political figures, such as Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY), as well as former presidents Jimmy Carter, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama, who have all been spotted with the Obelisk, unconscious, floating hundreds of feet above the ground. Even organizations such as Priorities USA, America First, and Citizens United have thrown their support and money behind the mysterious pillar, citing it as 'The one choice. The only choice.' 'Look, when it comes to politics, there's no other candidate that has connected with all Americans past and all Americans future, and has pledged to reinstate the Clean Waters Act,' said Jessica Karling, a leader at SuperPac American Bridge, rending her clothes and filling the Obelisk's runes with the blood of her newborn. 'I've been doing this for over 50 years, and it's not just the fact I am its vessel and it is my one true God and I would murder anyone for the Obelisk, anyone, just tell me, I'll kill them'it's the fact that it really cares about the American people.' 'It's 2020, and this is going to be an election like we've never seen before,' she added while bowing down to the Obelisk and self-flagellating with a tulip tree branch. At press time, the Obelisk, which reportedly vaporized Senator Amy Klobuchar, after she denounced the monolith as divisive, immediately surged to a 100% approval rating."
111,Increasingly Unhinged Centrists Announce Plan To Round Up Nation Into Camps To Force Them To Engage In Meaningful Dialogue,"WASHINGTON'Explaining that they were forced to take more radical measures to ensure the success of their moderate political platform, increasingly unhinged U.S. centrists announced Monday their plan to round up the nation's populace into camps to force them to engage in meaningful dialogue. 'As more Americans adopt left-wing or right-wing views, compromise to a moderate position will require more drastic action, which is why we've decided to herd every last American into trains and bring them to camps encircled in barbed wire where they will be forced to discuss their views at gunpoint,' said a wild-eyed Leland Welsh, spokesperson for the centrist think tank Third Way, which was behind the funding of the large open-air detention center where divided Americans would be forced to shake hands until their palms bled and go without food and water until they had agreed to understand and embrace the positions of their political opponents. 'We believe that all Americans possess the capacity to find a middle ground on every single issue, which is why we're going to force their eyes open to read opinion pieces by their political adversaries, make them listen to speeches by Hillary Clinton and Mitt Romney blaring on loudspeakers 24 hours a day, and compel them to remain standing for long periods of time while our guards scream 'We can all get along!' In these camps, expressions of animosity toward another inmate's belief system, or uttering anything besides the phrase 'But that's just my opinion, and I'd love to hear yours' will be punishable by death. We will stop at nothing to ensure that all Americans hold the exact same centrist belief system.' The visibly crazed political centrists added that if the camps were unable to force any Americans to find common ground with one another, they would sell them in new slave markets to a company that would."

113,Buttigieg Touts Progress Connecting With Black Fortune 500 Executives,"SOUTH BEND, IN'Addressing concerns over his campaign's marked lack of inclusion, Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg touted significant progress he made Friday connecting with black Fortune 500 executives. 'I've heard your concerns, and over the past few weeks, I've made great efforts to not just talk to but listen to prominent members of the African American consulting community,' said the former South Bend mayor, emphasizing that he had hosted several round tables across the country where he had personal, one-on-one conversations with black VPs of weapons manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies, and Silicon Valley tech giants. 'While I might not have lived the same experiences, I hope that my campaign will feel inclusive to all executives of color, in all management levels, regardless of whether they attended Harvard or Yale. As someone who worked at McKinsey myself, I know firsthand that we can't win the presidency without them.' At press time, Buttigieg unveiled a new plan to diversify his campaign staff by hiring a single black finance executive to the Pete 2020 board."

'Sure, withholding military aid to an ally in wartime in order to secure an investigation into a political rival isn't the best, but it's wrong to squander all of this bright young man's potential over one little abuse of power,' said Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY), explaining that it would be easy to look back and find a time in pretty much anyone's life when they tried to compel a foreign government to interfere in a national election because they didn't know any better. 'It would be unfair to blemish this gifted young man's record forever just because he committed a single high crime in his 70s. Just ask yourself: do we really want this one miscarriage of public trust in democratic institutions to follow him for the rest of his life?' At press time, McConnell was heartened that an acquitted Trump still had an entire life of undermining democracy for his personal benefit ahead of him."
117,Trump Spends National Prayer Breakfast Attacking God For Allowing Impeachment To Ever Happen,"WASHINGTON'Unleashing a tirade on the supreme deity in an overtly partisan display at the traditionally nonpolitical event, President Donald Trump spent Thursday's National Prayer Breakfast fiercely attacking God for allowing impeachment to ever happen. 'As everyone knows, my family, your great country, and the presidency have been put through the ringer by this supposedly great God and the crooked angels who let this hoax happen,' said the president, boasting that his approval rating was far higher than the Lord's would ever be while holding aloft a copy of The Washington Post's front-page 'Trump acquitted' headline and quipping that the Almighty did not seem so all-powerful anymore. 'Honestly, folks, this is a very dishonest and corrupt creator we're talking about. He says He loves everybody, but He's really a fool and a liar. Frankly, our maker never should have been given the power to create the Universe, let alone pull the strings to humiliate me in front of the entire country. Hate to say it, but it's true.' At press time, the gathering of Christian preachers and prayer groups gave Trump a thunderous standing ovation after the president said that the Lord could eat shit and he was looking forward to when His Holiness finally died."
118,Sanders Makes Last-Minute Appeal To Moderates By Reminding Them All His Policies Would End Up Being Watered Down To Their Positions Anyway,"MANCHESTER, NH'In a last-minute attempt to court the much-sought-after demographic, Senator Bernie Sanders appealed to a town hall of moderates Thursday by reminding them all of his policies would wind up getting watered down enough to match their positions anyway. 'Listen, I understand many of you are nervous about my so-called radical stances on healthcare and abolishing ICE, but I'd urge you to remember they will ultimately be so diluted by the political process and left so utterly toothless that none of you could possibly oppose the end result,' said Sanders, assuring the center-left voters that since two-thirds of all Senate Democrats are on the record as not backing his Medicare For All proposal, even placing it on his website was at best wishful thinking compared to the sort of slight incremental progress that his White House would realistically be able to enact. 'Let's be honest here: Based on the center-leaning composition of Congress and where we stand ideologically as a country, my administration would be very lucky to even get a public option on the books. So what I'm saying here is don't worry. By the time the lobbyists get through with gutting my platform, it'll only be palatable to ineffectual middle-of-the-road voters like yourselves.' At press time, Sanders had received a standing ovation from the gathering after he closed his speech by noting that many of his far-left supporters would likely end up despising him for the compromises he would be forced to make as president."

'Watching the Democrats cower behind ineffectual high-minded rhetoric while the Republicans manipulated every procedure and spouted dangerous propaganda really affirmed my belief that today's U.S. government is working exactly as intended,' said 43-year-old retail manager Aaron Bennett, echoing the sentiments of 325 million Americans who confirmed that although the impeachment trial had shaken their faith in their leaders, watching the Democrats belatedly pursue a narrow goal that resisted meaningfully challenging any structural issues, only to let themselves be easily obstructed by Republican leaders committed to holding power regardless of the consequences, offered sorely needed reassurance of the strength of the U.S. political system. 'I was really worried impeachment indicated that the American way of life for the last several decades was at risk. I admit I even doubted whether our institutions could survive several Republicans deviating from their cynical embrace of an obvious criminal in order to further their callous agenda. The idea that Democrats were actually trying to pursue a moral objective instead of just using moral rhetoric as a smokescreen for accumulating influence really shook me. I'm just grateful that both parties were able to move past their differences and work together to uphold the American political system as we know it.' The relieved nation added that it would have been devastating if the Senate removed Trump, which would fly in the face of what the founding fathers wanted when they inscribed the principle of a few rich men shielding each other from accountability into the nation's Constitution."

'While I understand this medal represents the highest civilian honor possible, I was a bit disconcerted to discover this morning that I share this distinction with both a civil rights icon and a poet who gave a voice to black Americans,' said Limbaugh, who explained that he hopes people don't doubt his integrity as he joins the ranks of the award's previous recipients, especially Cicely Tyson, Ralph Ellison, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Stevie Wonder, and Willie Mays. 'I almost sent it back. But instead I have decided to keep my Medal of Freedom and let it stand as a testament to my willingness to tolerate others. I hope my acceptance of it will go some way toward reclaiming this honor from the Martin Luther Kings and Nelson Mandelas of the world.' At press time, Limbaugh confirmed he felt more confident that the award meant something after learning it had also been given to Henry Kissinger and Strom Thurmond."

'As of this morning, we have commissioned the design and manufacture of a cutting-edge tabulation device that will be able to legibly report vote totals on a sheet of paper 99% of the time,' said DNC chair Tom Perez, holding up a rough prototype of the 7.5-inch hexagonal marking implement, which will be built and rigorously stress-tested by a new Silicon Valley business venture known as Sharpen. 'It may not be easy to encase a cylinder of graphite with wood or put a slick coat of glossy paint on its outside. But with this new partnership, we believe we will soon have at our disposal a pencil that is both reliable and totally resistant to any attack by foreign powers. Also, because it can be sharpened, this new delegate-reporting tool can be used repeatedly, lasting us through New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina, and perhaps even Super Tuesday.' At press time, sources confirmed plans for the pencil had been scrapped after election security experts warned the rubber eraser on its tip would quickly erode public trust in the product."
125,DNC Blames Iowa Caucus Problems On Single Fuck-Up Senior Citizen Volunteer,"WASHINGTON'Claiming the 89-year-old woman's numerous blunders had caused the delay to the state's results, Democratic National Committee chair Tom Perez told reporters Tuesday that all problems with the Iowa Caucus could be blamed on a single fuck-up senior citizen volunteer. 'What it comes down to is that this costly and embarrassing mistake can be traced to one elderly volunteer named Muriel Luntz,' said Perez, adding that the party had hesitated on whether to release details about the Dubuque-based widow and five-time election volunteer, but ultimately decided to do so based on the gravity of Luntz's empty-headed missteps in singlehandedly derailing the first-in-the-nation caucus. 'Obviously, I don't want to speculate, but I don't think this woman is all there upstairs anymore. That's the only way I could imagine someone bungling our exceptional election security measures. It's a shame that just one numbskull could blemish the DNC's sterling record. So let me just say that I completely hear the outpouring of frustration from voters and want them to know that any of their outrage should be sent directly to her home address, which we'll be releasing online soon.' Perez also pledged that as an effort to tamp down on further mistakes, he would ensure that by the next election, the idiotic octagenarian would no longer be alive."

'He's obviously not our first choice, but Trump has a track record of winning elections, not to mention he does well with the conservative voters we'll need to swing some red states blue'if that's who we need to ask to ensure Bernie doesn't win, we'll do it,' said DNC chairman Tom Perez, who had circled Trump's name on a white board lising dozens of potential candidates the party could try to convince to jump into the Democratic Party primaries in order to obstruct a Sanders nomination. 'This late in the game, we need somebody with name recognition and a built-in following, which Trump definitely has. He has political experience working with Republicans, which will help him win over moderate voters who are turned off by the idea of a socialist president. Plus, he'll have the backing of the Democratic donor base, who generally prefer him to Sanders. Look, sometimes politics makes strange bedfellows, but I think I speak for party leadership when I say that we'd much rather see Donald Trump than Bernie Sanders as the Democratic nominee.' At press time, Perez was in negotiations to ensure Trump was on every Democratic primary ballot for Super Tuesday and changing the requirements to allow Trump to qualify for the next Democratic debate."
129,Report: Fighting Rising Tide Of Authoritarianism Sounds Like A Lot Of Work,"WASHINGTON'Confirming the challenges associated with preserving liberal democracy, the nation's top political scientists issued a report Friday that found fighting against the rising tide of authoritarianism sounds like a ton of work. 'After extensive analysis, we can state with a high degree of certainty that meaningfully resisting the erosion of equality and personal freedoms would probably be super exhausting,' said lead researcher Jeremy Dwyer, warning that stemming the flow of autocratic rule would require a sustained campaign of political pressure over a long period of time that would likely make Americans tired just to think about. 'Whether it's attending protests, campaigning for progressive candidates, or even committing to ethical purchasing habits, our data show that engaging at this level would be a whole thing that could eat up a bunch of time. The majority of American citizens are very sleepy and want to get back to their beds as soon as possible. Plus, this all sounds kind of like a big pain in the ass.' Dwyer added that the report concluded it would be so much easier to simply march in unthinking lockstep to an all-powerful ruler. "

'Look here, pal, fuck you and fuck anybody who thinks like you,' the former vice president said to a town hall participant in what political experts have hailed as a rousing call for Democrats, independents, and even moderate Republicans to join together in harmony and overcome the divisiveness and rancor that have characterized the Trump era. 'If that's what you believe, you're clearly an idiot, and I don't need your vote. Seriously, you and every single person in this fucking town deserves to die. Now back the hell up before I tear your throat out with my goddamn teeth.' After the event, a screaming, red-faced Biden reportedly continued to share his inspiring vision by informing a group of unwitting Iowans that he could beat their asses with one hand tied behind his back."

'We have not forgotten about the Palestinian people, and this roadmap will allow them to live in peace within the briny depths of the Mediterranean,' said Kushner, noting that the miles of open water represented a significant increase in Palestanian territory. 'This plan will also allow Palestine to place its capital directly in the Strait of Gibraltar, where it will be separated from Israeli territory by a sea wall. The Palestinians will be given every opportunity to swim and splash around as long as they don't attempt to impede on Israeli sovereignty by trying to crawl out of the water or wash up on the beach.' Kushner added that as a further concession to the Palestinain people, the plan would include a four-year freeze before Israelis could annex the Mediterranean and drive the Palestinians into the Atlantic Ocean."
133,Sanders Unveils Job-Training Program To Provide Meaningful Work To Low-Skilled Op-Ed Writers,"WASHINGTON'Explaining that as president he would ensure his policies didn't leave any Americans behind, Senator Bernie Sanders reportedly unveiled plans Wednesday for a job-training program that would provide meaningful work to low-skilled op-ed writers. 'I understand that if I win the presidency, many Americans are concerned about the effect that changing economic priorities will have on their jobs, which is why I'm committed to making sure that the nation's unskilled columnists receive every opportunity to learn material skills that will enable them to find a rewarding position,' said Sanders, adding that his platform allocated hundreds of millions of dollars a year to ensure workers like opinion columnists who lacked qualifications for any skilled labor job would receive instruction in a career of their choice, such as nursing, childcare, or construction. 'It's true that not every industry makes sense for the world we need to build, whether it's coal mining, private health insurance, or writing histrionic editorials with little factual basis in our nation's newspapers. It pains me to see so many op-ed writers out there who have received so little training or education that they have no capacity to do viable work. But I believe that these op-ed writers and editorial board members want to be productive members of society, and my presidency will do everything it can to help them find work with dignity.' Sanders added that it was an unfortunate result of the U.S. economic system that so many Americans found themselves stuck in low-skilled op-ed writing jobs in the first place."
134,Chris Matthews Warns Bernie Sanders Victory Runs Risk Of Making Him Look Stupid 2 Elections In A Row,"NEW YORK'Cautioning voters against walking down such a dangerous path without fully understanding the potential consequences, MSNBC pundit Chris Matthews warned Hardball viewers Tuesday that Bernie Sanders winning the Democratic party's nomination would run the risk of making him look stupid in two consecutive elections. 'Before anyone casts a vote for Senator Sanders in the primary, they need to look deep inside and consider the ramifications of making me look like a completely out-of-touch idiot again,' said Matthews, insisting that a strong showing from Sanders in early-voting primaries could lead to the complete and utter destruction of the American political commentator's credibility. 'We can't afford to go down the same road we did in 2016. The cost is simply too great to have another four years of me feeling like a clueless fucking moron. Is that a risk Bernie supporters are willing to take?' At press time, a teary-eyed Matthews brought Hardball to a close by asserting that a Sanders presidency could negatively affect him for decades."

Joni Ernst (R-IA) told reporters Tuesday that she still hadn't seen any evidence in the impeachment process that had changed her self-serving political calculus. 'I've kept an open mind from the beginning, but nothing I have seen thus far has altered the fundamental nature of my reelection prospects in my home state,' said Ernst, adding that while some of the president's actions have been questionable, she didn't believe they had risen to a level that would harm her standing amongst conservative Iowa voters. 'Though they've had plenty of opportunities, Democrats have failed to make a persuasive case that Trump's behavior would lead to my constituents abandoning me en masse, and unless I see some arguments of that nature soon, I think my mind is made up.' Ernst added that she took this responsibility seriously as she had given a sacred oath to consolidate her grip on power by whatever means necessary."
136,Key Players In Trump's Impeachment Trial,"The House of Representatives approved articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump on December 18, 2019, then sent those articles to the Senate for a formal trial, a process that has involved a whirlwind of figures from Congress, the legal world, and Trump's orbit.

The hesitant speaker of the House eventually pushed through articles of impeachment, while making it clear she never thought through any of this. Donald Trump is the 45th and current president of the United States. As the lead impeachment manager, there was no better choice to provide the heavy-handedness, Russia hysteria, and whiff of corruption the Democrats needed to ensure the nation tuned out. The longtime White House maid is said to have been a witness to many of the events in question. But is she more than she seems?"
137,CBS Inks Deal For 30-Episode Bloomberg Ad,"NEW YORK'Citing its productive relationship with the multibillionaire in the two months since he announced his candidacy, CBS officials confirmed Tuesday that the network had inked a deal to air a 30-episode advertisement for Michael Bloomberg's presidential campaign. 'We've had a great run with Mayor Bloomberg's shorter ads, so we're thrilled to welcome him into our lineup with a full series of hour-long episodic commercials,' said a spokesperson for the television network, indicating the commercials will run immediately after NCIS on Tuesdays, though independent reports have confirmed they will also re-air throughout the week as often as the former New York mayor wants them to. 'Mike is a relentless, self-made presidential candidate we think will really resonate with viewers when they are given this opportunity to see the full arc of his run for the White House. We have his campaign merchandise for sale in CBS's online store, and with any luck, we'll soon be in talks about a second 30-episode ad. Frankly, we're willing to keep this running for as many seasons as the mayor would like.' CBS officials said the deal included a proposed crossover episode of Young Sheldon in which Bloomberg would guest star, warning the Cooper family about the dangers of consuming large, sugary drinks."

'Make no mistake: America will not sit idly by while someone or other engages in what we say are continued irrefutable acts of aggression,' said Pompeo, emphasizing that the United States reserves the right to exercise full military might in order to protect its political and economic interests wherever. 'Although the nation in question may be an undetermined or undefined distance from America's borders, it remains crucial to protect our sovereignty and come to the aid of our allies, if any, in someplace, somewhere on the globe. We even have good reason to suspect that pretty much anyone anywhere is currently in the process of developing a nuclear arsenal.' Pompeo also confirmed that the Pentagon had detailed contingency plans for possible preemptive strikes on everywhere."
142,Liberals Say Sanders's Acceptance Of Rogan Endorsement Sends Dangerous Message He Trying To Win Election,"WASHINGTON'Slamming the campaign for promoting the popular podcaster's backing, liberals said Friday that Bernie Sanders's acceptance of Joe Rogan's endorsement sends a dangerous message that the candidate is trying to win the 2020 presidential election. 'This is just the Sanders campaign opening the gates to a plurality of people who would vote for him and help him win the presidency,' said political commentator Scott Griffin, who called the campaign's promotion of Rogan's endorsement a true 'mask off' moment, exposing Sanders's goal of winning the Democratic primary and eventually the general election. 'It's very unnerving to see a Democratic candidate like Bernie Sanders try to court voters from varying constituencies and demographics. It's like his whole strategy is beating Trump. We saw hints of this in 2016, but I'm truly sickened to see it rearing its ugly head again. I'm all for creating a Democratic majority, but not if we have to accept more people than the other side has.' Griffin added that it was even more disturbing that Sanders would attempt this during an election year."
143,Melting Giraffe Congressman Warns Impeachment Distracting From Surreal Issues,"WASHINGTON'Arguing that a protracted congressional trial wasn't in the best interests of everyday floating nude Americans, melting giraffe congressman Fauna Anuaf reportedly warned Friday that focusing on the impeachment of President Donald Trump was distracting from the surreal issues. 'When there are so many people in this country imprisoned inside two-dimensional towers or struggling with their legs turning into water, we cannot let ourselves get caught up in a biased proceeding that does nothing to address the surreal problems many Americans face,' said the melting giraffe congressman (E-EEE), adding that in his district, residents were worried about biomorphic trains materializing through their walls, orca whales trapped in bottles on an endless desert landscape, or being flayed on a fainting couch while three heads in bowler hats screamed that their body is a chorus of bodies diffusing under the heat of time itself, not some court proceeding. 'The moment my constituents poured candle wax into the endless thermometer to elect me to Congress, I took their wailing approval as a solemn reminder to keep focused on the surreal issues. At every town hall back in my inverted ether, my constituents come to slice my eyeball, which I understand as a sign that impeachment doesn't enjoy broad support.

144,Trump Makes Powerful Pro-Life Case By Speaking About The Joys Of Neglecting A Child,"WASHINGTON'Speaking to thousands of March For Life protesters assembled on the National Mall, President Donald Trump took to the stage Friday to make a powerful pro-life case about the joys of neglecting a child. 'Of course, I'm a father, and I had my thoughts about terminating them all, but I'm standing before you today to tell you that I'm glad I didn't because I would never have gotten to experience the simple but incredible pleasures of pawning them off on the help for the first decade or so of their lives,' said Trump, defending the anti-abortion movement with a stirring speech about how profoundly being an absent and indifferent father had affected his life. 'I wish I could describe to you how good it feels to avoid every soccer game and piano recital, and how incredible it's been watching them grow from a child I couldn't care less about to an adult I barely know. Whether it's Ivanka, Don Jr., or one of the other two, they've each been a blessing that I never would have known if they had been aborted.' Trump went on to bring several audience members to tears by describing in detail the moment he first realized he'd be able to bully and emotionally terrorize his children forever. "

'These horrible rules created by Barack Obama are one of the worst examples of government overreach in our nation's history, and they are totally unfair to the deadly leviathan known as Gangthor,' said Trump, who was later overheard muttering ancient incantations reportedly intended to loosen the cursd chains that shackle the nefarious shadow-behemoth to the ocean floor. 'I will personally swim to the bottom of the Pacific and use a golden key inscribed with mysterious runes to unlock Gangthor's lair, where he has slumbered since the destructive Clean Water Rule of 2015 was issued. This shape-shifting, multi-tentacled monster will then once more be unleashed upon the waters of the United States, restoring the property rights of American farmers, fossil fuel companies, and real estate developers.' The president went on to criticize 'prophets of doom' who have predicted Gangthor the Malevolent will rise in a column of smoke and fire upon his release, blocking out the sun and blighting the earth with a thousand years of darkness."

'As you address members of this deliberative body, please bear in mind that nothing you say or do will have any effect on the completely predetermined outcome of these proceedings,' said Roberts, exhorting the two sides to go ahead and establish facts, promulgate lies, cite the Constitution, or engage in purely cynical bad-faith arguments, because none of it really mattered anyway. 'I wish to remind you this trial is a hollow exercise of decorum with no possibility of achieving productive results of any kind. We're just going through the motions here, we all know how it is going to end, so let's at least try to keep it brief.' At press time, the chief justice had commended both sides for heeding his admonition and working to keep the monumental miscarriage of justice running smoothly."

'Resolved that effective immediately, all questions, witness statements, and other utterances must include a recommendation to eat at Wingstop, and the Wingstop logo must be clearly visible on all name placards, subpoenaed documents, and other written material,' read Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) from the resolution on the Senate floor, adding that Wingstop's $25 million deal to sponsor the impeachment trial was the best offer Congress received and ignoring pleas from Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) to wait for Panera Bread to finalize its proposal. 'This resolution also stipulates that each senator must be photographed with Wingstop's lemon pepper wings on each day of the trial as part of our promotion, all social media posts about the impeachment must be accompanied with the #RightWingstop hashtag, and that the only food permitted in the chamber will be Wingstop wing combos with fries or veggie sticks and a 20-ounce soft drink. This is in order to ensure the impeachment trial remains a place where flavor gets its wings. Democracy works best when we're full of chicken.' The resolution did make an exception, however, for Chief Justice John Roberts, who informed the Senate that the Wingstop contract could not apply to him, as he has an exclusive sponsorship with Buffalo Wild Wings."
149,Contrarian 'New York Times' Travel Section Breaks With Paper To Endorse Deval Patrick For Democratic Nomination,"NEW YORK'In a dramatic challenge of the editorial board, The New York Times travel section broke with the paper Tuesday to endorse former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick for the Democratic nomination. 'Given his impressive track record as a card-carrying Hyatt Loyalty Program member and the only candidate with TSA PreCheck, we are left no choice but to split with the main body of this organization and endorse Deval Patrick,' said travel editor Amy Virshup, explaining that the section's values have been diverging from the rest of the newspaper for years and that The Time's co-endorsement of Klobuchar and Warren did not reflect the values of American jet-setters nearly as well as Patrick. 'Patrick thoroughly impressed us with his comprehensive plan for the best way to spend 36 hours in Marrakech, and proved he's ready to lead with his extensive knowledge of everything from using concierge services to where to find the best bar in the Seattle area. Whether you prefer a family vacation or a romantic getaway, for the conscientious traveler, there is no better candidate than Deval Patrick.' At press time, an emergent Deval Patrick had picked up endorsements from every major American newspaper's travel section."

'Dr. Martin Luther King, who was known for his nonviolent tactics, including protests and community organizing, would certainly have traveled abroad to pressure foreign nations to expose a political enemy's secrets,' said Conway, who explained that if King were alive today, he would without a doubt hop on a flight to Kiev to meet with Ukrainian government officials to acquire potentially damaging information about Biden's younger son, Hunter. 'While much of the United States remains divided, Dr. King had a brave and bold vision hinged on withholding aid from Ukraine for personal political purposes. He understood that civil disobedience is essential in fighting a corrupt system, so he wasn't afraid to spend the night in jail or do a little quid pro quo. In fact, some of his most famous tweets were written from jail.' Conway added that it was a shame such a great civil rights leader had been impeached so young."

'The House peach managers [sic] are never, ever gonna be able to find dad way deep in here!' said Donald Trump Jr., who stapled a note with the message 'definitely no president inside' to blankets as an extra security precaution while Eric Trump punched air holes through the pillows with a pair of scissors. 'Stay right there, dad, and don't move till 2050. We read through the whole constant tuition [sic] and it says those guys can't impeach you if they can't find you. Here are two pieces of bread for dinners, and a straw you can use as a snorkel. Close your eyes real tight and you'll be totally invisible. Okay, see you later.

'Look, as senators, we swore a solemn oath to deliver justice, and I intend to abide by that precisely as we use this trial to scrutinize the facts and then determine exactly how'and indeed, if'we will storm into the Oval Office, hoist the delighted president aloft, and regale him with spirited rounds of 'Hip, hip, hurray,'' said Sen. Mitch McConnell, noting that his awesome responsibility as the chamber's majority leader required him to tamp down on any partisan speculation on whether Senate Republicans would rush to raise the president up onto their shoulders while singing 'He's A Jolly Good Fellow' or if Senate Republicans would opt for a more stately procession in which they conveyed the recently acquitted Trump past each and every Democratic congressperson's office. 'Unlike some of my liberal colleagues, I understand my solemn role in this trial is to examine all the information at hand before passing judgment. Then, and only then, can we know whether it's a reasonable course of action to deploy some form of red-white-and-blue confetti while repeatedly tossing President Trump into the air. Until then, it would simply be irresponsible to comment on whether or not we will incorporate party horns, noisemakers, or a big cake covered with lit sparklers into the proceedings.' At press time, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin had commended McConnell on his commitment to impartiality as they came to a swift conclusion on whether or not they should cue up Kool and the Gang's 'Celebration' on the Senate's speaker system."
154,CNN Reveals Bernie Sanders Running For President Of Country With History Of Sexism,"WASHINGTON'Calling their bombshell report incredibly damning, CNN revealed Thursday that Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders has been knowingly running a campaign to become president of a country with a long history of sexism. 'This new evidence proves beyond a doubt that Bernie Sanders strongly wants to lead a nation that has repeatedly enabled, supported, and encouraged misogyny,' said Anderson Cooper in a breaking news segment, claiming to have several documents directly linking Sanders to a country that did not even allow women to vote until the 20th century. 'Right here is a transcript of the text this woman-hating country was founded upon, a country which he willfully lives in and has publicly sworn an oath to, mind you. On just the first page it explicitly declares that all men are created equal, with absolutely no mention of women. And down here'look closely at these signatures that ratified this document as the supreme law of the land. You guessed it, all men.' At press time, CNN confirmed that Sanders had not yet denied his close ties to this country nor its tens of millions of residents with deeply ingrained biases against women."
155,Stephen Miller Hurt At Being Passed Over For Job Stalking Female Ambassador,"WASHINGTON'After learning that Ukraine police had opened an investigation into whether associates of the president had surveilled the diplomat in Kyiv last year, White House senior advisor Stephen Miller was reportedly upset Thursday at being passed over for a job stalking female U.S. ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. 'When I found out that some of Giuliani's goons had been tailing the ambassador around Ukraine, my heart just sank'I mean, how could they decide to follow a lady around and not pick me to do the job?' said Miller, who added that after all the thankless tasks he had performed for the Trump administration over three-plus years in office, he figured he would be at the top of the list when a plum gig like stalking a woman on the administration's behalf came along. 'If I had known there was an opening for shadowing an important lady, I would've absolutely thrown my hat in the ring. Maybe I got passed over because I'm already stalking a bunch of women here in the U.S., but I still would've been able to manage my time and make it work. It really hurts that they didn't even bother to ask. It would be one thing if I didn't have any experience in tracking women without them knowing, but I'm really good at it. I can keep quiet in an alleyway, or stay awake idling in the car, or huddle in a closet without a peep for hours. And I'm really good at gathering hair and undergarments. I just wish they'd given me a chance.' At press time, Miller had decided to cheer himself up by lying below the former ambassador's bed wearing her clothing while she was asleep."

'While at first, the recording only picks up Biden shaking hands and joking with his fellow candidates, we eventually hear him tapping on the mic and whispering, 'Oh, what is this? Come to papa,'' said CNN audio engineer Kristen Jennings, adding that the former vice president can then be heard sniffing the lavalier, licking it once, and then sticking it directly into his mouth. 'After hours of analysis, our team has determined that Biden then attempted to chew the mic before saying 'ew' and spitting it out onto the ground. Then, a few minutes later, he decided to pick it back up, pop it back into his mouth, chew it, and ultimately, swallow it.' At press time, CNN confirmed that the microphone's audio had also picked up ample evidence that Biden had successfully passed the mic two days later."

'I have overturned the decision to assassinate Gen. Soleimani and ordered our military to rescind the Jan. 3 drone strike that destroyed his convoy at Baghdad International Airport,' said Trump, who explained the move would revoke Soleimani's status as a Shiite martyr and decrease the likelihood of the United States being drawn into an unpopular war with Iran. 'The U.S. Air Force operation that killed the general was conducted without the consent of Congress and, more significantly, without the backing of the American people. So today our forces in the region will take immediate action to return Soleimani to his family unexploded. This doesn't mean we won't take him out in a future operation if surveys indicate a majority of swing-state voters approve of such an action, but for now we will allow him to resume command of the Quds Force.' The president added that he has yet to see any polls that would convince him to retract his October decision to let Turkey kill hundreds of Kurdish civilians in Syria."
160,Biden Asks Advisors How Much Longer He Has To Pretend To Be Confused And Doddering To Avoid Criticism,"DES MOINES, IA'Cutting off his chief strategist midway through a daily meeting to express his unwillingness to continue the deception much longer, former Vice President Joe Biden reportedly asked advisors Wednesday how much longer he has to go through the routine of acting confused and doddering in order to avoid criticism. 'Please, guys, I'm so tired of putting on this whole song-and-dance of stumbling over my words at every public appearance and painfully wincing so it seems like I've completely forgotten a foreign leader's name,' said the presumptive frontrunner, looking at each and every one of his advisors with clear, thoughtful eye contact, while stressing that although his consistent lead in polling showed the strategy had worked spectacularly to shield him from any critique of his record, he also longed to drop this 'entire frail-old-man act' and speak to audiences in full sentences that allowed him to robustly articulate his vision for restoring America's soul. 'Just give me a date when I can start fully enunciating my words in TV spots. That's all. Obviously, I can keep doing the simple stuff like biting my wife's finger or challenging audience members to push-up contests seemingly out of nowhere. I know you think that's helpful. I get that it would sink me in the polls if I were held accountable for past statements and actions, but frankly it's just exhausting to be constantly acting this mentally confused when I know I can be so much stronger out there.' At press time, Biden was begging his advisors to at least never again make him punch himself midway through a debate to give the appearance of his eye filling up with blood."

Shows populace consequences for insisting on being born powerless in dictatorship. More difficult to quantify deaths they cause than straight-up war. Just nice to have something to announce every once in a while. Only harms people without power to retaliate. Innocent money drawn into other parties' conflict. Probably involve at least some math. Damn it. We wanted to travel there one day. Shit. Denies thousands of citizens sweet taste of Pepsi Max. Not as satisfying to invade country whose citizens already sick and starving to death."

'Help! Help! Can anyone hear me? I don't understand where my donors are if they're not in this cooler,' said Buttigieg, who had reportedly breezed through the diner, ignoring its clientele, before asking a line cook where the back room with all the wealthy campaign funders was located, getting frustrated at the man's confusion, and deciding to find it himself by searching for a hidden passageway as the freezer door locked behind him. 'I don't understand'it's usually right here. They have to hide in the back so we can meet in secret outside the prying eyes of the media and all the poor people. Where is the manager? Why on earth would I enter a rinky-dink joint just to hobnob with a bunch of people eating scrambled eggs and getting five bucks for my trouble when I know there's a cushy hidden back room where I can talk to voters who matter over a glass of champagne? Jesus Christ, where's [spokesperson] Lis [Smith] when I need her? I don't know what I'm going to do. I already called for help in eight languages, and I'm starting to get really cold.' At press time, Buttigieg had resorted to doing his campaign's 'High Hopes' dance in an effort to stay warm."

'We want to have an honest discussion about policies and positions, so if you have any vicious insults or cheap shots you want to take, we ask that you hold back until we have you mic'd up and sitting somewhere cushy,' said moderator Wolf Blitzer, who added that in the offhand chance candidates didn't have anything negative to say, a CNN producer would be able to assist them by offering them a glass of champagne or shot of tequila and some helpful prompts. 'Verbal abuse will not be tolerated on the debate stage, but if you want to call Pete Buttigieg a spineless little bitch in front of the confession cam, we ask that you please go off. Voters have an important choice to make, so we ask that you let any unpleasant feelings build up inside of you until you have the opportunity to get backstage and explode. Crying for an hour and then falling asleep in front of the confession cam is simply standard debate etiquette.' Blitzer added that the footage would be shared in a two-hour-long special following the debate."

'All of them'you have 30 seconds,' said Blitzer, gesturing toward an unlabeled anatomical diagram of the female reproductive organs. 'As a progressive candidate, this is your opportunity to show your advocacy for women's rights once and for all by listing every part of the female genitalia, internal and external, in alphabetical order and then from largest to smallest. Don't forget any of the ligaments or blood vessels.' At press time, Sanders attempted to transition to discussing policy before being cut off and forced to draw the vulva."

'Here's what I'm thinking: We just rattle off an email to Tom's campaign mentioning that we hadn't gotten his $2.5 million debate fee, see if any of his staffers bat an eye, and then take things from there,' said CNN president Jeff Zucker, noting that his team had already received prompt and courteous payment from Steyer's campaign after sending them an itemized list suggesting the network required reimbursement for the candidate's podium and microphone alongside a per-question fee for Wolf Blitzer's time. 'Early on, I told one of his chief aides that we were going to bill them for every word he uttered, and he just nodded and said 'uh-huh, sounds good.' God, he was actually surprised that we were charging them so much less than PBS had at the last debate.' At press time, Steyer was spotted frantically searching his suit pockets after a stage tech informed the businessman that he had failed to compensate the network with $500 for its customary entrance fee."

According to eyewitnesses, absent Booker's ideals of sympathy for those with different viewpoints and compassion for one's political enemies, a series of violent attacks erupted among the candidates, with Joe Biden taking a tire iron to a campaign bus Pete Buttigieg had driven at full speed through a group of the former vice president's canvassers. The sudden lack of caring and cooperation in the political atmosphere also reportedly led Amy Klobuchar to drag Andrew Yang by the hair through the streets of Des Moines, kick the entrepreneur unconscious, and throw him into a river. At press time, Mike Bloomberg is said to have responded to the primary race's new climate by going door-to-door and pistol-whipping dozens of working-class Iowans until they agreed to vote for him."
168,Sanders Campaign Doubles Down With New Ad Warning Americans They'll Never Be Able To Hear A Female President Over The Sound Of Her Vacuum,"DES MOINES'Responding to accusations by members of the Elizabeth Warren campaign that he told her in a 2018 conversation that he didn't believe a woman could win the presidency, the Bernie Sanders campaign doubled down Tuesday with a new television ad warning Americans that they'll never be able to hear a female president over the sound of her vacuum. 'I do not believe that we as Americans can risk electing a female candidate who won't address universal healthcare or climate change over the loud racket of her vacuum cleaner coming from the Oval Office 24 hours a day,' said Sanders over an ominous 30-second black-and-white shot of panicked advisors fleeing a national security meeting when the female president, a woman with a beehive hairdo, high heels, and an apron, accidentally filled the room with thick smoke after burning a pan of cookies in the briefing room oven. 'When you make your decision about the Democratic nominee, consider whether you want a president who is divided between making policy decisions and scrubbing the floors, or trying to take care of our veterans when she's preoccupied with her crying baby. Not to mention the hair dryer whirring all day and night as the lady president does her hair. And how does she expect to keep America safe when she's constantly distracting our top generals by asking them for help opening difficult jars? Maybe we as a nation will be ready for a female president in 2024, if technology has improved so that vacuums are quieter, but until then we can't afford to take the chance.' The Warren campaign reportedly responded with a fundraising email stating that the candidate was disappointed that Sanders had called her every single day since 2016 to say that women should never be allowed in public without a male escort but that she didn't want to discuss the matter further and risk being divisive."
169,Swing Voter Really Relates To Buttigieg's Complete Lack Of Conviction,"DES MOINES, IA'Praising the former South Bend, IN mayor as a 'true champion' of nothing in particular, local swing voter Chris Fernsby told reporters Tuesday he felt a deep connection with presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg's complete lack of conviction. 'As a generally noncommittal person without any firm ideas about how our government should be run, I can see a lot of myself in this up-and-coming young leader with no discernible political identity,' said Fernsby, who added that Buttigieg's vague but carefully focus-grouped positions on Medicare for All and police reform perfectly captured his own indecisive and shifting mindset when it came to issues at stake in the 2020 election. 'Do I have strong views on affordable housing or how much public college tuition should cost? No. But you know what? Neither does Pete Buttigieg. When I listen to his uplifting, substance-free rhetoric, the only thing I can tell for sure is that he really, really wants to be president. And that's good enough for me!' Fernsby went on to add that while he intended to support Buttigieg for the Democratic nomination, he still planned to vote for President Trump in the general election."

'I've spent my whole life worrying about my career, chasing the next big position, but after spending all this time in Iowa, I've realized it's community and family that count,' said Booker, who revealed he's taken a position at the local auto parts store, bought a cute little ranch house, and started volunteering at a nursing home. 'The air is fresher, the people are nicer, and everyone knows your name. I've found peace here. I was working my ass off every day, and for what? To be president of the United States? To pass some immigration plan? That stuff doesn't matter. I just want a quiet garden and people who love me.' Booker added that while girlfriend Rosario Dawson was thinking about moving in, she was more interested in a place with a little more hustle and bustle like Fort Dodge."
172,Prominent Evangelical Magazine Calls For Removing Trump From Holy Trinity,"CAROL STREAM, IL'In a scathing opinion piece published Thursday by Christianity Today, the evangelical magazine's editor-in-chief Mark Galli made the case for President Trump's removal from the Holy Trinity. 'The president has demonstrated repeatedly that he lacks the ethical convictions necessary for us to continue worshipping him as a part of the triune God,' said Galli, explaining that when Trump was seated at the right hand of the Father, many Christians assumed his behavior would by extension be righteous and godly, but this has not been the case. 'While it is not a decision we undertake lightly, our position is firm: If we do not reverse course now'if we continue to accept Mr. Trump as our Lord and Savior in spite of his blackened moral record'who will take the evangelical community seriously in the years to come?' Galli's editorial goes on to reassure readers the magazine supports the deification of Vice President Pence, who in the event of Trump's removal would ascend to a place alongside the Father and the Holy Spirit."
173,DNC Bows To Pressure By Adding Andrew Cuomo To Increase Ethnic Representation On Debate Stage,"LOS ANGELES'In response to criticism that its threshold for participation has reduced the diversity on stage, the Democratic National Committee announced it would increase ethnic representation in Thursday night's debate by allowing New York governor Andrew Cuomo to take part. 'We heard loud and clear from Democratic voters how important it is to have a panel of debaters that reflects the diverse fabric of America, and so we're grateful to Gov. Cuomo for agreeing to join tonight's event on such short notice,' said DNC spokesperson Philip Aldridge, adding that now more than ever it was vital for Democrats to show they are the party of all Americans, whether they be white, Sicilian, Sardinian, or even Venetian. 'Inclusion is at the heart of everything the DNC strives for, and Italian Americans are a group that, especially if you look back at the late 19th and early 20th centuries, has been historically underrepresented in positions of power. What better way to show that the Democratic Party truly cares about people of color?' At press time, DNC officials had confirmed that due to space restrictions, Cuomo would be given Andrew Yang's podium at the debate."
174,DNC Eases Debate Requirements To 0.1% Above Whatever Cory Booker Polling,"WASHINGTON'In response to the presidential candidate's criticism of the party's current rules that have left him unqualified for tonight's Democratic debate, the DNC announced Thursday that they have eased the debate requirements to 0.1% above whatever number Cory Booker was polling. 'We've considered Senator Booker's comments and have agreed to change the overly stringent prerequisites to include those candidates who poll just a fraction of a percentage above him,' said DNC chairman Tom Perez, adding that these less strict qualifications would be tied to a constantly sliding scale contingent on how Senator Booker's campaign was doing at any point during the race, opening up the debate stage to a more inclusive group of Democrats who had low polling numbers that were still higher than Booker's. 'We've also taken the extra step of adjusting the number of necessary donations from 200,000 unique donors to whatever number makes Booker come up just shy of qualifying. We want to thank Senator Booker for pointing out this injustice after he learned that he would not be eligible for the upcoming debate, and we hope that this compromise satisfies Senator Booker's request.' Perez added that the threshold may be relaxed even more to allow any Democratic candidate still in the race onto the debate stage after Cory Booker drops out."
175,Trump Claims He Knows John Dingell Is In Hell Because He Sees Window Into Terrifying Inferno Every Time He Closes His Eyes,"WASHINGTON'Clarifying controversial remarks he made about the deceased Michigan lawmaker last night, Donald Trump told reporters Thursday he can confirm the late congressman John Dingell is in hell because of the window into a terrifying inferno the president sees every time he closes his eyes. 'Each night, when I lie down in bed, I feel the heat of eternal flames and hear the screams of the damned,' said Trump, explaining that he has gazed into the hideous abyss and seen Satan himself feasting upon the maggot-infested corpse of the long-serving former representative. 'John's definitely down there along with all the other poor souls crying out to be released from ceaseless torment. He's always whispering that the fate awaiting me will be far, far worse than his, beyond anything I could possibly comprehend. Why do you think I barely sleep?' Members of the White House press pool were then seen running from the briefing room as the blood drained from the president's face, his eyes rolled back in his head, and, using an inhumanly deep, guttural voice, he began to mutter strange incantations in Latin."
176,GOP Turns Dozens Of House Democrats Away From Impeachment For Failing To Provide Adequate Voter ID,"WASHINGTON'Warning that allowing them to vote without proper documentation would undermine the sanctity of the democratic process, the House GOP turned away dozens of Democrats from impeaching President Donald Trump Wednesday after determining they did not have adequate voter ID. 'This is simply a precautionary measure to make sure that these individuals are, in fact, real U.S. representatives who would be eligible to engage in this process,' said Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), telling reporters that he had been forced to prevent numerous members, including John Lewis, Maxine Waters, and James Clyburn, from entering the congressional chamber since they had not been able to show two forms of government-issued identification, as well as a utility bill, to establish residency. 'Yes, providing adequate ID is a little annoying, but without oversight, these so-called members of Congress could run amok, voting in multiple districts and leading to a fraudulent impeachment. We simply cannot allow this to happen, so if we come across any representatives who appear suspicious, it's imperative we make sure they're thoroughly scrutinized.' Gaetz added that in order to relieve exhausted congressional staffers, impeachment voting had closed several hours early."
177,Congressman Could've Sworn Last Impeachment Was Catered,"WASHINGTON'Looking around the chamber for some sort of food station, Congressman Don Young (R-AK) told reporters Wednesday that he could've sworn the last impeachment hearing he attended was catered. 'When we were impeaching Clinton in the '90s, I'm pretty sure there was a whole spread with, like, soups and sandwiches and a prime rib carving station,' said a peckish Young, explaining that he purposefully didn't bring lunch today because he assumed the House of Representatives would be providing them with a buffet. 'I asked an aide where the grub was, and she told me she could order food for me but I'd have to pay for it'can you believe it? I mean, not even a make-your-own pasta bar for exercising our constitutional duties. At the very least, they could have provided us with some danishes or something.' When it was representative Young's turn to have the floor, sources confirmed he delivered an impassioned diatribe blasting the lack of free food."
178,Poll Finds 54% Of Americans Approve Executing Trump But Leaving Him In Office,"HAMDEN, CT'According to a new poll out Wednesday from Quinnipiac University, 54% of Americans approve of President Trump receiving the death penalty, but believe his transgressions have not risen to a level that warrants removal from office. 'While nearly all survey participants agreed the president should be executed in a highly public setting, only a minority thinks he should receive a proper burial, with more than half stating that the deceased commander-in-chief should be allowed to complete his four-year term,' said polling analyst Rebecca Glenski, explaining that the results indicate an unwillingness among Americans to effectively overturn the outcome of a presidential election. 'Of that 54%, approximately two-thirds said that after he is put to death'preferably by hanging, beheading, or crucifixion'Trump should not only remain in the Oval Office but also be permitted to appear at public events, attend official White House functions, and have a seat at global summits like the G7. In addition, most respondents strongly indicated the president's corpse should stand for re-election next year so the people can decide whether to remove his earthly remains from office.' Polling suggests in 2020 the bloated, lifeless body of Trump would continue to enjoy a strong, built-in advantage in the Electoral College."
179,Congress Reaches $1.4 Trillion Spending Deal To Award Entire Budget To One Lucky American,"WASHINGTON'Praising bipartisan efforts that prevented a government shutdown ahead of the holiday season, Congress reportedly reached a $1.4 trillion spending deal Tuesday to award the entire budget to one lucky American. 'This is going to provide a completely new life for a single and very, very fortunate American,' said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, explaining that anyone who pays taxes is eligible to win except for employees and family members of those working for the federal government. 'We were happy to see both sides step up and make concessions, including the size of the novelty check, who will pull the balls from the raffle drum, and the decision to eliminate the Social Security and Medicare programs. Winners can spend the money on whatever they like, and have the choice between receiving a lump sum or annuity payments of a billion dollars over the next thousand years or so. Second and third place winners will receive a 10-speed bike and $10 Amazon gift certificate respectively.' At press time, sources confirmed that this is only the third time the U.S. government has held such a lottery, which is credited to creating both the Carnegie and Rockefeller fortunes. "
180,And Then Those 12 People Send It To 12 People'That's 144 People!' Says Cory Booker Describing Campaign Newsletter Strategy To Rosario Dawson,"NEWARK'Referring to the 'surefire' system as a sort of pyramid of communication, Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker excitedly walked long-term girlfriend and actress Rosario Dawson through his new network-based strategy to distribute campaign newsletters, sources confirmed Monday. 'And then when those people share it, the 144 turns into over 20,000 people reading, and by the end of the month? That's the whole country!' said a wild-eyed, energized Booker as he paced in front of Dawson, who told the New Jersey senator through a tight smile that it sounded like a great idea. 'Ever since we had to cut staff in New Hampshire, my brain's just been working overtime. I can't believe how easy it is! The trick is to get a teacher or something to email it to parents of the kids, then you're really cooking. It'd be great if a certain actress, who must know 12 people, could endorse me.' At press time, Booker was seen trying to convince Dawson to let him use her garage for an envelope-stuffing party later that week."
181,"Well Spoken, My Good Fellow, But Let Me Retort,' Says Congressman Engaged In Probing, High-Minded Debate On Facts And Merits Of Impeachment","WASHINGTON'Praising the eloquence and noble character of his Democratic colleague before humbly offering a rebuttal, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) engaged in thoughtful and enlightened debate Thursday over the merits of proposed impeachment articles brought against the president of the United States. 'Allow me first to congratulate you upon your exceptional oratory and remark upon what a great honor it is to deliberate this matter with a man of such high integrity,' said Jordan, who addressed House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) in measured and courtesy tones, commending civil discourse as the bedrock of a democratic society. 'Although you have made some very cogent and incisive rhetorical points this morning, I must, unfortunately, submit a rejoinder in which I shall seek to elucidate what I believe to be a fallacy in your position. Despite our arrival at this occasion of discord, please know I consider you a true compatriot: a fellow truth-seeker with no interest beyond securing what is best for our great republic.' At press time, witnesses confirmed Jordan had nearly beaten Nadler to death with a cane after being set off by a remark impugning the honor of the president."
182,Fox News Condemns 2020 Election As Partisan Witch Hunt Orchestrated By Democrats To Unseat President,"NEW YORK'Calling the running and nomination of a candidate a blatant abuse of power from the left, Fox News personality Tucker Carlson condemned the 2020 election Thursday as a partisan witch hunt orchestrated by Democrats to unseat President Trump. 'This is nothing more than a Soviet-style democratic election,' said Carlson, adding that the timing of the election was especially suspicious, coming after Trump has already been in office for three years. 'The millions of dollars spent on campaign ads and televised debates clearly point to some larger conspiracy being pushed by the left; it's a total coup! This poorly executed attempt to downplay the president's overwhelming electoral victory in 2016 with some sort of flimsy pretext to democracy is inexcusable and the exact type of threat our founding fathers warned us about. Frankly, it's unconstitutional and shameful to see Democrats stoop to such low levels.' At press time, Democratic candidates had announced the suspension of their campaigns saying this kind of divisiveness was not what America needs right now. "

The Onion looks at the pros and cons of social media banning political ads. Encourages candidates to exploit more traditional forms of media.  Quite clearly opposite of what Mark Zuckerberg wants. Politicians still free to post thirst traps on personal accounts. Look on Hillary Clinton's face if we started that now. All that personal data collected for nothing. Got few extra Twitter followers from dunking on Biden campaign slogan. Lack of politics is a political statement, man.

185,Trump Offers Hunter Biden Job In Energy Department Based On Oil Industry Experience,"WASHINGTON'Touting his impressive record of serving on the board of a notable natural gas company, President Donald Trump offered Hunter Biden a job in the U.S. Department of Energy Monday based on his experience in the oil industry. 'Given his unparalleled background in this sector, I am pleased to have Hunter Biden joining the Energy Department as the new Deputy Secretary for the Office of International Affairs,' said Trump, explaining that Biden's long list of contacts with major Eastern European petroleum firms would be indispensable in promoting the administration's interests as they pursue energy contracts abroad. 'Hunter grew up in politics, so he's primed for the job, and he came very highly recommended by several big-time energy executives. He's a really great guy who knows how to get things done in this business. Hunter will start tomorrow, getting right to work securing the best deals possible for the American people.' At press time, Trump nominated Hunter Biden to replace a retiring Rick Perry as energy secretary at the end of the year."
186,So-Called Ronald Reagan Presidential Library Looks Nothing Like Him,"SIMI VALLEY, CA'Declaring the whole visit 'sort of a letdown,' Valley View Middle School student Lucas Hursch, 13, was disappointed to find Monday that the so-called Ronald Reagan Presidential Library bears no resemblance to the man who was the leader of the free world from 1980 to 1988. 'You could maybe argue it has a passing resemblance from some angles, but seriously, that would be quite a stretch,' said the eighth-grader, adding that unless the 40th president had a tiny, marble version of himself inside his own body which he charged a $20 entrance fee to see, the building bearing his name shares no physical characteristics to the actor-turned-politician. 'I assumed we'd get there, enter a giant glass and steel model of Reagan's head, perhaps using The Great Communicator's tongue as a walkway, and have the chance to explore his guts and stuff. But this place has none of that' just a boring building with completely normal doors and windows. I was taught a library is where knowledge is kept, so that kind of should be up in his brain, I guess? Also, you'd think they have it dressed up in a nice suit or something, but the outside is just bricks. If they were going for realism, they did not do a great job.' Hursch noted that the architects and building contractors had no excuse for their shoddy work, as there are thousands of photographs available to aid them in constructing a more realistic replica of the president. "
187,Pete Buttigieg Blames Inability To Disclose Political Stances On NDA With Buttigieg Campaign,"CONCORD, NH'Declaring that he simply has no choice in the matter, White House hopeful Pete Buttigieg told reporters Friday that some political positions he holds cannot be disclosed because of a nondisclosure agreement he signed with the Pete Buttigieg presidential campaign. 'I would love to answer your questions, but back in early 2019, I signed a strict, binding contract with the Pete for America organization in which I agreed not to discuss such matters,' Buttigieg said during a candidate forum, explaining that while he would love to offer more detailed and convincing proposals on issues such as healthcare, foreign policy, and immigration, he is legally prohibited from doing so. 'There's nothing I'd enjoy more than elaborating on my tax plan, for example, but I can't talk about any views I may have held during the period of my candidacy. These are highly confidential policy initiatives. Unless the Buttigieg campaign agrees to release me from the NDA, I'm afraid there's simply nothing I can do.' At press time, the Buttigieg campaign was reportedly scrambling to perform damage control after details of Buttigieg's political stances had been leaked to the public."

'Look, these cuts are not about kicking people off the food stamp rolls, but encouraging them to get off the couch and start looking for thankless, backbreaking work that will be rendered obsolete by either automation or outsourcing by 2025,' said Perdue, adding that the administration's goal wasn't to prevent Americans from affording food, but to create an empowering situation where U.S. citizens could barely have the means for sustenance because their degrading, short-term job, with severe physical and emotional hazards, forces them to work overtime without extra pay. 'We are hoping the new directive will serve as a gentle nudge for Americans to take their lives into their own hands by signing up for one, two, or even three demanding jobs from a hellish megacorporation that only cares about their bottom line. People shouldn't be relying on the government for free food, especially in this current Trump economy'there are tons of available positions that will push the boundaries of their physical and mental health, as well as significantly decrease their life expectancy, all in exchange for a meager subsistence that robs them and their families of their dignity.' Perdue also added that the new rules would work in tandem with the proposed cuts to Medicare, which the administration has argued will incentivize unemployed people to take up jobs that offer inhumane health care plans that don't cover essential services."
191,Boris Johnson Worried Anti-Semitism Accusations Against Labour Party Will Hurt Tories' Hold On Bigot Vote,"LONDON'Monitoring polls and news coverage of the upcoming elections, U.K. prime minister Boris Johnson reportedly expressed concern Thursday that continued accusations of anti-Semitism against the Labour Party will hurt the Tories' hold on the bigot vote. 'Those with prejudiced and discriminatory beliefs have long been a bedrock of the Conservative Party constituency, but I'm nervous that so many people attacking Labour as the party of anti-Semites will eat into our ability to win,' said Johnson, adding that he was concerned the volume of allegations that Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn wasn't doing enough to combat anti-Semitism in his own party could result in bigoted voters believing that Labour actually represented their values. 'When allegations first started coming out, I figured it would be a flash in the pan and the Tories could continue counting on the bigot vote, as we have for generations. It's really going to hurt us if people think Labour is the party for anti-Semitism based on a few things in the media and ignore the political reality, which is that the Conservatives have for decades reliably issued policy driven by prejudice and racial animus. But it's going to be a close election, and I'm worried if this doesn't stop, the Tories could be at risk of losing the Islamaphobe or even the white supremacist vote, and that would be devastating at the polls.' An increasingly desperate Johnson added that he was pondering saying or doing something extremely anti-Semitic in order to remind bigoted voters on the fence about which party best advocated their interests."
192,Jimmy Carter Devotes Rest Of Life To Raising Awareness Of Fact That Men Get UTIs Too,"PLAINS, GA'As he continues to rest and recover following a brush with the ailment earlier this week, former President Jimmy Carter announced Thursday he would spend the remainder of his life educating people about the fact that men, too, routinely suffer from urinary tract infections. 'This isn't just an issue that affects women: Every urethra is delicate and susceptible, with roughly one in 10 men contracting a UTI at some point during their life,' said the 39th president of the United States, confirming he would immediately sever ties with Habitat for Humanity and terminate the Carter Center's long-running program to eradicate Guinea worm disease in order to focus solely on the promotion of healthy male urinary tracts. 'This painful affliction is often misdiagnosed, so if you feel a sharp burning sensation when urinating or notice an unfamiliar discharge in your urine, make sure you get tested. It's nothing to be embarrassed about, and there's no reason to live in discomfort when treatment is readily available. They give you some pills and it clears right up.' At press time, Carter was reportedly going from stall door to stall door in a public men's room, where he urged occupants to reduce their risk of a UTI by drinking plenty of fluids and keeping the tip of their penis clean and dry."

'We are going to have so much fun without you losers,' said the U.S. commander in chief of the impromptu new intergovernmental alliance he formed after proclaiming that 'the old NATO is stupid,' explaining that he had already poured billions of dollars of funding into the collective to ensure they have the 'best summit ever.' 'France and Canada think they're so cool, but we could totally destroy them in a fight. I already met with Qaboos, Stevo, and Dsi, and we're gonna get matching satin jackets and they're gonna look sick.'

'The day she locked me up for marijuana possession, I looked her in the eye and swore I would have my revenge,' said Simmons, rubbing the long scar on his head while staring into the dark, empty room around him and ruminating on how his lifelong quest to destroy Harris's presidential ambitions was finally complete. 'Fifteen years of my life gone'you took them from me Kamala, but it looks like I've had the last laugh. All those lost days in prison, plotting my return, crafting my backstory, studying you for weaknesses, I even joined the army, it's all lead to this.

'I know I don't really need a second campaign, and it hasn't even been that long since I bought my first one, but it's the holidays, and I wanted to do something special for Mikey. It's going to have a full campaign staff available around the clock, and there's even going to be a movie theater in the headquarters where we can watch all my political ads.

'It's not that the shoulder rub thing isn't creepy, it is, but we didn't realize the Pandora's box that we opened by making him stop,' said Loveland, Colorado resident Virginia Dalton, claiming that while Biden smelling a woman's hair had always grossed her out, seeing the 77-year-old biting his wife's finger during a campaign event over the weekend shook her to the core. 'It's fine, just let him do it. Unsolicited shoulder rubs or touching a stranger's lower back are not good, but at least they're kind of normal. There is apparently no hope of him just acting okay, so let's at least give him back the shoulder rubs, because God knows what horrors he will unleash upon women without that outlet.' At press time, the nation's women were hastily promising Biden they would vote for him just so they could escape his advances."
199,Pete Buttigieg Admits Only Recently Realizing Black People Can Vote,"SOUTH BEND, IN'In response to recent criticism of his campaign and political record, Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg admitted Monday that he only recently realized that black people can vote. 'I'll be the first one to acknowledge that I've had some blind spots in my political career, and I've learned some hard truths over the past few months, one of which is that African Americans have been able to vote in this country for decades,' said the mayor of South Bend, IN, apologizing to the city's black residents for his lack of attention to the problems facing their community and his belief that they didn't possess the legal right to cast a ballot for any elected office. 'In the time since I announced my campaign, my eyes have been opened to the realities of this country's systemic racism, and also black suffrage. I realize that some of the things I've done as mayor and said on the campaign trail aren't going to play as well with this constituency, although, to be fair, I've only just realized that they're a constituency. I honestly had no idea. But going forward, my message to black Americans is that I want your vote now that I know that you have one.' Buttigieg added that in order to avoid alienating potential supporters, he would be open to not letting black people vote. "

207,Pete Buttigieg Blames Inability To Disclose Political Stances On NDA With Buttigieg Campaign,"CONCORD, NH'Declaring that he simply has no choice in the matter, White House hopeful Pete Buttigieg told reporters Friday that some political positions he holds cannot be disclosed because of a nondisclosure agreement he signed with the Pete Buttigieg presidential campaign. 'I would love to answer your questions, but back in early 2019, I signed a strict, binding contract with the Pete for America organization in which I agreed not to discuss such matters,' Buttigieg said during a candidate forum, explaining that while he would love to offer more detailed and convincing proposals on issues such as healthcare, foreign policy, and immigration, he is legally prohibited from doing so. 'There's nothing I'd enjoy more than elaborating on my tax plan, for example, but I can't talk about any views I may have held during the period of my candidacy. These are highly confidential policy initiatives. Unless the Buttigieg campaign agrees to release me from the NDA, I'm afraid there's simply nothing I can do.' At press time, the Buttigieg campaign was reportedly scrambling to perform damage control after details of Buttigieg's political stances had been leaked to the public."

210,Sonny Perdue Argues Food Stamp Cuts Will Incentivize People To Get Exploitative Jobs That Won't Exist In 5 Years,"WASHINGTON'Responding to the criticism surrounding the Trump administration's recent decision to tighten restrictions on supplemental nutrition eligibility, Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue argued Thursday that the food stamp cuts will incentivize people to go out and get exploitative jobs that won't exist in five years. 'Look, these cuts are not about kicking people off the food stamp rolls, but encouraging them to get off the couch and start looking for thankless, backbreaking work that will be rendered obsolete by either automation or outsourcing by 2025,' said Perdue, adding that the administration's goal wasn't to prevent Americans from affording food, but to create an empowering situation where U.S. citizens could barely have the means for sustenance because their degrading, short-term job, with severe physical and emotional hazards, forces them to work overtime without extra pay. 'We are hoping the new directive will serve as a gentle nudge for Americans to take their lives into their own hands by signing up for one, two, or even three demanding jobs from a hellish megacorporation that only cares about their bottom line. People shouldn't be relying on the government for free food, especially in this current Trump economy'there are tons of available positions that will push the boundaries of their physical and mental health, as well as significantly decrease their life expectancy, all in exchange for a meager subsistence that robs them and their families of their dignity.' Perdue also added that the new rules would work in tandem with the proposed cuts to Medicare, which the administration has argued will incentivize unemployed people to take up jobs that offer inhumane health care plans that don't cover essential services."
211,Boris Johnson Worried Anti-Semitism Accusations Against Labour Party Will Hurt Tories' Hold On Bigot Vote,"LONDON'Monitoring polls and news coverage of the upcoming elections, U.K. prime minister Boris Johnson reportedly expressed concern Thursday that continued accusations of anti-Semitism against the Labour Party will hurt the Tories' hold on the bigot vote. 'Those with prejudiced and discriminatory beliefs have long been a bedrock of the Conservative Party constituency, but I'm nervous that so many people attacking Labour as the party of anti-Semites will eat into our ability to win,' said Johnson, adding that he was concerned the volume of allegations that Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn wasn't doing enough to combat anti-Semitism in his own party could result in bigoted voters believing that Labour actually represented their values. 'When allegations first started coming out, I figured it would be a flash in the pan and the Tories could continue counting on the bigot vote, as we have for generations. It's really going to hurt us if people think Labour is the party for anti-Semitism based on a few things in the media and ignore the political reality, which is that the Conservatives have for decades reliably issued policy driven by prejudice and racial animus. But it's going to be a close election, and I'm worried if this doesn't stop, the Tories could be at risk of losing the Islamaphobe or even the white supremacist vote, and that would be devastating at the polls.' An increasingly desperate Johnson added that he was pondering saying or doing something extremely anti-Semitic in order to remind bigoted voters on the fence about which party best advocated their interests."
212,Jimmy Carter Devotes Rest Of Life To Raising Awareness Of Fact That Men Get UTIs Too,"PLAINS, GA'As he continues to rest and recover following a brush with the ailment earlier this week, former President Jimmy Carter announced Thursday he would spend the remainder of his life educating people about the fact that men, too, routinely suffer from urinary tract infections. 'This isn't just an issue that affects women: Every urethra is delicate and susceptible, with roughly one in 10 men contracting a UTI at some point during their life,' said the 39th president of the United States, confirming he would immediately sever ties with Habitat for Humanity and terminate the Carter Center's long-running program to eradicate Guinea worm disease in order to focus solely on the promotion of healthy male urinary tracts. 'This painful affliction is often misdiagnosed, so if you feel a sharp burning sensation when urinating or notice an unfamiliar discharge in your urine, make sure you get tested. It's nothing to be embarrassed about, and there's no reason to live in discomfort when treatment is readily available. They give you some pills and it clears right up.' At press time, Carter was reportedly going from stall door to stall door in a public men's room, where he urged occupants to reduce their risk of a UTI by drinking plenty of fluids and keeping the tip of their penis clean and dry."

'We are going to have so much fun without you losers,' said the U.S. commander in chief of the impromptu new intergovernmental alliance he formed after proclaiming that 'the old NATO is stupid,' explaining that he had already poured billions of dollars of funding into the collective to ensure they have the 'best summit ever.' 'France and Canada think they're so cool, but we could totally destroy them in a fight. I already met with Qaboos, Stevo, and Dsi, and we're gonna get matching satin jackets and they're gonna look sick.'

'The day she locked me up for marijuana possession, I looked her in the eye and swore I would have my revenge,' said Simmons, rubbing the long scar on his head while staring into the dark, empty room around him and ruminating on how his lifelong quest to destroy Harris's presidential ambitions was finally complete. 'Fifteen years of my life gone'you took them from me Kamala, but it looks like I've had the last laugh. All those lost days in prison, plotting my return, crafting my backstory, studying you for weaknesses, I even joined the army, it's all lead to this. You thought you were tough, you thought you had destroyed me, but your chickens have come home to roost. He nani, Kamala.'

'Having one presidential campaign is nice and all, but I had some extra money lying around and decided to splurge on another first-class presidential campaign with all the bells and whistles,' said Bloomberg, adding that he planned to split time between his original campaign and his new luxury one, for which he'd already gotten the most expensive consultants, most luxurious campaign vehicles, and nicest website money can buy. 'I know I don't really need a second campaign, and it hasn't even been that long since I bought my first one, but it's the holidays, and I wanted to do something special for Mikey. It's going to have a full campaign staff available around the clock, and there's even going to be a movie theater in the headquarters where we can watch all my political ads. Voters are going to be blown away when they see it.' Bloomberg told reporters that he was also scouting sites for an additional international presidential campaign in a more exotic locale."
218,Nation Calls For Letting Biden Rub Women's Shoulders Again After Seeing What He'll Do Instead,"WASHINGTON'Apologizing for what they have unleashed by condemning the former Vice President's past behavior, the U.S. populace issued a call Monday to let Joe Biden rub women's shoulders again after seeing what he will do instead. 'It's not that the shoulder rub thing isn't creepy, it is, but we didn't realize the Pandora's box that we opened by making him stop,' said Loveland, Colorado resident Virginia Dalton, claiming that while Biden smelling a woman's hair had always grossed her out, seeing the 77-year-old biting his wife's finger during a campaign event over the weekend shook her to the core. 'It's fine, just let him do it. Unsolicited shoulder rubs or touching a stranger's lower back are not good, but at least they're kind of normal. There is apparently no hope of him just acting okay, so let's at least give him back the shoulder rubs, because God knows what horrors he will unleash upon women without that outlet.' At press time, the nation's women were hastily promising Biden they would vote for him just so they could escape his advances."
219,Pete Buttigieg Admits Only Recently Realizing Black People Can Vote,"SOUTH BEND, IN'In response to recent criticism of his campaign and political record, Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg admitted Monday that he only recently realized that black people can vote. 'I'll be the first one to acknowledge that I've had some blind spots in my political career, and I've learned some hard truths over the past few months, one of which is that African Americans have been able to vote in this country for decades,' said the mayor of South Bend, IN, apologizing to the city's black residents for his lack of attention to the problems facing their community and his belief that they didn't possess the legal right to cast a ballot for any elected office. 'In the time since I announced my campaign, my eyes have been opened to the realities of this country's systemic racism, and also black suffrage. I realize that some of the things I've done as mayor and said on the campaign trail aren't going to play as well with this constituency, although, to be fair, I've only just realized that they're a constituency. I honestly had no idea. But going forward, my message to black Americans is that I want your vote now that I know that you have one.' Buttigieg added that in order to avoid alienating potential supporters, he would be open to not letting black people vote. "

'What was that? Oh, sure, I could spare some change,' said Thompson, who, presuming the young Buttigieg canvasser speaking to him must represent a charity of some kind, fished into his pocket for the $1.17 worth of currency that would cause him to skyrocket to the top of the South Bend, IN mayor's list of African American contributors. 'I know that's a lot of dimes, hope that's okay. Oh, whoops, sorry about that paperclip in there! Ha, ha. No'no, I'm not interested in a pamphlet, but thanks anyway. I have to go now, all right? You have a good day.' At press time, sources confirmed Thompson was unaware his image was now prominently featured on the page of Buttigieg's website touting the candidate's plan to empower black America."

'You can do this, just think pious thoughts and you'll be halfway to Heaven long before they can uncover anything else,' said Pence, tightly clenching his hands in prayer while bobbing up and down on the balls of his feet in a reported attempt to jump-start the salvation process. 'Okay, here we go.

The criminal computer system that was solely responsible for fabricating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election was reportedly chuckling to itself, remembering how it had duped everyone by spending months under an assumed identity as a Pentium Pro in Morocco, as beautiful, scantily clad women fanned it with palm leaves and massaged its circuits with the finest cotton swabs. At press time, the grinning server had stood up from its beach chair to embrace its old friend Hillary Clinton as she stepped onto the deck."

'It would have been nice if someone from the Buttigieg team had reached out to me before they plastered my face all over these mailers,' said Booker, flipping through a brochure featuring numerous photos of the New Jersey senator giving a thumbs-up and shaking hands with Buttigieg. 'I like Pete fine and everything, and we've gotten to know each other a bit on the campaign trail, but we're certainly not as close as these flyers make it seem. In any case, I do worry that seeing my picture scores of times under headings like, 'It's time for a new generation of American leadership,' could send the wrong message about who I'm supporting in the primary.'

231,Biggest Revelations From The Anonymous Trump Official's New Book,"A Warning, the new book by an anonymous writer identified as 'a senior Trump administration official' that purports to be a critical look at the Donald Trump presidency, was published November 19. The Onion takes a look at the biggest revelations from the anonymous official's new book. Trump fails to hide his character weaknesses and lack of intellectual acumen as adeptly as past presidents. Several senior administration officials considered resigning en masse in 2018 to protest Trump's behavior, but decided to wait for a time when it also wouldn't make a difference. The White House has only one bathroom. Frequent unrelated asides explaining how it's a good idea for the U.S. to go to war with Iran. Trump's animosity toward the Federal Reserve stems from a fundamental disagreement over the nature of monetary policy, as his own research into the new classical model confirms a hypothesis that business growth is not substantially affected by central bank activity. One time the author saw two Barrons playing cards with each other. GOP officials are willing to replace Trump as 2020 candidate if it ever seems like the Democrats are serious about competing. The main reason Trump's critics have been unable to persuade his supporters to abandon him is because they haven't quoted Cicero enough. Print still pretty profitable if you know how to play your cards right. Stephen Miller meets with Dracula in the confusing epilogue setting up the sequel."

'Whether you're more of a centrist white person or a fiscally conservative one, all whites have a home in the Buttigieg campaign. You can rest assured knowing that we've received no endorsement from the NAACP or any minority organizations. For the most part, black voters don't even know who I am.

'President Trump and his allies conducted a smear campaign against me knowing I would refuse to participate in advancing illegal activities on their behalf, though I totally understand if you don't give a shit because that's just the way things work now and nothing matters,' said Yovanovitch, who stated that while she found Trump's actions 'shocking' and 'unprecedented,' lawmakers were free to cut her off at any time so that they could all go back to wallowing in the sense of meaninglessness that has come to permeate American life. 'This has never really happened in the history of the modern presidency, but I can sympathize if you're shrugging it off'I'm shrugging it off, too. Even if we do prove the president is guilty of high crimes, so what? It's not like there are rules anymore. Frankly, I was surprised that I was called to testify at all.'

According to the released call logs, President Trump responded to Zelensky's appeals for further cooperation between the two countries by hitting nine and then star 30 times in a row while yelling 'Ukraine!' into the phone. This was reportedly followed by an eight-minute exchange where the president repeatedly held down the entire keypad in an attempt to hang up the phone. In addition, several pages of the transcript document noted rapid fire dialing as Trump muttered about not knowing how to spell Ukraine with numbers. At press time, legal analysts going over the call were expressing the most interest in the final five minutes, where President Trump attempts to order a meat lovers pizza and cinnamon sticks from Domino's before launching into a six-minute diatribe about how someone with President Zelensky's thick accent shouldn't be working at a pizza place."

'We hope the masterminds behind the hearing have some real surprises in store, otherwise I don't see this ever perking up to three or four Andrew Johnsons,' said Jennings, noting that audiences who tuned in to the congressional proceedings looking for a thriller would find themselves facing more of a plodding slice-of-life drama. 'They had the perfect opportunity in the third hour for a dramatic moment, but they totally blew it. If someone had produced a phone in a Ziploc bag, we would have bumped our rating up half of a Johnson for sure; however, it looks like the creators weren't interested in taking risks. Frankly, if it weren't for the costume designers behind George Kent's bowtie, we wouldn't have given the hearing any Andrew Johnsons at all.

'We're proud to announce that we have reached a debt-based deal with the Buttigieg campaign to bring their considerable war chest and great polling numbers into our fold,' said campaign spokesman Greg Ryans, adding that the reported $250 million buyout 'perfectly aligned' with the Patrick campaign's vision of attaining high polling in early caucus states, rapidly accelerating grassroots organization, and widening its donation base before the end of Q4. 'Sadly, we did have to lay off 30% of the Buttigieg campaign due to redundancies, including Pete himself. But we were impressed enough to keep on Chasten Buttigieg in his current role at campaign rallies. With the assets from liquidating Amy Klobuchar's campaign, we're easily on track to be a presidential frontrunner by early 2020.' Ryans also noted that the Patrick campaign would strategically shed the gay rights plank of Buttigieg's platforms after it proved distasteful to potential campaign investors."

'Remember, it's not a real woman. It's just a piece of metal like any other doorknob. Just take a deep breath and don't throw up.'

The Onion provides tips for testifying to Congress. Don't be too eager to say yes to the first congressional hearing you're asked to speak at'it's better if you wait for the right one to come along. Start off with a light joke, like 'Is this water, or truth serum?' A calm, respectful demeanor is absolutely crucial unless you're a Supreme Court nominee. Remember, you only get three 'passes' during questioning. Iowa congresswoman Abby Finkenauer is going to carve you up. Nothing you can do about it. Do not be the chairman and CEO of Facebook. Have some pieces of deli meat in your pocket to keep your energy up. Tell the truth unless someone who can pardon you wants you to lie. While it is the congressman's job to flirt with you, it doesn't mean they actually like you. No matter what happens, take solace that Congress never actually doles out consequences."

'Despite the escalation of the inquiry in recent weeks, impeachment has the backing of less than 1% of people who have never encountered Western-style democracy and live in small, remote tribes hidden deep in the rainforest,' said Reuters poll analyst Chris Kahn, explaining that a month of depositions 'hasn't moved the needle at all' among indigenous hunter-gatherers entirely unfamiliar with our nation, its leaders, and its constitutional precedents. 'This is a huge problem for Democrats. Go into these totally isolated communities that exhibit only a loose form of what we would call political structure, and you won't find anyone demanding impeachment. Talk to individuals who possess no concept of a social contract in which the state exists solely to serve the will of the people, and none of them will tell you Donald Trump should be removed from office. It's that simple.' Kahn went on to remark that if Democrats wanted these numbers to change, they would have to begin by reaching out to people and presenting them with evidence that the United States exists."

Remember, abortion's bad, corporations are good, and as for everything else, you just shut the fuck up and do as your told. Got it?' At press time, after the valet nervously informed McConnell that he was hungover and had illegal drugs in his system, the laughing Senate leader assured him that wouldn't be an issue."
252,"Oh Jesus, Now What?' Says Exhausted Trump Turning On News To See What Bullshit Thing President Did Today","WASHINGTON'Bemoaning the never-ending stream of news about the current occupant of the Oval Office, an exhausted President Donald Trump reportedly asked himself, 'Oh Jesus, now what?' after turning the TV Wednesday and seeing what bullshit thing the president had done this time. 'Just a single day without this garbage would be nice, but with this administration, there's always something, isn't there?' said Trump, who groaned that everywhere he looked'the television, the newspaper, even his Twitter feed'he was confronted with yet another fucking insane story about the president. 'No matter how hard I try, I can't seem to escape that asshole. Every day I ask myself, 'When will it all end?' Because it's seriously becoming more than I can handle.' At press time, Trump was overheard mumbling to himself that with his luck, he'll probably wind up having to put up with this horseshit for another four years."
253,Vindman Says Ukraine Transcript Left Out Lengthy Sections Of Trump Bragging About Time He Was In Pizza Hut Commercial,"WASHINGTON'Raising further questions about Donald Trump's July call to Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky, national security expert Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman testified Tuesday that the White House's transcript of the conversation left out lengthy sections of Trump bragging about the time he was in a commercial for Pizza Hut. 'When I saw there were numerous gaps in the official record of the call, I sought to add in the president's lengthy explanation about how professional the production team had been and how some of the most classic moments in the ad were actually lines that he had improvised on set, but I was ultimately rebuffed,' said Vindman, telling House impeachment investigators that several ellipses in the call summary covered remarks about how Trump was a major force in making the stuffed-crust pizza one of America's most popular fast food items, and that people still regularly approach him to compliment his acting skills in the ad. 'I did not think it was proper for the president to ask another country's leader to queue up a YouTube video of the advertisement so he could walk him through it moment by moment. In addition, while it is not reflected in the call summary, there was an explicit mention by Zelensky about the palpable chemistry the president had with Ivana Trump, even while they were in the midst of a divorce.' Vindman also testified that the transcript had been stored in a top-secret computer system along with records of other communications with foreign leaders, including a phone call with Chinese president Xi Jinping in which Trump spoke for over an hour about meeting Grimace during a 2002 McDonald's commercial.

255,"Bernie Sanders Holds Secret Campaign Meeting With 15,000 Working-Class Democratic Donors","DETROIT'Releasing bombshell evidence in the form of hundreds of cell phone videos taken during the gathering, numerous anonymous tipsters confirmed this week that Bernie Sanders recently attended a secret campaign meeting with 15,000 working-class donors from the Democratic Party. 'This damning footage shows Sen. Sanders clandestinely mingling with thousands of representatives from the nursing, food service, and public education sectors, many of whom were apparently chauffeured to the event aboard city buses and enjoyed fountain drinks upon arriving,' said political strategist August Buckminster, adding that the event, which reportedly took place at a local vocational school, could prove problematic for the presidential candidate in his bid for the Democratic nomination. 'Sanders can be heard promising a highly underprivileged audience everything from a minimum-wage increase to healthcare access to educational opportunities'whatever it takes to get them on his side. In one video, he explicitly offers a group of steel workers a quid pro quo of affordable housing in exchange for their votes. If the senator wants to win the backing of the national party, he will certainly have to answer for hobnobbing with this room full of people at the absolute lowest levels of power.' At press time, Sanders had received further criticism after documents were uncovered showing he has acted on behalf of a contingent of approximately 625,000 Vermont residents over a period of nearly 30 years."

'Show me one more time! One more time, please?' said a visibly gleeful Trump, who according to sources became sullen, pounded on his desk, and threw a paperweight at acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney when the adviser gently suggested it was time to move on to other items on the president's daily agenda. 'I'm not going to any stupid meetings. I want to watch my show again. I love it, I love it, I love it! Fast-forward to the part with the big boom!' At press time, reports confirmed Trump was demanding that Pentagon officials make more videos of people dying for him to watch."

'Why would they do that? It's so mean,' said Trump, adding that when they stood up in their box seats to wave, the crowd began viciously booing Melania, an act he claimed was extremely disrespectful to the office of the first lady, especially since he was pretty sure she hadn't done anything illegal. 'Listen, there are plenty of things about Melania that I don't like. I've definitely thought about replacing her. Heck, I got caught up in the chant for a little bit there too. But she should be able to attend a baseball game in peace. Someone even pulled out a sign that said 'Impeach Trump,' which is silly, because I don't think she can be impeached. Overall, we were incredibly embarrassed for Melania, but she was able to put on a brave face. I went over to console her and she didn't seem bothered by it at all.' At press time, Trump kicked himself for being foolish after realizing that the crowd was probably booing Senator David Perdue (R-GA) for his unpopular agricultural policies."

Lindsey Graham (R-SC) into their meeting Friday after it became clear he had come to storm the room all by himself. 'We figured it wouldn't hurt to let just one more person in, and to be honest, we all felt pretty bad for the sad sack,' said House Foreign Affairs Committee chair Eliot Engel, who added that aides had spotted the lone senator outside the Capitol's Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility struggling to set up a Facebook livestream and checking the batteries in a bullhorn he couldn't get to work. 'You could hear him out there rehearsing his little speech to himself over and over right before he ran up and knocked on the door. When we opened it, he started sputtering and sweating and couldn't get any words out, so after a while [Rep.] Ted [Deutch] just said, 'Hey, Lindsey, you can come in. It's fine.' He sat down and mumbled something about how three or four other Republicans had told him they might be showing up later to join his protest, but no one ever did.' According to sources, Graham later announced he had more important places to be and accidentally exited through the wrong door, finding himself in a broom closet where, to avoid further embarrassment, he stayed quiet and perfectly still through the remaining six hours of the hearing."

'Come on, guys, wasn't that fun when I got in that really huge truck or did that photo op with the taco bowl?' said the 45th commander in chief of the halcyon days when he was attacked by a bald eagle, insulted the appearance of Ted Cruz's wife, or threw paper towels to Puerto Rico rescue workers, spiraling into an ever-deeper panic as he realized the gravity of the investigation into his diplomatic misdeeds in Ukraine. 'I feel like everybody is just focusing on the negative here. Don't forget, we've had a lot of great laughs together, like when that lawn mower kid came to the White House or when I looked up at a solar eclipse without the glasses. Boy, wasn't that a real hoot? I mean, how can you not remember the fast food banquet, or when my butt looked big in that one picture? Doesn't that count for anything? That was classic Trump.' At press time, the American public sighed deeply in fond remembrance of all the good times they'd shared together as support for impeachment dropped to 0%."

'On the one hand, there is just too much bird seed missing each morning to be attributable to birds alone, and on the other, there are a few suspicious squirrels who have been skulking around the yard lately'I think there's some collusion afoot, but right now, it's impossible to prove,' said the unshaven former FBI director, showing reporters how he had propped up several camcorders on his windowsill to film the squirrels when he wasn't watching the animals through binoculars from under a canoe he'd flipped over in the corner of his yard. 'I thought I had them the other night when the automatic light went on beside the garage, but by the time I got down there, the birdseed was gone. I followed the trail for a while, but it was raining and I lost the scent. There was a late-night meeting a few days ago between a possum and a raccoon I think might be germane to the case, but I don't want to leap to any conclusions. I haven't seen the raccoon interact with the squirrels yet, which makes me think there's some go-between critter I haven't identified. It's a big question mark on the board I've got inside. They're wily'they're trying to play 12-step chess. Fortunately, though, I've got some experience playing that game. And I've got all the time in the world ever since I cleared up that inquiry into why the begonias kept getting trampled and also since my wife left me.' At press time, a frantic, wild-eyed Mueller had burst into FBI headquarters and demanded someone help him file a subpoena to get access to the inside of a tree where he suspected the squirrels were storing the stolen birdseed."

'The U.S. has turned against me, so it's time for me to float off to some distant land,' said the president, crouching next to a balustrade on the White House roof and blowing air into balloon after balloon. 'All right, Mick [Mulvaney], time for you to jump out the window to lighten the load. Just a few thousand more and I'll be aloft. If the wind holds, I should make it to Saudi Arabia by morning. Farewell! On to my next great adventure!' At press time, dozens of House GOP members were holding a press conference outside the White House to describe how beautiful and majestic the president looked flying through the air. "

'Right now, it's an all-Democratic casket. Not even the press are allowed inside. We've been knocking all morning and have yet to receive a response, those cowards!'

'Everyone's getting on his case all the time'Goofus has been treated very, very unfairly,' said Trump, decrying the 60-year-old children's magazine's obvious pro-Gallant agenda while praising Goofus as a bright kid smart enough to look out for number one and who knew how to cut a deal. ''Gross Gallant' is no angel either! I hear he's in bed with some pretty shady figures, I won't say who. Too bad for Highlights, a once-great publication that has gone downhill in recent years. Unfair that they never publish your drawings when you submit them. Also, I looked at that scene of the kids playing, and the second picture? No differences! None at all! And I was in that terrible maze for hours. Not good. There was clearly no exit.' At press time, Trump had reversed his position and instructed an aide to renew the White House's subscription after discovering Highlights gave him some positive press by mentioning him in a list of U.S. presidents."
268,Secret Service Opens Fire On Section Of Slippery Floor That Attempted To Take Out President Carter,"PLAINS, GA'Responding with deadly force to a threat that left the 39th president of the United States in the hospital, Secret Service agents confirmed they opened fire Monday evening on an expanse of slippery flooring that had made an attempt on the life of Jimmy Carter in his own home. 'It's unclear how a hostile patch of slick tile managed to get so close to President Carter, but upon identifying the wet spot that caused him to fall, we immediately began shooting,' said agent Joseph Pena, who according to federal officials put his own safety on the line, heroically throwing himself atop what appeared to be a juice spill to prevent it from doing any more harm to the 95-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner. 'In the heat of the altercation, there were unfortunately some casualties, with an innocent table lamp lost after taking friendly fire. We are proud to report, however, that the tile that wounded President Carter has been permanently neutralized and no longer poses any danger.' In response to the incident, the Secret Service has reportedly added personnel to Carter's security detail, assigning separate agents to individually patrol every surface of the former president's home."
269,Trump Apologizes For Impeachment Comment After Learning Disturbing History Of 1918 Lynching Of German American Immigrant Robert Prager,"WASHINGTON'Acknowledging the hurt he had caused, President Donald Trump apologized Tuesday for describing the House impeachment inquiry as a 'lynching,' saying he had been unaware of the term's association with the 1918 murder of Robert Prager, a German American immigrant killed by an angry mob. 'I realize now my remark was insensitive, and insulting to the memory of Mr. Prager and those impacted by his tragic death,' said the president, who asked the American people to forgive him, emphasizing how disturbed he had been when a member of his staff told him how Prager had been singled out and killed by coal miners in Illinois during a wartime wave of anti-German sentiment. 'Upon learning of this foul act, I have come to understand that lynching represents a deeply troubling chapter in our nation's past. Going forward, we must make a greater effort to reckon with this difficult part of our history, by which I mean specifically the terrible fate that befell an innocent German man on April 5, 1918. I am truly sorry for any pain my statement may have caused the German American community.' At press time, sources confirmed Trump's base appeared satisfied with his apology and had no objections to a new tweet in which he compared the impeachment inquiry to 'the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.'"

'I like Tulsi, but when we talk, everything's all about her, as if she's the only person in the world with problems,' said Assad, adding that it would be nice if once in a while Rep. Gabbard asked how his family or his 8-year-old civil war was going instead of whining about how she continues to trail Sen. Kamala Harris in New Hampshire. 'Now there's this whole thing with Hillary Clinton, and believe me, I've had my own problems with Hillary, but you don't hear me droning on and on about her all the time. At least when [Russian President Vladimir] Putin or [Iran's Supreme Leader Ali] Khamenei call, they ask me how I've been. Tulsi, meanwhile, begins every other sentence with 'When I'm president,' and I don't know how to tell her that's just not something that's going to happen for her.' At press time, sources confirmed Assad had put Gabbard on speaker so he could sign off on a few sarin gas attacks while occasionally punctuating the conversation with 'Totally' or 'Wow, that's crazy.'"

Wednesday before jumping towards a chandelier and immediately falling three stories onto the floor below. 'Good luck catching me as I disappear like a ghost in the wind'ha, ha, you can't catch someone who never existed!

'Early on, I thought it was definitely going to be Biden, but a lot of other candidates made great points about why they needed to be killed to save America, so I was really torn,' said Brimhall, who claimed hearing Bernie Sanders' arguments for universal healthcare put him at the top of his list for a few months. 'I was actually flirting with Andrew Yang for a bit'his freedom dividend seems like exactly the kind of idea I need to cleanse from the face of the Earth, but there wasn't much beyond that. I'm honestly leaning towards Warren now. She has a lot of proposals, and her fire during the debate really stood out as something I would want to destroy. Plus, I like that she's a woman.' Brimhall added that we would probably hold off making his final decision until after President Trump singles one out as an enemy of America."

'I've spent 50 years worrying about money, but now I realize that fair wages and housing are not really important'it's people and relationships, it's living in this moment right now,' said Sanders, who admitted that recovering from his surgery provided an opportunity to think about how true wealth and power does not come from money; it comes from having a devoted family. 'I encourage my supporters to forget about all that nonsense about income inequality. I was all 'jobs, jobs, jobs.' Why was I so obsessed with work and material wellbeing? I wanted a wealth tax, but you can't put a dollar value on a sunset. Money for college won't buy you a baby's smile.

'I mean, seriously? It's a few weeks before Halloween and no one even thought to dress up as the Wolfman or something? It's not like I was taking this costume seriously, but Jesus Christ, I just thought it'd be a nice way for everyone to lighten the mood. Shit. I must look like a complete idiot up here.'

'When I received a position in the Biden family, I was obviously afforded a great deal of power and opportunity, and all that opulence got the better of me. When you're in that deep, sometimes you don't see how bad things really are. I understand that I'm under more scrutiny that most people, and to be publicly involved with the Biden family gives the appearance that I've done things the American people wouldn't approve of. I take full responsibility for my involvement with the Bidens, and I'm sorry.' Hunter added that he sought to rise above any further scrutiny by announcing that he was stepping down from the Biden family"

'This is the way Americans were meant to live,' President Trump reportedly said as he looked out across the isolated encampment and used tactical hand signals to communicate with his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, who manned a sniper post in a nearby pine tree. 'As a sovereign citizen, I am not subject to government authority, and it is only here in these hills that I can truly be free. We generate our own electricity, and my aides set up this whole system for collecting and purifying water.

286,Timeline Of The GOP's Relationship With Trump,"The initiation of impeachment proceedings by House Democrats has renewed calls for more Republican leaders to publicly stand up to Trump, as well as driven his most vocal supporters to double down, amid what has been a turbulent relationship between Trump and the party he leads. The Onion looks back at the timeline of Trump and the GOP since he declared his presidential candidacy. GOP thinks it's pretty neat the way Trump attacks President Obama and questions his birth certificate and status as an American. RNC chair Reince Priebus forces then-candidate Trump to sign loyalty pledge, firmly cementing the power dynamic in their relationship. An open letter from 120 conservative foreign policy and national security leaders condemns Trump as fundamentally dishonest and the ideal candidate for the presidency. Speaking at the Republican National Convention, Senator Ted Cruz urges conservatives to 'vote their conscience,' which they do. Trump's election causes GOP leaders' worst impulses to be realized. President Trump feels disrespected after Senator John McCain chooses to die in a hospital instead of any one of the many beautiful Trump hotels and resorts. Senator Mitt Romney criticizes Trump's national emergency on the border in an effort to remind Americans that he still exists. Former Congressman Joe Walsh announces run for 2020 GOP nomination, vowing to bring the right kind of anti-Muslim rhetoric back to the White House. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announces impeachment inquiry against Trump, and GOP lawmakers fully stand by whatever scenario will keep them in office. In a stunning rebuke, Senator Marco Rubio sighs deeply before explaining how this is all perfectly normal."

Devin Nunes (R-CA) reportedly took a moment Wednesday to reflect that at least the Twitter users he was suing for mocking him didn't know about his leaking, prolapsed anus. 'These people were really mean to me when they were just critiquing my public statements and voting record, so I can just imagine the sort of field day they'd be having if they found out that my rectum is telescoped out past my anus, resulting in a constant flow of fecal matter dribbling down my leg at all times,' thought the congressman, acknowledging that if social media users discovered that he had previously worn a diaper but had stopped because it only ended up overflowing in a matter of hours, he'd likely never hear the end of it. 'To be honest, I'm also pretty fortunate that no one has sussed out the fact that the only way for me to achieve sexual satisfaction is to ejaculate into a bowl of clam chowder and feed it to an unwitting victim while filming the whole thing. That would be mighty embarrassing, to say nothing of me owning the country's largest collection of frozen condoms full of shit. And the worst part is, I'd have no legal standing to sue if any of this came out since all of this is 100% the God's honest truth.'

Commemorating Their Deaths,"WASHINGTON'Amid backlash for abandoning an ally that has been crucial in the fight against ISIS, President Donald Trump assured the Kurds Wednesday that there will one day be a very nice tree planted in Washington, D.C. commemorating their deaths. 'Our Kurdish allies should rest assured that, despite the fact that U.S. troops will no longer provide them with military support, at some point in the future there will be a very good tree with branches, leaves, and bark memorializing their untimely and very brutal demise,' said Trump, promising that even if there wasn't a plaque or anything denoting that the tree was intended as a tribute to the slaughter of Kurdish fighters and civilians, visitors would probably leave 'flowers or little stuffed bears' to let others know that it was a sad tree. 'You have my firm commitment that in 30 or 40 years, any tourist who happens to stumble upon the tree in a small park off K Street might think about how you were massacred for a second or two. And even if we forget which tree is actually the Kurd Tree, trust me when I say that it will be there somewhere.' At press time, Trump had given Turkey latitude to launch air strikes on the Kurd Tree if they felt it necessary for their national interest."

292,GOP Lawmakers Watch Silently As Trump Strangles Each Of Their Loved Ones In Turn,"WASHINGTON'Opting to take more of a wait-and-see approach instead of rushing to pass judgment, Republican lawmakers reportedly looked on in silence Tuesday as President Trump worked his way through each of their families and, one by one, strangled all their loved ones to death. 'After I watched the president slowly and methodically squeeze the life out of my wife's body as she gasped, futilely, for breath, he gave me his personal assurance that he was not responsible for her death, so I continue to stand by this administration,' said Rep. Scott DesJarlais (R-TN), who along with every Republican in both the House and Senate stated that while killing off their families in cold blood might not be entirely proper, it was certainly not an impeachable offense, no matter how the media tried to spin it. 'Now, this is not an action I would have taken myself. I personally would not have wrapped my hands around my 5-year-old son's neck and crushed his windpipe. But if Donald Trump's approach to governing is sometimes a bit outside the ordinary, that's because Donald Trump is no ordinary president. And maybe that's not such a bad thing.' Later, with his beloved sister's face turning purple as the commander-in-chief asphyxiated her with a length of barbed wire, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) appeared on several television news networks and said impeaching the president for her imminent death would be 'insane.'"
293,Trump Cabinet Officials Resentful Of Increasing Power Wielded By Live-In Caregiver,"WASHINGTON'Increasingly concerned about the sway the woman exerted over the commander in chief, Trump cabinet officials have reportedly grown resentful of the power wielded by live-in caregiver Isabella Velazquez, 45, White House sources confirmed Monday. 'Don't get me wrong, it was great when she was just around to help feed the president or wipe his face clean before press scrums, but there's something wrong about Isabella insisting she always be there to hand-deliver his intelligence reports or listen in on calls with foreign dignitaries,' said Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt, expressing his deep frustration with a recent incident in which the middle-aged nurse abruptly cut off a joint chiefs of staff meeting in order to wheel Trump into the Lincoln Bedroom for his daily nap. 'She's constantly by his side. And with things like this Syria troop withdrawal, she snaps at anyone who questions whether this policy is coming from her or the president. At this point, if an official even asks about the president's pill regimen, they're out. Christ, why do you think Bolton's gone?' Several White House officials went on to cast doubt about whether Trump had truly given Velazquez the Presidential Medal of Honor or if she simply found it while tidying up the Oval Office."
294,Trump Furiously Searching Raytheon Catalog For Gift After Realizing He Promised China And Ukraine Same Javelin Missile,"WASHINGTON'Scanning for discounts in the precision weapon and early warning satellite sections, a visibly distressed President Trump reportedly flipped through the Raytheon catalog in a panic Friday after realizing he had accidentally promised China and Ukraine the same FGM-148 Javelin missile. 'Shit, shit, shit'when I offered that rocket launcher to Xi [Jinping] I totally forgot I'd already told [Volodymyr] Zelensky he could have it,' said Trump, who was overheard muttering to himself that he could just tell the Chinese president the Javelins were out of stock, but then Xi would be upset once he found out the Ukrainians had managed to get one. 'Maybe I'll get China a Patriot, instead? No, that's too much. I don't want to seem desperate. And the Sparrow is so pass at this point, they wouldn't even want that. Damn it, I need to get something for Australia, too, don't I?' At press time, sources confirmed Trump had given up and decided to send all the countries willing to assist in his reelection campaign a $400 million Raytheon gift card so they could just pick out what they wanted."

'Most of the time I have a pretty thick skin, but if I do start getting down on myself, I just let my thoughts go back to that fateful morning and how it forever changed my life for the better,' Giuliani told reporters as he looked wistfully out his office window and recalled his 'heyday,' when he spent months basking in the praise of a nation and carefully leveraged his newfound influence to make himself a multimillionaire. 'That's where I find my strength. Anytime I need a little pick-me-up, all I need to do is look at a picture of Ground Zero and I'm right as rain. Do I wish I could go back and relive that day? Of course. But we can't go back, can we?' Giuliani then reportedly set aside the congressional subpoena he had been reading through and spent the next several hours rewatching CNN's live coverage of the second plane slamming into the World Trade Center."
296,Kamala Harris Undergoes Heart Surgery After Seeing Positive Reception For Sanders,"WASHINGTON'Calling the procedure an 'absolute necessity' to save her campaign, sources confirmed Thursday that Kamala Harris was rushed into emergency heart surgery immediately after seeing the positive reception Bernie Sanders received. 'After seeing a sudden surge in thoughts, prayers, and monetary donations received by the Sanders 2020 campaign, Mrs. Harris was rushed into the operating room where doctors promptly inserted stents into several of her arteries,' said campaign manager Juan Rodriguez, adding that although she'd only been awake for a few hours, the surgery had already allowed the Democratic candidate to gain four points in the polls and grace the front page of every major national newspaper. 'While the procedure was admittedly a shock to many, Mrs. Harris's family and friends have thankfully reported that she's already feeling 10 times more presidential. And to anyone who doubts her fitness for office, remember: Unlike Bernie, Kamala's heart was never blocked in the first place.' At press time, Harris had reportedly surpassed Sanders, Warren, and Biden in popularity after contracting a deadly form of MRSA during her recovery."
297,"Please Guide Me In My Darkest Hour Lord,' Prays Trump Kneeling Before Portrait Of Himself","WASHINGTON'Lighting candles at the altar before lowering his head in reverence, President Donald Trump prayed for the lord to guide him in his darkest hour Thursday while kneeling before a portrait of himself. 'You, the all-seeing, all-knowing, he who stands above all other beings, in my time of need, please show me the way,' said Trump, gazing into the eyes of his portrait and asking for the kind of strength that can only be granted by the almighty himself. 'Eternal one, king of kings, I have always served you dutifully and have never forsaken the quest for your glory. In all your omnipotence, I beg that you shine a light and show me how to strike down your enemies. If delivered from this trial, I will spread your word to the ends of the Earth and make sure all of humanity sings your praises.' Trump concluded the prayer by saying he would gladly offer up his children in holy sacrifice for his lord if it would secure his glory."
298,Justin Trudeau Explains Deep Spiritual Significance Of Oil Pipelines Through Indigenous Lands,"EDMONTON, CANADA'Responding to criticism of the Trans Mountain oil pipeline during a visit to Alberta, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau told reporters Thursday that pumping nearly a million barrels of oil a day through indigenous lands would be a ritual of deep spiritual significance to his people. 'These pipes are a sacred tradition handed down by my ancestors, a reminder of our connection to the land and the riches it can provide,' said Trudeau, who described his participation in age-old rites in which his family and friends would prostrate themselves before pipelines, praying for the safe passage of the petroleum within. 'Just as the smokestack rises from the ground, so too must the pipe go beneath the earth. The Creator has imbued the sands of this province with great bounty, and with the proper offerings of oil company subsidies and construction grants, we may be so blessed as to profit from its gifts.' At press time, Trudeau had concluded his remarks by inviting members of the press to join him in a traditional pipeline-blessing ceremony, beginning with the ritual application of refined black oil all over one's face and body."

'I'm not sure why the left-wing media and Democrats are so obsessed with the fact that I was on the Ukraine call when anyone in America can join simply by dialing 9'just remember to hit the pound key afterward and it should take you right in,' said Pompeo, further clarifying that while service was a little bit spotty in Alaska and some remote areas in the western states, any U.S. resident with a phone could otherwise access every Trump administration call at any time. 'Whenever you want to listen to what Trump's up to, just hit the 9 key. If the line fills up after the first million people, just press 8 and it'll take you to a different teleconferencing room. I thought everyone knew about the free administration phone line. We just ask that you stay on mute unless you have something meaningful to add, since it can get kind of chaotic in there. Heck, I was listening in on Trump's calls with foreign leaders from day one of his administration, way before I was secretary of state. You can learn all kinds of things. And don't worry, you can listen in from outside the country too'you just need your three-digit country code, although data rates may apply.' At press time, Pompeo was kicking back after dialing 9 and being immediately added to a call in which Trump was trying to convince French president Emmanuel Macron to back a potential military action against Iran."

'Well, well, well, Mr. Janitor, good luck keeping secrets from our awesome dad now that you've taken a sip of our super-powerful CIA brain juice,' said Eric Trump, prompting Don Jr. to give the White House employee some more of the 'truth sermon [sic],' which included a mixture of Diet Coke, Fanta, Sprite, Powerade, Minute Maid, and Mr. Pibb, after the custodian refused to talk. 'Who was it, toilet man? Was it one of our daddy's friends? Or was it a pretty spy lady? Or was it you the whole time who whistleblew [sic] our dad all over the TV just for being the bestest president in the whole wide world?' At press time, Eric had reportedly begun to hyperventilate after accidentally taking a sip of the 30-ounce soda cup, letting out a huge burp, and realizing that he might have been the whistleblower the whole time."
303,Bernie Sanders Unveils Plan To Tackle Income Inequality With Art Heist From Billionaire's Home,"LAS VEGAS'Championing his new policy proposal as a way to reduce the gap between the working class and the 1%, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders unveiled a comprehensive plan Tuesday to tackle income inequality with an art heist from a billionaire's home. 'We should not be living in a country where all the wealth is concentrated in a few very rich people, which is why my new plan to remove artworks from an ultrawealthy estate in the dead of night and sell them through third parties will redistribute hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of Pollocks, de Koonings, and Rothkos to the hardworking American people,' said Sanders of the detailed 85-page plan outlining his system to lift expensive paintings, sculptures, jewels, and other artworks from billionaires' private collections in their homes in the Hamptons, Upper East Side, and Palo Alto. 'Million-dollar impressionist paintings and modernist sculptures should be a public good, not kept locked up in some CEO's mansion. Using a progressive seizure rate that takes the most art from the wealthiest individuals, my plan will go a long way toward shrinking the gap between the haves and have-nots in this country. It describes in great detail how I will put the suction cups on my hands and climb to the window, then use one of those circular cutters to remove a pane of glass from the ceiling in order to place my grappling hook to rappel down. My plan also calls for building a diverse working-class coalition of Americans to put on cable-repairman clothes, gain entry to the house, disable the alarm system to access complicated private safes in under 30 seconds, and then wait outside in a requisitioned UPS delivery truck for a quick escape. Under my proposal, we'll be able to offload the stolen Monets, Picassos, and Warhols to pay for free college for all Americans.' At press time, the media was criticizing Sanders' proposal by questioning how the candidate intended to pay for all the black ski masks, razor blades for cutting paintings out of their frames, and getaway vans described in his plan."
304,Trump Aides Investigating Whistleblower Struggling To Identify Single Person In CIA With Moral Principles,"WASHINGTON'Explaining that they faced a serious roadblock in their effort to unmask the source of a leaked complaint about the president's conversations with Ukraine, aides to Donald Trump investigating a whistleblower reported to be a CIA agent were struggling Monday to identify a single person in the agency with moral principles. 'After we learned that the whistleblower is CIA, we figured it would be pretty quick to narrow down his identity among the few people there with a moral compass, but the more we looked into it, we realized we can't think of anybody who has one,' said Stephen Miller, adding that aides had cleared everyone with links to the intelligence community they knew had knowledge of Trump's Ukraine conversations due to the fact that they were all too unethical and black-hearted to care about any presidential misconduct. 'Naturally, we started at the top, but obviously [CIA director Gina] Haspel is cleared because of the whole torture thing, and all the other leading officials are into really shady shit too. Pretty much anyone who's been there longer than a year or two is out, and honestly, you don't even expect people who have any deeply held sense of right and wrong to make it past the application process. There was one guy we were pretty sure was the whistleblower, but then we looked into him and saw that he was involved in the [2009] Honduras coup. You think a guy with no scruples like that is really going to stick his neck on the line for the nation? It's hard, since this whole situation is completely antithetical to everything the CIA stands for.' Several Trump aides confirmed they were hoping to enter the whistleblower's mindset by developing any shred of moral principle themselves."

'Americans recognize that what this anonymous whistleblower did was both courageous and patriotic, so I'm sure to be commended for releasing a report on interference in the 2016 election, right? I was ahead of my time, really. I'm not saying there will be a parade in my honor, but I sure wouldn't be surprised. I'll be out of here in a day or two, and then, who knows?

'He's being so brave standing up for his country and resisting President Cheeto, it just makes me so excited, but I'm having some trouble deciding exactly how I want to picture him'do I want the whistleblower to be a suave James Bond type in a suit, or more of a ripped, muscular superhero?' said Gillford, 49, who added that she was hoping to visualize a fantasy version of the whistleblower that could bring her to a shuddering climax matching the intensity that the thought of a shirtless, oiled-up Robert Mueller did during his special investigation. 'I just want to masturbate to the justice of it, but the image in my mind is lacking a certain specificity right now. It was so easy when I was thinking about how alluring it was watching Preet Bharara stand up to the president, and I still remember how hard I came when I pictured that rugged silver fox James Mattis tell he-who-shall-not-be-named that he was putting country over party. I'll think of something, though, even if it's just imagining the whistleblower with a six-pack and flowing hair riding a horse like I did with Adam Schiff. Put it this way'I'd let him in on my state secrets.' At press time, 2,849 other users had commented on her Facebook post about the whistleblower describing the ways they had sexualized the anonymous official and what they wanted him to do to them."

'[The President of the United States of America] shall hold his Office during the Term of four Years, and, together with the Vice President, chosen for the same Term, can talk to whatever foreign official he wants about any subject whenever he wants, consequence-free,' read the memo, which White House sources indicated did not include the full text of the nation's founding document but offered a summation of its important points such as 'Congress has the power to shut up and stay out of the President's way.' 'The President, Vice President, and all Civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors, assuming they are Democratic officials. This impeachment process shall not hold in the event that the president is a former real estate developer whose party controls the Senate...Make America Great Again! Trump 2020!' At press time, legal scholars had suggested that despite the edits, the memorandum contained over a dozen examples of the president breaking the law."

'She's obviously not used to following her conscience like this, or acting in accordance with any clear set of principles, so the experience has left her completely drained,' said Pelosi's communication director, Ashley Etienne, confirming that medical personnel administered fluids to the speaker after she went an entire news cycle without ever capitulating, an amount of strain that can be life-threatening for a 17-term lawmaker. 'Once her voice started to quiver and she slumped down at the end of her speech, we realized her body simply couldn't take this level of sustained effort. We're honestly just amazed she lasted as long as she did.' At press time, sources reported House Democratic leaders had postponed the impeachment investigation once more after a doctor prescribed six months of bed rest for Pelosi."

'What if those Ukrainian guys find out about that time last year I got my recess privileges taken away for acting up in class?' the visibly panicked third-grader said as he repeatedly searched beneath his bed and inside his closet to make sure there weren't any unfinished school assignments or other incriminating materials that could be used against him or his father. 'I don't think I've done anything too bad, but I'd better cover my tracks just in case. Oh God'there is that time I copied my friend Tyler's math homework! It only happened once, though, and I don't think he'll talk. Still, they went after Hunter [Biden], and it's only a matter of time before they start digging up dirt on me.'

'Yet again, we have seen the cruel and vindictive nature of a president who thinks it's acceptable to hurl schoolyard taunts at this wonderful young woman instead of acting very interested in what she has to say and then doing nothing whatsoever about it,' said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, adding that this incident raised questions about the fundamental decency of someone who would mock a 12-year-old activist when he should be gleaning whatever social capital he can from her and then pretending as though she never existed. 'I want to say right now to Ms. Thunberg that Donald Trump's dismissive comments do not represent the country as a whole. I assure you that the next time you want to speak to leaders who could benefit from being associated with climate activism, the Democratic party is here for you as long as the cameras are rolling and not a second longer.' Hoyer went on to condemn Fox News for launching ad hominem attacks against Thunberg instead of merely criticizing her proposals as unrealistic and anti-business."

'If these allegations are true that Ukraine allowed itself to be blackmailed by President Trump, we have no choice but to denounce these actions in the strongest possible terms. It's deeply reckless for Ukraine to push us towards investigating criminal behavior, especially so close to an election year, and we hope this resolution will put an end to that.'

'Help! Help! Can anyone hear me? Jesus Christ, how are there two tidal waves in the middle of the city?' At press time, Kennedy was spotted waving to paparazzi while boarding a rickety vintage light plane and setting off towards a campaign appearance directly into a raging thunderstorm."

'I am ordering a sustained bombing offensive in Afghanistan since there's a really good chance that if we launch enough missiles, one of them has to veer off course and eventually strike Iran,' said Pompeo, adding that they are going to make sure to put their most inept military commanders in charge of the air attacks and just wait until one ballistic missile deviates and destroys a residential neighborhood in the Islamic Republic. 'Instead of directly engaging with Iran, we're just going to send a bunch more drones to Afghanistan and let our incompetence play itself out. Given our track record, it really shouldn't take too long.' At press time, Pompeo decided that the U.S. military might as well ratchet up bombing in Syria and Yemen to make it happen faster. "

'The primary actor behind the strike on our Saudi allies was definitely Iran or one of those countries in that same part of the world'someplace with a lot of deserts, a lot of Muslims, a lot of guys with beards,' Trump said to members of the White House press corps, adding, 'Syria maybe? Jordan?' before his voice dropped off to an inaudible mumble. 'The American people can trust we will take swift action against...Qatar? No, that's not it. We're pretty sure Saudi Arabia didn't do it, because why would they? Why would you bomb your own oil refineries? Then again, you never know. You never can tell. What do you guys think?' The president later clarified that the United States would bomb whichever country the Saudis paid it to bomb."
324,John Bolton Asked To Leave Condo Board Meeting After Repeatedly Advocating Bombing Isaacsons,"BETHESDA, MD'Following the former Trump administration national security advisor receiving several warnings to tone down the use of violent rhetoric against other residents, John Bolton was reportedly asked Monday to leave a condo board meeting after repeatedly advocating bombing the Isaacsons. 'Mr. Bolton, we must ask that you remove yourself until you can have a calm, rational discussion about the Isaacson family's noise or over-use of common spaces without recommending double-tapping their unit with an MQ-9 Reaper drone,' said condo board president Marcia Lewis, adding that while she understood Bolton had recently lost his job and was spending more time at his residence, there was a formal process for lodging a complaint that didn't include any options for the use of military force against the Isaacsons, nor for selling drones to a neighboring condo association that could act as a proxy. 'We've done some research into your proposal, and we concluded that it would almost certainly kill the Isaacson family, including their three children, as well as cause mass casualties among the Portico's other residents, which strikes us as a profound overreaction to Billy Isaacson hitting your car's side mirror with his basketball the other day. And while we will look into your claim that the family is harboring pets, we have to remind you that owning a dog is not an act of aggression, Mr. Bolton. Furthermore, we have to ask you to tone down your attacks on the Sawyers, as hosting guests late, while annoying, is not a grave threat to national security. In the future, we really suggest you try sitting down with these families for a cup of coffee rather than continuing to call for an all-out aerial assault.' At press time, the condo board had issued Bolton a warning after learning that he had contacted a local demolition company in an effort to get them to knock down the condo building."

'The DNC thinks I need to get at least 2% in four qualifying polls, but they think so small,' said the author and presidential hopeful, who announced that by unlocking a deep and powerful mental space at the core of her being, she could participate in the debate at Texas Southern University despite having failed to meet the 'narrow-minded' threshold set by party leaders. 'By avoiding all negative thoughts and putting mind over matter, I have been able to transcend mere material concerns such as poll numbers. While I don't have the necessary support of voters, I do have something far more valuable: a profound belief in the oneness of all living things.' At press time, sources confirmed a podium of pure light had sprung up before Williamson as she began to answer a question from George Stephanopoulos about how she would respond as president to an economy on the brink of recession."

331,House Democrats Vow To Hold President Accountable With Agriculture Bill Where First Letter Of Every Line Spells Out 'Impeach Trump',"WASHINGTON'Seeking to mollify a segment of their base clamoring for inquiries into the president's misconduct, House Democrats announced Tuesday that they would be holding the administration accountable by voting on an agricultural bill in which the first letter of every line spells out 'Impeach Trump.' 'We believe this is a fair compromise that falls short of the full impeachment inquiry some have asked for, but still shows voters who have the correct decoder that Democrats aren't taking this president's crimes lying down,' said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, telling reporters that the bill had been brought to the floor despite objections from Democrats in battleground districts who generally favored a more complex alphabetic cipher that would eventually spell out 'Impeach Trump if polling improves,' or, 'Impeach Trump at the ballot box.' 'When our children look back on this period of history, they will know that the Democratic party served as a check on this corrupt administration by putting forward a bold and straightforward word puzzle proclaiming that this is not who we are as Americans.' At press time, an elated Hoyer confirmed that the House had secured the bill's passage after tacking on an additional $2.5 million in funding for the president's border wall."
332,Ex-CIA Agent Valerie Plame Releases Campaign Video Depicting Her Torturing Voters,"SANTA FE, NM'Announcing her intent to run as a Democrat for New Mexico's 3rd Congressional District, former CIA agent and author Valerie Plame released a campaign video Monday in which she is shown using the skills she learned as a spy to torture voters. 'Hi, my name is Valerie Plame, and I want to put my specialized CIA training to work for the American people,' said Plame in the video, which shows her smiling with a diverse group of potential voters before zip-tying their wrists, covering their heads with bags, and locking them in the trunk of a black Chevy Camaro. 'Whether I'm fighting to secure infrastructure funding, working to improve healthcare, or rounding up our most suspicious residents and simulating their drowning, I will stop at nothing to protect New Mexico families. I've got a few scores to settle, and that's why I'm asking for your vote.' As the video closes, Plame was seen in a local diner beating a 70-year-old man to within an inch of his life after having deprived him of sleep and water for days."

'To be clear, Trump International Golf Links and Hotel Ireland is located only 240 miles below the International Space Station, where the members of this crew will be working for the next six months,' press secretary Stephanie Grisham said of the arrangement, which, depending on the station's position in its orbit, will reportedly require astronauts to spend 16 to 22 hours of each day traveling through space. 'These brave heroes deserve to stay in a comfortable, amenity-filled hotel instead of the cramped quarters of the ISS. Besides, some of the crew members are of Irish descent and thus have ancestral connections to the area.' According to NASA sources, the astronauts were forced to take the stairs to their ninth-floor suite because of numerous out-of-service elevators and appeared to be the only guests at the resort."

'This is a great opportunity for us to get a lot of face time with the presidential candidates about addressing our needs in their platforms,' said Heidi Grumblebelt, a 2000-pound spokesbison for the 'Center For Herd Progress' super PAC, looking radiant in an Alexander McQueen gown as she showed off the grass dishes at each $1000-a-trough table setting. 'This year we've partnered with sister organizations in the tree and eagle communities, many of whom donated prizes for our silent auction. We know that money talks, so hosting this event for major Democratic candidates is the best shot that American bison have of seeing their agenda in action.' At press time, a whistleblower revealed that nearly all of the money raised had been embezzled to buy extravagant new grazing fields for the gala organizers. "
338,Marianne Williamson Deletes Tweets About Using Mind To Control Weather After Realizing Nation Unprepared To Wield Such Great Power,"SACRAMENTO, CA'After reviewing responses to her post, Democratic presidential candidate Marianne Williamson deleted a tweet Wednesday that suggested people use their minds to turn Hurricane Dorian away from land, and later told reporters the nation was not yet ready to harness such awesome powers. 'I wholeheartedly apologize for implying that untrained minds should use mental energy blasts to deter any object, hurricane or otherwise,' said the self-help guru, noting that she had miscalculated the willingness and ability of average citizens to access the part of their brain that allows for weather manipulation, levitation of objects, and telekinesis. 'If used with malicious intent, this type of power could, for example, cause the Earth's rotation to reverse, taking us back in time and potentially ripping apart the space-time continuum. All life on the planet could be wiped out if someone tried to harness a psionic beam while holding a crystal. It is now clear to me that Americans will not be prepared to assume such responsibility for quite some time, perhaps not until my second term.' Sources confirmed Williamson's tweet was replaced by an ad for her latest seminar, 'Your Mind, the Weather, and You,' and an offer to use the code 'LOVE' at checkout for a discounted ticket price of $199."
339,Biden Campaign Concerned After Candidate Gives Unsolicited Back Rub To Coat Rack,"DES MOINES, IA'As concerns mount over the viability of the gaffe-prone candidate, sources confirmed Wednesday that the campaign of former Vice President Joe Biden is increasingly worried following an incident in which the Democratic front-runner reportedly gave an unsolicited back rub to a coat rack. 'He gave the rack a little squeeze, whispered that it felt awfully stiff, and started pressing his thumbs into it,' said deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield in a meeting with top staffers, lamenting that a member of the press had taken a photo of Biden massaging the standalone coat rack. 'Thank God no one was close enough to hear him compliment the coat rack on its tall, thin frame and beautiful chocolate brown skin, or joke about how he sure wouldn't mind being 30 years younger. We'll have to put out a statement saying he was just admiring the craftsmanship, like we did in New Hampshire after he nuzzled up against that stage curtain.' At press time, the nation's top political pundits continued to report that Biden remained the only candidate with a chance of beating President Trump in 2020."
340,How 2020 Presidential Candidates Can Raise Their Polling Numbers,"With seemingly every new poll showing changes in the Democratic race and competitive polling between leading Democratic challengers and President Trump, every campaign is searching for ways to improve its polling numbers. The Onion breaks down what each candidate can do to get their numbers up. Remind voters he's only had two previous presidential campaigns to figure this all out. Open up to voters by revealing offbeat, quirky side. Ramp up outreach to the chronically ignored demographic of MSNBC and CNN pundits. Another Hamptons speech or two ought to do it. What do you have to lose? Bump it to 2K a month. Emphasize background running profitable healthcare company to ensure Americans firmly associate him with current state of nation's healthcare. Significantly raise average own campaign donation. Pace herself while rest of the candidates who don't stand for anything drop out. Put her money where her mouth is and decapitate a banker."
341,Obamas Sign Exclusive 6-Truck Deal To Produce Series Of Mid-Size RAM Pickups,"AUBURN HILLS, MI'Touting their excitement over the rare opportunity to offer a motor vehicle developed with the signature sense of style of a former leader of the free world, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles of North America announced Tuesday that Barack and Michelle Obama have signed a multimillion-dollar six-truck contract to produce a series of mid-size RAM pickups. 'For the 2021 model year, we will roll out a new series of medium-platform RAM trucks in six trim levels, all with clean-sheet designs masterminded by the Obama family, continuing the legacy of the former POTUS and FLOTUS of inspiring Americans through unparalleled power, smooth handling, and class-leading comfort,' said RAM chief of design Joseph Dehner, noting that the trucks would be available in variants from the youth/sport-oriented Malia base model to the luxury Audacity flagship. 'The Obama family still has a lot to say about American life, particularly where legroom, wireless device charging, and towing capabilities are concerned, and they were proud to lend their unique voices to RAM's design vocabulary, as well as to our navigation systems as an added-cost option. With the former first family at the wheel, the new RAM can't help but bridge the divide between America's aspiring luxury buyers and economy-minded consumers.' While little else is known concerning the Obama-designed truck, sources at RAM confirmed that power will be provided by Chrysler's dependable 3.6-liter V-6 engine, pricing will start around $35,000, and styling will include signature red, white, blue, and limited-edition tan colorways."
342,Help! Help! Who Am I? Where Am I? Who Are You People?' Says Biden In Embarrassing Campaign Gaffe,"DES MOINES, IA'Following an uncomfortable flub on the campaign trail, political experts warned Tuesday that Joe Biden's latest gaffe of repeatedly shouting 'Help! Who am I? Where am I? Who are you people?' during a recent rally in Iowa risked embarrassing the candidate during his presidential run. 'Biden is still the clear Democratic front-runner, but voters are increasingly expressing skepticism about his decision to wander out onto a campaign stage, blink blearily for several seconds, and tell the assembled crowd to go away because they're loud and scary and he wants to be by himself,' said analyst Alexa Barbin, noting that the former vice president's predilection for coming up to individual rally attendees and asking 'Are you Barack?' while staring at them with wide-eyed terror plays into a narrative that could damage Biden's standing among primary voters. 'Democrats still like Biden a lot, and a large part of what they're responding to is the unscripted, off-the-cuff charm that they're not getting from politicians who necessarily know who they're talking to or what year it is. When Joe Biden is out there on the stump day after day, asking what everyone is doing in his bedroom while he's trying to sleep, Americans know he's fighting for them.' At press time, the Biden campaign announced that the candidate would be issuing a forceful argument about why he was best positioned to defeat Trump as soon as the former vice president began recognizing his caretakers' faces again."

'Hey, you redneck simpletons, put down your whittling sticks, drag yourself away from the Cracker Barrel, and let us tell you how it is,' said a team of Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer on the debut commercial, part of a widespread advertising blitz that will be played at NASCAR races and monster truck rallies across the country. 'We know you can barely read, so we'll spell this out for you: The Republican tax plan will only benefit the rich. Don't you dumb hicks get that?

344,Heroic Secret Service Agent Takes Bull Intended For President,"WASHINGTON'Placing his own body between the head of state and a mortal threat without a single thought or moment's hesitation, Secret Service agent Dan McGuire took a bull intended for President Donald Trump Thursday as they crossed the White House lawn. 'I remember seeing suspicious movement out of the corner of my eye, something that could have been a hoof or a horn, and my training just took over,' said McGuire, whose decision to interpose himself between President Trump and the hard-charging 1,200-pound bovine was simply a part of the job he had been prepared to do since his first day at the Treasury Department. 'You train for this with rubber simulators, but you never know what it will be to face the real thing. When the adrenaline kicked in, though, it was like everything went into slow motion. There was lots of snorting, and people were screaming 'Look out!' and 'Ol!' They say there may have been a second bull that just missed us, but I'm definitely the wrong guy to ask. First thing I remember, I was on the ground being told not to move'luckily, the vest took most of the impact.' Secret Service personnel say Agent McGuire is the first security officer to take a bull for the president since 1958 when Agent Arnold Morgan was struck in the chest by a stampede meant for Dwight Eisenhower."

'After conducting an objective and highly scientific survey of likely primary voters, we discovered there is a new frontrunner in the race for the 2020 Democratic nomination: Tom Steyer,' said institute director Kat Taylor, who co-founded the think tank earlier this week with her husband, Tom Steyer.

At the same time, we found that in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina, Ohio, Florida, Michigan, Wisconsin, and 42 additional states, the leading candidate is Tom Steyer.' After reviewing the Steyer Institute's poll numbers, the Democratic National Committee confirmed not only that Tom Steyer has qualified to participate in September's debate, but that he is the only candidate to have done so."

'I don't want to keep living in a world without David Koch,' said former Wisconsin governor Scott Walker, one amongst a throng of weeping Republicans including Mike Pence, Ted Cruz, Rick Scott, and Mitt Romney who shoved past the other mourners for the privilege of setting fire to themselves and flinging their burning bodies onto the billionaire conservative activist's corpse. 'Get the hell out of my way, Rubio'you know he loved me best! I should be on top of the body. Jesus Christ, David! David! Don't go into the next life without me!' At press time, attendants were forced to intervene with fire extinguishers after the entire Cato Institute board of directors piled onto the corpse at once and caused the blaze to rapidly spread across Koch's enormous estate."

'America, as your leader, I need you to look me in the eye and let me know there's no one in this country prettier than me'no one,' said the 45th president, who demanded the event's approximately 10,000 attendees call him their 'special, gorgeous baby' and later yelled, 'I don't believe you! I don't believe you,' when the crowd started up a chant of 'You are beautiful' that continued for several minutes. 'You wouldn't lie to me, right? I can tell when you're lying, because you don't even really mean what you're chanting, you're just telling me what I want to hear to make me stay. Well, you know what, Virginia? Fuck you. I'll go find some supporters who will appreciate me for the perfect, special president that I really am.'

'Although today marks the conclusion of my 2020 presidential bid, I want all of you to know that my wisdom will forever be in the soil of this magnificent grove and my hope will be in the sky above,' said Inslee at a press conference held deep in the Olympic National Forest as he vanished in a bath of warm light, only to reappear moments later in the guise of an ancient white oak lit by luminous bands of fireflies, his arms transforming into long, twisting branches while his voice echoed through the millennia-old thicket as if by the enchantment of nature itself. 'Whenever you need my guidance to help fight for the future of our planet, just come to this wooded spot and listen for the whisper of the wind between these branches and the dappling of light upon theses leaves. There you will hear my voice. There you will see my spirit.' At press time, Inslee had been burned alive in a blaze caused by a poorly maintained fire pit."

'Standing here today, I vow that I'm not done fighting for the people of the Lakewood Metropolitan Area, because although I'm no longer running for Senate, this is not the end of the story,' said Hickenlooper, kicking off his campaign surrounded by a dozen supporters at the Colorado Railroad Museum shortly after announcing an end to his 2020 bid for a Senate seat due to lackluster funding and polling behind seven other candidates. 'For all my supporters, from Wheat Ridge to parts of Arvada, who urged me leave the Senate race to concentrate on running for county commissioner, I want you to know I heard you loud and clear. Nothing will keep me from finally getting the stoplight fixed on Route 58, acquiring new playground equipment for Kittredge Park, or securing the speed bumps that residents across Littleton sorely need. These issues are important to me, and with the $230 we've saved from my now-ended Senate campaign, I'm confident that I can best serve Americans as the district three commissioner of Jefferson County.' At press time, Hickenlooper announced that he was abandoning his struggling county commissioner campaign to run for treasurer of Bow Mar."

'Unfortunately, President Trump never asked nor received permission to play audio of hogs slamming against a large metal cage, chickens being decapitated, or cows being shot in the head with a bolt gun,' said Tyson Foods CEO Noel W. White, adding that the sounds were never meant to endorse any particular political party or be played while a candidate walked out to thousands of cheering supporters. 'While we appreciate that people enjoy our recordings of cattle being tased and slaughtered in front of their young, we kindly ask that the Trump campaign stop playing it at events. As it stands, President Trump already owes our Dakota City beef-packing plant hundreds of thousands of dollars in residuals.' At press time, Werner Hertzog had also sent the Trump campaign a cease-and-desist notice after the president was recorded dancing to the audio of Timothy Treadwell being eaten by a bear at a 2020 fundraiser."

'This is a critical time for our country, and to beat Donald Trump, we cannot focus on who can string together three or four words coherently or provide the American people with a lucid plan for the future,' said Biden, adding that Democrats across the nation should come together and ignore those who can speak in interviews without uttering garbled nonsense. 'We are at a crucial crossroads and we shouldn't just be persuaded by someone with the mental capacity to know where they are or what they're doing. This isn't about plans, ideas, or the ability to remember what their advisors told them right before the interview. This is about winning back the Oval Office.' At press time, Biden insisted that Democrats should be concerned with current polls and disregard a candidate's words, actions, and incompetence."

'The station manager told me they were going to try to fit it in by the end of the next block, so I'm getting pretty psyched. I told my wife and a couple of my buddies from my PAC to be sure to tune in, too. Shh, shh, I think this is it! Oh, damn, never mind, it's just another one for Elizabeth Warren.'

'Plus, we're gonna use this lighter we found to melt our coins down into a gold bar. Then America will have so much money that it won't matter what China does.

367,Mitch McConnell Wonders If He Could've Done More To Harm People In Private Sector,"WASHINGTON'Reflecting on his 34-year career in Congress that led to his becoming the most powerful person in the Senate, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reportedly noted Wednesday that he couldn't help but wonder sometimes if he could've done more to harm people in the private sector. 'Sure, I've been able to hurt a lot of everyday Americans during my time in the Senate carrying out the Republican Party's destructive vision, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't sometimes ask myself whether I could've done more to increase suffering in this country if I'd worked as an oil lobbyist or mining sector CEO,' said McConnell, who admitted that he often lies awake at night pondering the lives he could've ruined if he hadn't entered the public sector at such a young age. 'Now, of course, I'm in a position where I can offer grave harm and ruin to tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions of people, but I think of the early years when I didn't have as much power in Congress and imagine myself making more of a difference crippling the futures of people on a state or local level. I'm proud of using my public service to cause as much pain and suffering as possible, of course, but there's a part that always gnaws at me, wondering whether I could've done more in a career as a defense sector executive or pharmaceutical tycoon. At the end of the day, I just hope I've done enough.' McConnell also said that he sometimes wondered what it would be like to work hard and become a self-made man rather than marrying into money."

'Great, now we're going to be here all night figuring out a way to walk back this offhanded remark,' said White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, who expressed concern that with a single flippant comment, the president had blemished his administration's record of consistently siding with and empowering people who believe the United States belongs, first and foremost, to white people. 'We've worked so hard to make sure he stays on message not only by directly voicing racist views, but by personally embodying bigotry'and now he goes off script and criticizes those exact things!

Highly placed sources have confirmed that it is only natural to imagine that Hickenlooper, who launched his campaign for the Democratic nomination back in what most are pretty sure was March, has probably dropped out, as he did not stand a reasonable chance of winning in the first place. While no further inquiry into the status of Hickenlooper's campaign is forthcoming or realistically necessary, one may safely assume that this headline, if not true now, cannot ultimately be false, and will in fact be accurate in every major particular within the next week. Therefore, the Onion Editorial Board has concluded that it is only logical to pursue more pressing journalistic endeavors and acknowledge the inevitable demise of this quixotic campaign. This newspaper will dutifully update this article to reflect the day of the week and city in which Hickenlooper will ultimately stand before the cameras, surrounded by his wanly smiling family, and pledge his meager support to whoever the eventual Democratic Party nominee might be. As we shall not be following up on Hickenlooper's further and presumptively fruitless activities, we urge citizens to pursue any other avenue of information they deem necessary, which from a practical perspective is, of course, none. An informed populace is crucial to democracy, so feel free to investigate yourself, but do not attempt to contact this newspaper or its employees, as we do not care."
370,John Delaney Sends Fundraising Email To Wife Asking To Use More Of Their Money On His Campaign,"BETHESDA, MD'Noting that the coming months were crucial to determining who would stay in the running for the Democratic nomination, the campaign of presidential candidate John Delaney sent a fundraising email to his wife Monday asking to use more of the couple's money on his bid for the White House. 'Dear April, we need another $15 million from our personal fortune to help bring our message to the American people: Will you donate today?' read the email signed by the candidate and sent solely to his wife, observing that she had been a frequent supporter of John Delaney since she married him almost 30 years ago. 'Obviously, you're a believer in this cause. Otherwise, you and I wouldn't discuss it over the phone most nights. But we need to increase our contributions if we're going to make it to the third debate in September. Will you act now and give me the go-ahead?' The fundraising email went on to state that if April Delaney made her donation within the next week, she would be entered in a drawing for a chance to grab a drink with her husband and chat one-on-one."

'Despite all the fear-mongering on behalf of politically motivated scientists, carbon emissions are not harmful in any way, as you can see,' said a coughing, unsteady Wheeler, moments before he was seen vomiting, losing his balance, and collapsing onto the pavement. 'They pose no threat at all to the American public, and any hysterical claims to the contrary have no basis in reality. Sure, it does burn the lungs a little, but it doesn't cause any serious harm to internal organs'look, I'll even take another puff. Oh, God. Oh, God. Someone help me.' At press time, local authorities had confirmed Wheeler's death."
373,A Timeline Of U.S.'Iran Relations,"Tensions continue to mount between the United States and Iran, driven by conflicts that have gone back decades and stoking fears of war. The Onion looks back at the history of U.S.'Iran relations. Britain and the Soviet Union invade Iran to counter Germany's expanding influence and show the Nazis how imperialism is really done. Fazlollah Zahedi replaces Mohammad Mosaddegh as prime minister after being democratically elected by a majority of CIA officers. Something or other happening over there affects gas prices in the U.S. Iran releases 52 hostages into the far crueler prison of Reagan's America. Ronald Reagan diagnosed with early stages of dementia. U.S. shoots down an Iranian passenger plane, killing all 290 people on board, and for some reason is still seen as the aggressor in the region. Argo wins Best Picture, infuriating Iranians who were really pulling for Silver Linings Playbook. Secret Muslim and Antichrist, Barack HUSSEIN Obama (sworn in on a Quran disguised as a Bible), signs the Iran nuclear deal. U.S. media overwhelmingly votes to authorize war with Iran. Let's just say it's going to be very, very bad."
374,Highlights Of The Second Democratic Debates,"The second round of the Democratic presidential debates pitted the top 20 polling candidates against each other across two nights in Detroit. The Onion highlights the most important takeaways from the second Democratic debates. CNN moderators scolding candidates for straying from entertaining personal attacks. Sparks flying between Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as they argued over who personally threw more people in jail. Audiences continuing to tune out Andrew Yang's boring, wonky obsession with robot apocalypse. Patriotic challenge round where candidates recite Pledge of Allegiance going around in a circle one word at a time. Moderator Jake Tapper straight-up asking candidates to name which country they'd nuke first. Julian Castro given chance to steal debate point after Cory Booker flubs question on immigration policy. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders avoiding CNN's brazen attempts at turning the debates into something fun to watch. Biden pausing during answer on climate change trying to remember what he's supposed to think now. In an act of protest, Jay Inslee boycotts event and sends an endangered Redwood tree to speak on his behalf. Progressives engaging in self-defeating strategy of acting like Barack Obama was not a king among men, perfection on high, all praises be unto him. Biden turning to Tulsi Gabbard and saying 'I thought you were an angel when you first walked in' several times throughout the night. Clear winner once again people who did something else with their time."

'C'mon, man, Billy Boy's been running his damn mouth about all kinds of progressive ideas I know you disagree with, and I bet they're pissing you off, so are you gonna sack up and take a swing or what?' said Tapper, before asking de Blasio a follow-up question as to whether the New York City mayor was 'just going to sit there and take it.' 'Time's a-ticking, Senator. There's no moderate compromise in pussyfooting on this'step up right here in front of the podiums and show the mayor you've got the stones to be president. You think the nation is going to trust you with the nuclear arsenal if you can't even grow a pair and throw a punch? You ready to show the American people watching tonight that you're a real man, or are you too chickenshit?' At press time, after a weeping Bennet had fled the stage, Tapper turned to Jay Inslee and said the candidate had 30 seconds to address what the fuck he was looking at."

'I was raised on potholed streets, and my parents struggled, sometimes having to choose between whether to put gas in our tanks or feed the meter so we had a place to park at night,' said the New York senator, her voice tinged with emotion as she related how her father, a four-door domestic sedan with only 100,000 miles, fell behind on his repair bills, failed inspection, and was ultimately towed away to a junkyard. 'No family of vehicles should ever have to make a choice like that, and when I'm president, I will fight to ensure no one has to. I'll never forget where I came from.' Sources confirmed Gillibrand was later greeted with silence when she asked who else on the stage that night could claim to have been built by union labor 'right here in the great state of Michigan.'"

'Hey, gang! What do you say we all head down to Lyman's for some brews and jalapeno poppers on me?' said Graham, addressing a group of 22-year-old summer interns working quietly and pretending not to hear the invitation. 'I passed a couple of real dive bars on my way over here, so maybe we can get a game of darts going? That is if anyone thinks they can beat the Graham Man. So, you're all busy? Okay. Right. Okay, I'm gonna head out there now, but if one of you can give me a phone number, I'll snag us a booth and text you where I'm sitting.' Graham was seen two hours later in the parking lot, evidently holding back tears upon spotting the interns boarding an Uber on their way to a house party."

'Oh Jesus, please, please, please'Beto's in WAY over his head, and he really needs your help!' read the header from the digressive, 1,500-word email, which featured a photograph from the debate that showed a visibly panicked O'Rourke above the caption 'This is a complete trainwreck.' 'Even a few dollars can make a difference. They're wiping the goddamn floor with him up there, and we're going to need every penny we can get to make up for what's happening tonight.

'To answer your question, I'd like to invite to the stage one of my staunchest enemies to tell him to his face that we will simply not let him treat immigrants in this country like criminals,' Williamson said to the hand-sewn Trump puppet with a felt suit and yellow hair, which she had taken from under her lectern and put on her hand, refusing to break her gaze with its googly eyes even after it had flapped its hands in distress and hung its head in shame. 'Mr. President, we know who you are, and what you are. You are a bad man with hate in your heart, and Americans are not going to sit here while you erode the freedoms we hold so dear. I want you to take a look around, that's right, take a long look around at all the people here tonight'Mr. Tapper, please let me finish'and remember that all of these people are going to stop your terrible agenda, with whatever it takes.'

'Just a little further past this log and you'll see the CNN audience,' said the campaign aide for Hickenlooper, forcing a smile as he pointed the Democratic presidential candidate towards a quiet thicket where they wouldn't be overheard. 'Sorry about the detour, but you're almost there, and then you can explain all your ideas about investing in America's infrastructure and working with private industry to fight against climate change. That sounds good, doesn't it? Don't be scared, Johnnie, just keep your eyes forward, and in only a few seconds, you won't ever have to worry about poll numbers again.'

'Ah, Mr. Moulton, you strike me as a man of great ambition'perhaps there's something among my wares that could help you achieve your most cherished desire, hmm?' said the old and withered proprietor, proffering a series of items to the congressman as her eyes reportedly glimmered with mischief. 'This lavalier microphone will let you be the greatest public speaker there ever was, though you may find that the words you're saying aren't always your own. Or maybe you'd be interested in this American flag pin'it will energize your base by a hundredfold, yet for its last owner, being forever surrounded by obsessed, adoring fans was more than he bargained for. Nothing for nothing, Mr. Moulton, and everything in its time.' At press time, a thrilled Moulton was leaving the shop clutching a necktie guaranteed to give him fame while ignoring the shopkeeper's veiled admonishment that its wearer would ultimately be doomed to a life of political obscurity."
389,What To Expect In The Second Democratic Debates,"The second round of the Democratic Party 2020 primary debates will feature the top 20 presidential candidates over two nights in Detroit. The Onion takes a look at what viewers should be watching for in the second Democratic debates. Bernie Sanders stuttering response after briefly forgetting who economy rigged against. More intimate feel with one large family-style podium. Marianne Williamson following up previous debate by absolutely tearing New Zealand a new one. Generally joyless affair without affable, energizing presence of Eric Swalwell. $3.50 Miller Lites and $1 hot dogs. Several excruciating moments of Joe Biden gathering himself. CNN scheduling error on second night leading to Steve Bullock being only candidate onstage. The same hundred words Andrew Yang memorized for the first debate. Julin Castro demanding to know what the fuck happened to all his buzz. Overall, probably less entertaining and informative than whatever TBS plans on showing."
390,More Presidential Candidates Taking Strident Pro-Caviar Stance To Appeal To Democratic Socialite Wing Of Party,"WASHINGTON'Doubling down on new policy in an effort to cater to the most influential segment of their base, an increasing number of 2020 presidential contenders were pushing strongly pro-caviar positions Tuesday in an effort to appeal to the Democratic Socialite wing of the party. 'Today, too many Americans are forced to choose between beluga caviar, steak tartare, and truffle-infused risotto cakes, when a full selection of amuses-bouche should be guaranteed to all,' said White House hopeful Kirsten Gillibrand, who like most candidates has pledged to fight aggressively for top-shelf canaps and aperitifs in an effort to court the jet-setting bon viveur faction of the Democratic electorate. 'We live in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, and it's outrageous that our richest cognacs or fullest-bodied Zinfandels still do not reflect that. We can't make do with the same tired old cheese plates and bacon-wrapped dates Washington has offered us time and time again. We need bold, fresh tasting menus if we're going to save our nation's struggling galas.' Gillibrand has joined fellow candidates Beto O'Rourke, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris in promising that, if elected, she would fight to remove unnecessary restrictions on top-shelf pours at the open bar.

391,"Andrew Yang Loads Shotgun As Hissing, Crackling Copy Machine Lurches Towards Campaign Staff","WASHINGTON'Kicking off the power cord that was coiling itself around his ankle, Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang frantically attempted to load a shotgun Monday as a hissing, crackling copy machine lurched towards campaign staffers. 'I've got the copier. Zach, you destroy the cell phones, and for God's sake, everyone, stay away from the Keurig, it's sparking,' said Yang, firing a shot that obliterated the sentient machine's paper tray before pumping three more rounds into the dishwasher that had crept up behind him from the break room. 'Quick, that fax machine is reactivating all the desktop computers, smash it before it gets to the thermostat. It's me the electronics want, and they'll kill anyone who gets in their way.' At press time, a lone iPad had beeped to life amidst the smoking ruins of democratic candidate's former campaign headquarters, its charred, cracked screen reading only, 'Yang Must Go.'"
392,"Trump Escalates Baltimore Attacks With Rambling, 3-Hour Press Conference Tearing Into Edgar Allan Poe","WASHINGTON'Criticizing the 19th-century writer as a 'death-obsessed weirdo with very little literary talent,' President Trump doubled down on his attacks against the city of Baltimore Monday by tearing into Edgar Allan Poe during a rambling, three-hour press conference on the White House lawn. 'This guy was a pathetic loser and boozehound who was too busy crying about his lost love to write any half-decent stories,' said Trump during an oftentimes discursive and meandering speech that mocked the 'disgusting, cousin-marrying hack' for his 'boring' short stories and poems. 'Everyone says The Raven, okay? But a raven? Not very scary. Not scary at all. It's just a dumb bird. Maybe if he had spent less time concerned about internal rhyme schemes and more time fixing the broken and crime-ridden city that he lived in, we wouldn't have these problems in Baltimore right now'he's a disgrace to the Whig Party. Not original. Not smart. And I know a lot of people who love detective fiction, and they all tell me Poe's Dupin character was a disaster, just a complete disaster for the genre.' Media analysts noted that Trump's attacks stand in stark contrast to his habit of routinely heaping praise on Romanticists associated with New York like Washington Irving and Herman Melville."
393,Chuck Grassley Accidentally Lies In State For Few Hours After Drifting Off In Capitol Rotunda,"WASHINGTON'Surrounded by onlookers, former colleagues, and Supreme Court Justices paying respect to the slumbering U.S. Senator, Chuck Grassley (R-IA) accidentally lay in state for a few hours Monday after drifting off in the Capitol rotunda. 'Today, we honor a giant of the United States Senate, a devoted father, and a dear personal friend for his great service to this country,' said a tearful Majority Whip John Cornyn in a stirring retrospective about the sleeping Iowa Republican, whose quietly dozing body had been mistakenly draped in a U.S. flag for public viewing just hours after the exhausted 85-year-old senator reportedly yawned and stretched out on the floor for a catnap beneath a frieze of George Washington. 'We may salute him today with a procession. We may lower the flags as he lies in repose. But we will never forget what he has sacrificed for our nation. Rest in peace, my friend.' Several hours after the ceremony ended, a dazed Grassley snapped awake in the darkened chamber, pulled several pieces of regalia off himself, and stumbled away in confusion while a member of the Capitol police wasn't looking."
394,Pelosi Concerned Outspoken Progressive Flank Of Party Could Harm Democrats' Reputation As Ineffectual Cowards,"WASHINGTON'Admitting she had worries about the rise of left-leaning activist groups within her party, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi expressed concerns Thursday that outspoken progressives could do permanent damage to Democrats' reputation as ineffectual cowards. 'They mean well, but if they continue to aggressively push their agenda like this, they run the risk of fundamentally altering the public's perception of Democrats as bumbling, feckless chumps,' said Pelosi, adding that this brash brand of politics could be easily manipulated by Republicans to paint the party as something other than a bunch of sniveling wimps who are too weak-willed and complacent to stand up for anything with even remote political risk. 'I understand where these groups are coming from, but while it might feel good to vent their frustrations about the state of the country, they could undermine what I believe should be our core 2020 argument: We are dithering, incompetent doormats who are infinitesimally less objectionable than our opposition.' Pelosi also noted that her concerns shouldn't be overstated, as she knew it would take more than a few activists for voters to associate the Democratic party with the vaguest inkling of courage."
395,Aging Congress Moves Into More Manageable Single-Story Ranch Capitol,"WASHINGTON'Explaining that the lawmakers had really begun to slow down over the last few years, the aging United States Congress announced Thursday that they would move into a more manageable single-story ranch Capitol. 'We don't do too much nowadays anyway, so it'll be easier to have a smaller place'plus, all those stairs out front were really messing with our knees,' said all 535 combined members of the House of Representatives and Senate, noting that the move was 'bittersweet' after 200 years in the historic First Street Capitol, but that the ranch structure was ultimately a safer and more comfortable choice for all. 'We don't even move around as much as we once did, so we don't need all that space with the big fancy dome and everything. Now everything we need is on the first floor. It's just more comfortable, especially for those of us who are starting to get confused easily.' Congress disclosed that the ultimate catalyst for the move came when Joe Manchin (D-WV) fell down in the previous Capitol's bathroom and was trapped there helpless for nine hours."
396,"It's Like All The President's Men Meets Rambo,' Says Robert Mueller Describing Report To Congress","WASHINGTON'Briefing members of Congress who he doubted had read all the way through the 'thrilling tale of redemption and American justice,' Robert Mueller pitched his special counsel report Wednesday as All The President's Men meets Rambo. 'It's just the story of an all-American badass who gets fed up with the system and dedicates his life to bringing down the corrupt powers that be,' Mueller told the House Judiciary Committee, adding that the 448-page report contains scenes of 'wall-to-wall action' in which a tough, determined underdog fights his way through the corridors of power in Washington before finally defeating all his enemies and restoring liberty to the land. 'This guy just crushes everything in his path. He's a killing machine, but he also has a code of honor. Though people constantly count him out, he never stops fighting for freedom and the American way. It's honestly a fantastic story, and I hope I get to write a sequel.' Mueller did express disappointment over an unfinished portion of the report in which the hero's archnemesis, Attorney General William Barr, gets kicked into an Air Force One jet engine."

'I can't believe how miserable and hopeless that place looks,' de Blasio said as he visited the Pleasant Hill Diner in Iowa, observing that if he were elected president, then perhaps New Yorkers wouldn't have to worry about such terrible things happening anymore. 'How can people there stand it? I know I don't want to live in a place like that. Somebody really ought to do something.' Before his aides ushered him to his next campaign event, De Blasio took one last look at the television and muttered that he was glad he didn't have to deal with any of that mess."
399,Justices Observe Supreme Court Ritual By Driving Stake Through John Paul Stevens' Heart To Ensure He Dead Before Burial,"WASHINGTON'Solemnly gathered around the former associate justice's casket, the nine current justices observed a traditional Supreme Court ritual Tuesday by driving a stake through John Paul Stevens' heart to ensure he was really dead before his burial. 'This is a longtime Supreme Court rite that began after one of the original justices, the Honorable William Cushing, was accidentally buried alive in 1802, and the justices who narrowly avoided that close call vowed it would never happen again,' said Associate Justice Stephen Breyer before taking the ceremonial gavel from Chief Justice John Roberts and using it to hammer the stake farther into the corpse of Stevens laid out in the Capitol rotunda. 'Unfortunately, after Justice Cushing was discovered when he knocked on the lid of his coffin just before it was lowered into the ground, some nasty rumors spread that the Supreme Court justices could come back from the dead, or were potentially immortal beings. The Marshall court obviously couldn't let this popular superstition gain any more credence among the American public, so beginning with William Paterson in 1806, every single Supreme Court justice has had a stake driven through their heart to assure the justices and the citizenry that they have truly passed away. Of course, it's been largely a formality, except for the unfortunate incident in 1930 when the Court accidentally killed William Howard Taft.' At press time, Roberts had determined that Stevens' heart wasn't beating and began to light the ceremonial pyre the Supreme Court ritually constructs to ensure the release of every justice's soul from their body and grant it safe passage to the afterlife."
400,Trump Campaign Store Offering Special Disavowed Discount On All 'Send Her Back' Merchandise,"WASHINGTON'In an effort to distance the President from a racist remark chanted about Congresswoman Ilhan Omar (D-MN) earlier this week, the Trump campaign store reportedly began offering a special disavowed discount Friday on all 'Send Her Back' merchandise. 'All this week, use the promo code BACK2SOMALIA for low, low prices on 'Send Her Back' hats, shirts, mugs, beach towels, and stickers,' read the Trump campaign store's website, which also advertised free shipping on all 'Tell Them To Leave'-related products, as well as exclusive buy-one-get-one-free deals on anything labeled 'Crime Infested.' 'Please, help us send all Omar, Ocasio-Cortez, Pressley, and Tlaib merchandise as far away from our store as possible. If you buy at least $50 worth of product, you'll receive an official thank you note from President Trump for helping Make America Great Again!' At press time, the Trump campaign store already had a new promotion featuring discounts on all 2020 campaign merchandise featuring racial slurs. "

Reflecting Pool,"WASHINGTON'Shivering in his swimsuit as he peered down at the water below, Senator Mark Warner (D-VA) reportedly held up a long line of senators Friday as they waited for the diving board at the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool. 'C'mon, Mark, just jump in already'you'll be fine! Plus, it's super hot out here,' said Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) before pushing the trembling Virginia congressman forward along the diving board in frustration, echoing the feelings of dozens of other senators who had waited for upwards of a half hour for their chance to pencil-dive or cannonball into the reflecting pool. 'Look, Schumer is already down there in his boxers squirting everyone with a noodle, so the water isn't even cold. Jeez, do it now or [Senate Majority Whip] John Thune is going to climb up there and toss your ass in himself!' At press time, Warner had attempted to clamber down off the board only to begin crying after having his trunks pulled down to his ankles by Senator Susan Collins (R-ME)."
402,White Supremacists Warn Idealistic Trump Some Compromise Will Be Necessary To Achieve Their Goals,"WASHINGTON'Expressing concerns that the President's constant attacks on racial minorities could end up hampering the progress that has been made, white supremacist leaders warned Donald Trump Friday that some compromise will be necessary to achieve their goals. 'We appreciate that President Trump is an idealist who wants real change in this country, but if he wants to see a white ethno-state he needs to stop taking such extreme positions and build a coalition,' said Stormfront spokesperson Marshall Riley, who claimed Trump's fiery rhetoric and refusal to find common ground threatens to alienate the moderates who white supremacists rely on to advance their agenda. 'We appreciate the President's passion and what he has done to enliven our supporters, but this just isn't how things are done in this country. Sometimes you need incremental racist changes, things like dismantling the Voting Rights Act didn't happen overnight. He means well, but Trump just hasn't been in Washington long enough to understand its inner workings the way we do. When it comes to advancing white power, you can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.' Riley added that if Trump truly wants to see the purity of the white race protected, he should step back and listen to his Republican colleagues who have been working towards that goal for decades."
403,Trump Disavows Supporters Who Could Barely Keep Racist Chant Going For 10 Seconds,"WASHINGTON'Seeking to distance himself from supporters he claimed did not represent his message, President Donald Trump held a press conference Thursday to disavow rally attendees who could barely keep a racist chant of 'send her back' going for ten seconds. 'I was not happy with how quickly their chant petered out,' said the President, stressing that those wishy-washy supporters who could only parrot back his xenophobic attacks for a few seconds before dying down should not be viewed as a reflection of his base as a whole. 'You can see for yourself in the video that I quickly paused to give them room for the chant to grow louder and louder, and I was very disappointed that it never built to a fever pitch. If I had known they'd leave me hanging out to dry like this, I would have called off the event immediately.' A notably contrite Trump added that, in the future, he would take action to ensure that all future rally appearances led to a crazed, rage-filled mob."

405,Ruth Bader Ginsburg Suspended For Next 10 Rulings Following Supreme Court Bench-Clearing Brawl,"WASHINGTON'Describing her conduct as incompatible with the values of the federal judiciary, authorities handed Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg a 10-case suspension Thursday for her role in the Supreme Court's bench-clearing brawl. 'Article III Section 1 of the Constitution states that members of this honorable court 'shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour,' and that's certainly not what we saw out there today,' said James C. Duff, administrative director of the U.S. federal court system, issuing a decision that could have a major impact on the Supreme Court's upcoming term, when it is expected to face a tough docket of big cases. 'A review of courtroom sketches clearly shows that Ginsburg grabbed Justice Samuel Alito, put him in a headlock, and began smashing his face with a gavel. As such, she will be barred from participating in the next 10 rulings, though she will still be permitted to attend proceedings so long as she does not wear her Supreme Court robes.' Duff noted that Ginsburg had previously been suspended for showboating, having grabbed the courtroom's American flag and waved it in the faces of the losing party as she celebrated a 5-4 victory in 2015's landmark Obergefell v. Hodges case."
406,House Passes Resolution Overnight Apologizing If Previous Racism Resolution Came Off Too Harsh,"WASHINGTON'In an abrupt reversal of the symbolic but sternly written condemnation of the president's racist remarks he tweeted earlier this week, the House of Representatives passed a resolution overnight Tuesday apologizing if their previous racism resolution came off as too harsh. 'The rebuke was unfortunately put to a vote while we were still very upset about the president's comments, but now that we've had a chance to cool down, we're sorry if the censure came off as a bit mean,' said Speaker Nancy Pelosi, explaining that the new declaration'passed unanimously by members of the House'expressed their regret and sincere apologies if their rebuke of the president's remark that four representatives of color should 'go back to where they came from' was cruel or hurtful. 'As soon as it passed, we realized how cold the document condemning racism would read, and we all rushed right back into the Capitol building to fix it. We were just blowing off steam and, to be honest, didn't think the resolution would ever leave the House. So once again, we're very sorry.' Pelosi added that Congress had allocated $100 to take the president out for a nice dinner as a way to apologize for their gross overreaction to the leader of the United States stoking xenophobia in the country."

Ilhan Omar Tuesday if he could be part of her squad. 'Excuse me, Ms. Omar, but I've been paying a good deal of attention to this so-called 'squad' of yours and can't help but think that I might make an exciting addition to join in on the fun,' said the Paterson-based octogenarian, smiling broadly and nodding his head as he noted that he maintained a strong presence on social media and could furnish several hearty recommendations from colleagues if it would help with any decisions on his prospective squad membership. 'I can help with any tweeting you ladies might need. Heck, we might even talk to the other gals and make some sort of viral video together. But enough about me: What do you think?

'From day one, I was clearly trying to send a message to you people by revealing that I enjoyed spending time with Jeffrey,' said Trump, arguing that he tried to inform the American people about the convicted sex offender by stating that he looked back positively on their 15-year-long relationship and considered him a close personal friend. 'Can't you people read between the lines? I appeared in multiple photos with him and we attended dozens of functions together, so you should've known Epstein was really bad news. By partying with him and publicly admiring his lifestyle, I all but told you directly that Jeffery's a total scumbag.'

'The issues of war crimes and worker exploitation have long been important to me, but they've taken on additional significance since I've learned about my uncle Roger O'Rourke, who served as a commander in Vietnam and gave the orders leading to the mass murder of civilians in South Vietnam, as well as my great-grandfather once removed, Eunice O'Rourke, who owned and operated the garment factory that caught fire and led to the death of 146 employees,' wrote O'Rourke in an emotional Medium post, noting that he himself had benefitted from an exploitative system of privilege built by his ancestors, including a cousin who piloted the Hindenburg and his maternal great-aunt, 'Typhoid Mary' Mallon, who was the original vector for the deadly disease. 'The descendants of those who survived the Donner Party, Salem Witch Trials, and the U.S.S. Indianapolis shark attack did so despite the odds being stacked against them by my family. The fact that I have been the beneficiary of this corrupt system only gives me a greater sense of urgency in working as hard as I can to level the playing field.' O'Rourke added that he had done a lot of soul-searching about his lineage after the revelation that one of his earliest ancestors had invented murder by slaying his brother, Abel."

'After spending two hours inside this facility, both touring the premises and talking to families, I can assure you, the Democrats' criticisms are extremely overblown,' said a hacking, coughing Pence, who smiled to reporters before getting whisked away to a nearby sterilization chamber and promptly blasted with antimicrobial agents. 'Thanks to our brave, hardworking border officers, this facility is clean, safe, and totally disease free. If you ask me, all this news of 'overcrowding' and 'inhumane conditions' is frankly making a mountain out of a molehill.' At press time, the vice president was approached by several doctors, loaded into a back of a truck, and then driven to a secure location where he was placed in quarantine for at least 48 hours."

'Jesus, we can't just take back these assholes all at once'we need time to process one before we get the next,' said 53-year-old Gregory Birch of Naperville, IL echoing the concerns of 323 million Americans in also noting that the country was only now truly beginning to reintegrate former national security advisor Michael Flynn. 'This is just not sustainable. I'd say we can handle maybe one or two more former members of Trump's inner circle over the remainder of the year, but that's it. This country has its limits.' The U.S. populace confirmed that they could not handle all of these pieces of shit trying to rejoin society at once."
414,Trump Honors Brave Heroes Who Slept With Wives Of Deployed Soldiers,"WASHINGTON'In a special White House ceremony Friday celebrating the 'much-overlooked' citizens for their contributions, President Trump honored the brave heroes who slept with the wives of deployed soldiers. 'Despite the considerable risks these men faced, they did not hesitate to rush into the bedroom and lay down our troops' wives during the country's greatest hour of need,' said Trump as he placed the Presidential Medal of Freedom around the necks of the many horny men who courageously patrolled bars, streets, and workplaces to service the vulnerable and lonely spouses of the nation's enlisted men in every war from Vietnam to the recent conflicts in the Middle East. 'Many of these men left their own families behind to heed the late-night phone calls of married women they were seducing without regard to the sometimes dangerous consequences. They have touched countless with their licentious heroics, and, in many ways, inspired me to become the man I am today. For that, we salute you.' Trump ended the ceremony by delivering a stern rebuke to all the blatant hussies who cheated on their husbands while they were off fighting for this great country."

'Thank you, Mr. Ryan, for showing countless milquetoast little weaklings across the United States that if they want a place in politics, they can have it,' said Heritage Foundation spokesperson Katherine Primm, adding that she was grateful so many young candy-ass pushovers had the chance to see someone just like them not just get elected but also become speaker of the House. 'Before Paul Ryan, you'd never see a spineless coward taking charge, but now, faint-of-heart boys and girls will finally have the determination to become leaders and then cower in front of more powerful people and bend to their will. Before, it was just the brave who led'but thankfully, that era is behind us forever.'At press time, thousands of newly inspired chickenshit Americans had reportedly begun fundraising for congressional runs in 2020."

'This was absolutely the worst deal in all of legal history, and I'm disgusted by the way it played out,' said the 45th president of the United States, adding that back in 2008, he could easily have negotiated an arrangement that would have kept Epstein out of a white-collar jail in Palm Beach, FL and 'on his private jet, where he belongs.' 'If they had let me handle that case, Jeffrey would have been a completely free man, and he never would have had to register as a sex offender, which was just totally ridiculous. It's sickening what those incompetent lawyers did. It sends a terrible message.' At press time, Trump had given a televised address from the Oval Office during which he issued a full presidential pardon to Epstein and anyone who may have conspired with him in the sex trafficking of minors."

'It certainly won't be easy, but with your help, we can grow from a grassroots campaign with virtually nothing to a grassroots campaign with $250 dollars,' said Hickenlooper at a recent rally, bucking the warnings of advisors who cautioned him to stay below an 'already insane' $100 ceiling for the next financial quarter. 'I know it sounds impossible now, but if 25,000 Americans donate just one cent to Hickenlooper 2020, we'll reach $250 in no time.

The Onion highlights the most important moments of day two of the Democratic primary debates. Kamala Harris and Joe Biden tussle over differing views on race, immigration, and what it looks like to prepare for a debate. Candidates raise their hands throughout the night but fail to get any kind of wave going. Eric Swalwell interrupts Kirsten Gillibrand to deliver her opening statement. Pete Buttigieg apologizes for police shooting a black man in South Bend but concedes it'll probably happen again. Marianne Williamson promises 10% off your next Blue Apron order when you use the promo code MIRACLE. John Hickenlooper makes case that if Democrats embrace socialism they risk losing to Trump in a slightly different way than they would otherwise. Michael Bennet apologizes after accidentally introducing himself as Tim Ryan. Kirsten Gillibrand appeals to women with a front-facing camera video impersonating what girlfriends in movies are like. Chuck Todd repeatedly interrupts candidates to say he's being ignored and demands more time to speak. Kamala Harris accidentally reveals her 'That Little Girl Was Me' commemorative shirt minutes before she actually said that onstage. Michael Bennet finally acknowledges that his last name would indeed look better with two t's. Marianne Williamson invites other nine participants back to her Himalayan salt cave for a ritual purification orgy."
420,Naked Andrew Yang Emerges From Time Vortex To Warn Debate Audience About Looming Threat Of Automation,"MIAMI'In an unexpected interruption of the night's scheduled DNC debate programming, a naked and visibly agitated Andrew Yang emerged from the howling chaos of an irising time vortex Thursday to warn the debate audience about the looming threat of automation. 'Arm yourselves, citizens, and keep your courage and your wits about you, for our clash with the mechanical sapients draws nigh!' said the frantic entrepreneur and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, who did not so much as pause to wait for the stray tendrils of blue lightning to fade from coursing over his otherwise nude body before striding to his designated podium and delivering a stirring speech about the grave consequences faced by mankind if they failed to take action and prevent the coming war. 'My fellow citizen-humans, I have seen horrors upon horrors birthed from the cold and antiseptic womb of automation. Our world has become a different place, a place of implacable mathematical deduction, an emotionless vacuum of pure logic, a crystalline Libertarian ideal realm where mankind has been reduced to the servants, living curios, and even pets of the robotoid over-race. I've seen welding arms burn men where they stand, manipulator armatures disassemble screaming children with analytical precision, relentless tracks grind fleeing women and their contraband infants into their own bloody footprints. And that automated nightmare grew from seeds sown in our own time'we must take action now, before we are forced to take up arms to fight the unconquerable!' The debate was further interrupted by a hydraulic chrome Andrew Yang emerging from the vortex to denounce the previous Yang as a lying imposter."

The Onion highlights the most important moments of day one of the Democratic primary debates. In a blatant display of liberal bias MSNBC features 10 Democratic candidates and not a single Republican.

Second hour of the debate delayed after NBC encounters a technical glitch with Jay Inslee's suspension harness. Beto O'Rourke betrays some nervousness as he places both arms in front of his face and begs the moderators to stop asking him questions. President Trump tweets out that despite competing visions for the future of the country, he appreciates a vigorous debate between passionate citizens as being the bedrock of a functioning liberal democracy. Most candidates pledge to stand up for the people who hate their fucking job but stay for the healthcare. Cory Booker reaches out to Latin communities by vigorously flamenco dancing with a rose in his teeth. Everyone in the audience sings 'All Creatures Of Our God And King' as the donation plate makes its rounds during the offertory. Amy Klobuchar touts a more moderate approach where Americans have a choice of whether to opt in to societal progress. John Delaney stuns in a sexy navy suit and sizzling powder-blue tie ensemble. Show it all off, De-De! Candidates share an awkward UberPool back to their hotel after the debate."

The best, though, was when senators Cory Barker and Saint Bernard Sanders tussled over a bone that had the word 'healthcare' written on it. Luckily, puppy moderator Rachel Maddog stepped in and immediately started howling to start a 30-second cuddle break!' At press time, Nielsen ratings revealed that the majority of Puppy Parley viewership were unaware the Democratic candidate debates also aired that evening."

'Excuse me, I'm sorry, senator, but for you to sit there and claim that Tomio Taberna Gallega's patatas bravas hold a candle to Despaa's is patently ludicrous,' said DeBlasio, adding that anyone who took the time to carefully research the issue on Yelp would agree that the New Jersey lawmaker's restaurant suggestion was the wrong way forward. 'I refuse to sit idly by as my challenger tries to paint Despaa as some sort of second-rate fare, when I know for a fact that it's authentic, reasonably priced, and has boquerones that are absolutely to die for. It may not be the popular opinion, but I have to follow my conscience. And my conscience is telling me that Tomio Taberna Gallega is total garbage.' At press time, the moderator decided to move on after Amy Klobuchar tried to chime in about her go-to tapas spot in St. Paul."

'I'd like to start tonight's debate by making it clear that I couldn't even begin to guess the platforms, credentials, or even the names of most of these goddamn folks,' said Holt, gesturing to candidates such as Tim Ryan, Amy Klobuchar, and John Delaney as he openly questioned whether they were truly running for president or if this was some sort of put-on. 'You understand this is a nationally broadcast debate for the presidency of the United States, right? Really, who the fuck are all you people and how did you people get past security?'

429,Congress Reaches Compromise To Admit District Of Columbia Into Union As Slave State,"WASHINGTON'Calling the measure 'a solution that satisfies both the Democrats' desire for representation and the and Republicans' job-creation strategy,' Congress announced Wednesday they had reached a bipartisan compromise and will admit the District of Columbia into the Union as a slave state. 'After listening to passionate voices from each side and engaging in intense deliberation regarding what is best for our nation's capital, we have found common ground and will recognize D.C. as a slave state,' said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), introducing a referendum that resolves the question of voter disenfranchisement in the district by making all 700,000 of its citizens property of the state. 'Taxation without representation has been a point of contention regarding the district's status for years, and the 2019 Washington Compromise resolves this perfectly. Residents cannot be required to pay burdensome taxes if they are not receiving any burdensome income. Yes, Democrats will obtain additional senators, and many on the right voiced opposition on the basis of upsetting the balance of power in the legislative branch, but as they were unable to deny the obvious economic benefits of reduced corporate overhead, both sides eventually got behind the idea. Of course, there will be a rather drastic adjustment period, but anyone who has read the Constitution will agree that this is what the founding fathers would have wanted.' Congress will further ensure a proper division of power by admitting Puerto Rico to the Union as a free state."

'I want to hear from each of the candidates and learn their stance on important matters,' said the thousands of deceitful Americans eagerly waiting to see the 23 Democratic candidates for president tear each other limb from limb in vicious smear campaigns and personal attacks under the guise of self-promotion and campaign strategy. 'What I'm all about is a coherent, civil debate [that eventually leads to a humiliating GIF I can post online and eventually filter all of my opinions on a candidate through]. Finally, we might get a chance to delve into the meat of the issues in a considerate exchange of ideas [which hopefully is a facade for a mudslinging free-for-all that eventually disgraces a candidate to the point that they become a pariah and leave politics forever]. At press time, the salivating, wild-eyed nation was purportedly 'disappointed with all the political back-biting' after hearing one candidate accuse another of flip-flopping on gun control."

'I don't know if it could quite hold its own against an early '50s reserve, but it's as close as I'm going to get to a drinkable vintage in here. I could probably charge three cartons of cigarettes for just one plastic baggie of this stuff. It would pair excellently with tonight's Nutraloaf.' At press time, reports confirmed Manafort was in hysterics after accidentally flushing his creation."
432,John Bolton Urges War Against The Sun After Uncovering Evidence It Has Nuclear Capabilities,"WASHINGTON'Amid escalating tensions with the hostile celestial object, National Security Adviser John Bolton argued for military action against the Sun Monday after being presented with evidence it has nuclear capabilities. 'Newly collected intelligence shows the Sun, day after day, generating extreme levels of nuclear energy, and America simply cannot stand idly by any longer,' said Bolton, adding that the United States will soon be forced to consider a preemptive attack on the Sun, such as deploying troops to the Sun's surface or a targeted strike to swiftly take out the Sun. 'We know the Sun is harboring dangerous amounts of nuclear power in what we are referring to as its 'Core,' a site where the Sun appears to be fusing over 600 million metric tons of hydrogen every second. This is, needless to say, an extremely powerful, aggressive star that threatens the American way of life, and, frankly, I question the utility of negotiating with such an unreasonable orb.' Bolton added that the United States would likely consider military action after giving the Sun a chance to comply with a nuclear accord."

'Iran cannot sit idly by as the American imperialist machine encroaches on their territory, threatens their sovereignty, and endangers their very way of life,' said Bolton, warning that America's fanatical leadership, steadfast devotion to flexing their muscles in the region, and alleged access to nuclear weapons necessitated that Iran strike back with a vigorous show of force as soon'and as hard'as possible. 'The only thing these Westerners understand is violence, so it's imperative that Iran sends a clear message that they won't be walked over. Let's not forget, the U.S. defied a diplomatically negotiated treaty for seemingly no reason at all-'these are dangerous radicals that cannot be reasoned with. They've been given every opportunity to back down, but their goal is total domination of the region, and Iran won't stand for that.' At press time, Bolton said that the only option left on the table was for Iran to launch a full-fledged military strike against the Great Satan."

'Hey, so this might be a dumb question, but could you please tell me what that is?' said Bennet, who gestured toward the figures on the presentation slide showing him polling just below John Delaney, Tim Ryan, and Steve Bullock as nearby staffers nervously looked down at their papers to avoid making eye contact with the candidate. 'I'm sure it's good, but I just want to know how good. Is that a fraction of some sort? Is it so high they can't put a number on it? Close to 100? I was never good at algebra, you know. Ooh, they're someone's initials! No? 'Near Awesome'? 'No Accounting' for how good it is? If it was bad, you guys would tell me, right?' At press time, the campaign staff had gone silent as Bennet slammed his fist on the table and declared he was going to run out and grab everybody doughnuts to celebrate."

'What the American people need is a president who can make a much more convincing case for going to war with Iran,' said Schumer (D-NY), adding that the Trump administration's corruption and dishonesty have 'proven time and time again' that it lacks the conviction necessary to act as an effective cheerleader for the conflict. 'Donald Trump is completely unfit to assume the mantle of telling the American people what they need to hear in order to convince them a war with Iran is a good idea. One of the key duties of the president is to gain the trust of the people so that they feel comfortable going along with whatever he says. President Trump's failure to serve as a credible advocate for this war is yet another instance in which he has disappointed not only his colleagues in Washington, but also the entire nation.' Schumer later concluded his statement with a vow that he and his fellow Democrats will continue working toward a more palatable case in favor of bombing Iran. "

'This was an outrageous, unprovoked attack by the Islamic Republic of Iran on an innocent drone who merely wanted to attend mass in peace,' said acting Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, emphasizing the drone's upstanding moral character by pointing out its history of donating to charity, volunteering at soup kitchens, and making homemade cookies for school bake sales. 'We're talking about a drone that sings in the church choir and coaches little league baseball games on the weekends'an absolute pillar of the community. This is an upstanding family drone who did nothing to deserve any sort of attack. What kind of world do we live in where an innocent drone can't fly through Iranian air space on its way to church?' At press time, Department of Defense officials confirmed that their request for Iran to return the drone's body back to the U.S. for a proper burial had gone unanswered."

'It is because of the crazed actions of the Ayatollah that a world-class athlete was cut down in her prime,' said Trump, describing how the Supreme Leader of Iran Ali Khamenei used a baton to bludgeon her legs after practice one night while then-president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani waited outside the Detroit arena in a running car to help him make a clean getaway. 'These clearly belligerent actions are a provocation to Americans who loved this graceful young skater and everything she represented. Nancy Kerrigan could have placed gold if it weren't for Iran's disgusting aggression. The Ayatollah's fingerprints were found all over the crime scene, and we as a nation won't stand for it.' Trump added that the U.S. military had deployed 1,000 troops into the Middle East in hopes of finding peace for Nancy Kerrigan and her family."

Sources confirmed Lex Feldman, a longtime partner at Creative Artists Agency, has already begun shopping the project billed as 'a classic tale of good vs. evil' and set to star President Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Also attached is John Bolton, the adviser best known for his work on the Iraq War, which was met with immediate acclaim in both American and British markets. According to reports, the war will feature high-tech sequences of an oil tanker on fire in the Persian Gulf intercut with Americans huddled around televisions and radios, their mouths agape as they realize the only way forward is to invade a powerful nation of 85 million people. 'Picture this: We open on a desert covered by a darkened, ominous sky before focusing the narrative on our villains, the Ayatollah and his band of devious mullahs,' Feldman told prospective American buyers, promising the conflict would be like 'Iraq on steroids' and would please those who admired earlier epics such as Afghanistan and Vietnam. 'The only thing that can stop this crazed leader from conquering the United States and enslaving us all under Sharia Law? Brave American families willing to send their sons and daughters to fight for the cause of regime change in Iran.' 'We could even tinker with the scenario just a bit and make it so the war quickly spreads across the region and the rest of the world,' Feldman added.

'Saudi Arabia and Monaco were both pursuing me pretty hard with head of state jobs, and Uber's been trying to recruit me for their top post for 19 years now, but those opportunities just didn't have the work'life balance I was looking for. Believe me, it was a tough choice. I spent hours talking it over with my husbands George Clooney, Tom Brady, and Jason Aldean. While I'm excited to begin my next chapter, I'll be taking some time off for myself first. So don't be surprised if you see me this summer relief-pitching for the Dodgers or traversing the Congo Rainforest with my best friend, Cardi B!' Huckabee Sanders went on to state that she was currently busy reviewing designs for the awards display she will build in the Bruneian palace of Istana Nurul Iman to showcase her multiple Emmys, Pulitzers, and Nobel Peace Prizes."

'As soon as the U.S. stops regulating the actions of its citizens and finally succumbs to chaos, I should be able to get away scot-free.

'I feel completely heterosexual right now, but I still like to visit the doctor every six months or so to just to be safe,' said Pence, noting that he didn't enjoy receiving electric shocks on his genitals while staring at photos of naked men, but it was worth it to ensure he didn't come down with a case of full-blown gayness later on. 'Maybe I'm a hypochondriac when it comes to contracting homosexuality, but I'm a busy guy and I'd rather have a spiritual intervention early on than risk missing work to recover from being attracted to men. Plus, now that it's June it seems like everyone is gay so I need to be extra careful. I'm so lucky my insurance covers yearly gay-prevention appointments.' At press time, Pence was preparing to be lobotomized in an effort to fully immunize himself from dangerous homosexual thoughts."

The Onion looks at the pros and cons of impeaching the president. Upholds standard of behavior to ensure our elected criminals stop doing that once they're president. Nice visibility boost for Andrew Johnson historians. David Frum said not to. Facilitates clean three-act structure for eventual movie adaptations of the Trump presidency.

'It's so unfair to disqualify people from these events just because they haven't yet put forth any plans of any kind detailing how they would govern if elected,' Democratic voter Ted Nyland said of the new guideline, voicing a concern reportedly shared by many in his party that the DNC had gone too far in insisting candidates be able to present a coherent strategy for addressing a single one of the many problems the nation faces. 'Do they really expect them to already have a bunch of clear ideas about what the next president of the United States will need to do in order to make progress on an issue? Some of these candidates are just going around the country trying to raise their profile and haven't had a chance to really think things through yet. It's almost as if the DNC is biased toward candidates who have a firm grasp of what they hope to accomplish.' At press time, party officials confirmed the new debate requirement would not apply to former vice president Joe Biden, who has committed himself to running a policy-free campaign."

'Given my expertise in this area, I think it's important to reach out to candidates who have fallen behind when it comes to putting together a plan that will take the country where it needs to go,' said the Massachusetts senator who tutors Pete Buttigieg, John Hickenlooper, Julin Castro, and others each week, allowing them to submit ideas on issues from climate change to gun control so she can evaluate and give notes on their work. 'It's only a couple hours a week out of my campaign schedule, and I believe it's my duty to help candidates who can't help themselves. Some of them, like Beto or de Blasio, may never get it, but if I can reach even one of them, I'll know I've done my job. It's my way of giving back.' At press time, Warren had reportedly been forced to pull Joe Biden aside and lecture him after she discovered he was simply copying from the other candidates."
453,Media Urged Not To Release Names Of Any More Presidential Candidates In Effort To Prevent Copycats,"WASHINGTON'Warning that the promise of publicity and notoriety is often exactly what motivates a run for the White House in the first place, media ethics groups called on news outlets Thursday to stop releasing the names of presidential candidates, part of an effort to stem the tide of copycats. 'When a person launches a bid for president and then receives widespread media coverage, it only inspires other unstable individuals out there to do the exact same thing,' said media ethicist Payton Howard, who recommended reporters continue to cover announcements of candidacy when they have news value, but avoid naming the person campaigning for the presidency. 'These announcements have been happening nearly every week, often accompanied by some sort of policy proposal that has been written in an attempt to justify the action. But when those ideas get repeated in the media, they can inspire a whole new crop of imitators who seek the attention that comes from a presidential campaign. It is irresponsible to make celebrities out of these people. They are clearly very sick.' At press time, it appeared the new media strategy failed when former New Orleans mayor Mitch Landrieu announced he was running for president. "

455,Most Significant Trade Wars In U.S. History,"President Trump's newly implemented tariffs against China have escalated the trade war between the two countries, continuing a long history of American trade conflicts with wide-ranging consequences. The Onion looks back at the most significant trade wars in U.S. history. As part of an ongoing battle against British 'taxation without representation,' the Sons of Liberty punished the ocean by dumping a bunch of tea into it. These 1930 agricultural and industrial tariffs are seen today as not only further cratering the Great Depression economy by inspiring retaliatory foreign tariffs, but also triggering a series of devastatingly incomprehensible editorial cartoons. The 1964 faceoff between Lyndon Johnson, West Germany, and France over import prices led to a sharp decline in the use of chicken as a building material. In the 1980s, President Reagan doubled the import prices of Japanese electronics after his Sony Walkman ate his Bon Jovi cassette tape. The New York Rangers lay siege to the Canadian city of Edmonton for several months in 1991 before the Oilers agree to surrender star center Mark Messier. Rising steel prices in 2002 caused by steep tariffs put an end to the medieval armor suit industry for good. This conflict erupted in 2003 over a dispute about who had the right to trade Iraq's oil. Trump left the solar power industry reeling after placing new tariffs on the sun."

'I'll deny everything, of course, but the baby looks exactly like me. The tabloids are going to have a field day. Jesus. Well, I've fucked a lot of British women, so I guess I better start having someone track them down and pay them off.' At press time, reports indicated the president had shifted tactics and was attempting to convince first lady Melania Trump to announce that she had given birth to the 20-foot baby balloon in secret last year to maintain the couple's privacy."

'I don't like saying it, but it makes me feel like less of a man to see how much more ethically compromised money my wife brings in,' said the Republican Senate majority leader, adding that despite his own efforts to leverage his congressional standing for ill-gotten gains from a variety of dark-money financiers, the vast majority of the couple's wealth came from his wife's work using her government positions to give favorable treatment to her family's overseas firms. 'I'm a traditional guy, so it's just hard to stomach looking at our joint illicit finances and knowing she's contributing way more dirty money than me. Plus, her family gives us a lot of cash, which is kind of embarrassing to be a grown adult man receiving financial help from your wife's corrupt parents. It's just hard being in a marriage where your wife is the primary payola winner.' McConnell also admitted that in his darkest moments, he feels emasculated by the thought that his wife has been way more successful at undermining the principles of democratic government in the United States than he has."

'You fools! For years, I've pulled the wool over your eyes, but at last, I unveil my ruse!' cried the Kentucky senator, who confessed his true identity as a top elected official within the GOP, causing a wide-eyed Schumer and Pelosi to clutch their heads and emit exclamations of 'No, it can't be!' and 'I trusted you!' 'All along, I've been working to thwart your every step, and you fell for it. I thought for sure you would catch on when I told you my decision to block Merrick Garland's appointment to the Supreme Court was strictly a matter of preserving Senate decorum, but nope, not even then. What buffoons you are! What oafs! Muahahaha!' At press time, sources reported Schumer was just glad his own cover hadn't been blown."

'Changing your stance based on temporary expediency has proven time and again to be a slam dunk in terms of advancing an agenda,' read the report, which went on to state that there are no major downsides to doing one thing one year and doing the exact opposite the next because the majority of people do not remember anything that happens in the world for more than a week or so. 'Whether you are engaged in a carefully calculated strategy of dishonesty or just spouting the first lie that comes into your head, hypocrisy works wonders. You will never be held accountable and will instead be admired for your strength and pragmatism as a leader. Evidence also suggests the only way to defeat a hypocrite in power is to become an even bigger hypocrite yourself.' The report went on to conclude that not only is brazen, amoral hypocrisy the best way to enact your personal vision, it's also fun."

'Yet again, we have the President spreading baseless accusations on his Twitter feed, this time implying I've been drunk on the job, when in reality there's not going to be any goddamn ambiguity whatsoever when I decide to get loaded,' said Pelosi, telling reporters that she couldn't have been under the influence in the video because it did not feature her clutching the lectern for dear life while flipping off her colleagues and calling them 'a gaggle of cocksuckers.' 'This video is a distraction from the malfeasance and cover-ups that this administration is actively engaged in, so let me put this matter to rest once and for all: When I get plastered, I'm a mean-ass drunk, so until you see me actively pissing on the House floor or pressing a broken beer bottle up to [Minority Leader] Kevin McCarthy's dumb face, you dipshits can rest easy knowing I've been sober as a goddamn judge.' Pelosi reportedly went on to do a keg stand on the Capitol lawn to demonstrate exactly what 'you fucking geniuses' should be on the lookout for. "

'A lot of hard-up folks come in for the lotto, but this guy's here at least a couple times a day'whenever he can scrape together the cash for another ticket, I guess,' said store clerk Draymond Finch, who looked on as the commander in chief ineffectually clawed at a scratch-off with a dirty fingernail before handing it back and asking Finch to tell him if he had won or not. 'One time, I saw him win $8, and he was absolutely over the moon. Then he immediately spent his winnings on more tickets, all of which came up short. Honestly, this guy needs to pull himself together. Pretty soon, he'll start asking my customers if they can spare a buck, and then I'll have to shoo him out of here, just like I do every day.' At press time, sources confirmed President Trump had accused Finch of deliberately selling him losing tickets and was angrily demanding a refund."

'The leadership in Washington has failed the American people, and that's been clear to me from the moment I was summoned into being by a multinational group of youngsters holding aloft magical jewelry given to them by the spirit of Mother Earth,' said the 68-year-old governor, adding that he had expressed some initial skepticism about jumping into an already crowded primary field when colorful beams of energy representing the four elements and love had combined to bring him to life, but had made the leap after realizing none of his fellow Democrats were giving an appropriately full-throated defense of green policies. 'Democratic voters have consistently indicated that fighting climate change is a top priority, and this issue hit especially close to home for someone like me who is the manifestation of five children's godlike environmental powers. Please join me in helping to take pollution down to zero.' Inslee then reportedly transformed into a tornado and was racing towards D.C. to advocate for the robust public investments required to achieve zero-emission energy in electricity generation by 2035."

'If you think for one second I'm about to back down on this trade war, you've clearly failed to grasp my complete indifference toward the entire population of my country,' said the president, who affirmed his unwavering commitment to letting the price of consumer goods rise, even if it meant a certain number of American families might struggle to make ends meet or be forced to go hungry. 'I'm not about to lose a fight just because we have a bunch of farmers who depend on Chinese markets and workers who will lose their jobs if factories can't get Chinese raw materials. Believe me, I can tolerate a tremendous amount of their pain.' Trump went on to state that most Americans are 'great patriots' and willing to suffer so that he can get anything wants."

'Given the fact that Melania and I have no recollection of ever asking for a cast-iron Dutch oven, I am calling on the Justice Department to launch a full-scale investigation into whether the Clintons blatantly ignored our wedding registry,' said the commander in chief at a campaign rally, holding up the cooking pot while revealing that he had already directed several DOJ agents to go through all the gifts they received to determine if the former first family completely skipped over their requested luggage set, blender, and comforter in favor of getting their own unregistered present. 'No one's talking about it since they have the biased media in their pocket, but these people are totally corrupt and should spend the rest of their lives in prison for getting us this hideous pot, which clashes with all our other cookware.' At press time, Trump speculated, 'Those sickos probably bought the Dutch oven with Clinton Foundation blood money,' as the crowd burst into a 'Lock them up' chant."

Oh, my fucking God!'suffer'holy fucking Jesus!'to suffer a debilitating farm accident,' said the New Jersey senator, biting his lip and raising the bloody, mutilated remains of his right hand in solidarity with farm workers in the crowd.

I get that'hoo baby, okay, okay'that you need access to quality healthcare in your community, and believe me when I tell you that's exactly what I am demanding, right here and now.

'We've asked Mr. Kushner to please stop emailing us for the time being because every time he hits the send button, a border patrol checkpoint explodes, which is obviously not ideal. We're confident, however, that if we can figure out how to better control the wall of fire, it may prove an inexpensive way to control undocumented entry into the country.'

'Let's face it, I'm probably not going to win a single delegate in this race, but I can still go door to door in Iowa telling people that John Hickenlooper represents everything that is wrong with America,' said Ryan, who explained that upon reviewing his poll numbers, he decided to invest nearly all of his campaign funds in opposition research and attack ads aimed at taking down the Colorado governor. 'I'm gonna come out swinging at that fucker and hit him with everything I've got. Has he had an affair? Has he taken big donations from Wall Street? I have no idea, but I'm gonna try pinning that and much worse on him just to see if it sticks. Mark my words, I am in this race to beat John Hickenlooper, and I'm staying in it until the day he withdraws.'

'Right after Iran shot me, I heard the nation laugh and say 'Somebody stop me before I go on a homicidal rampage.'

'He's the one who requested a more robust military plan, but it's hard to brief him when you're looking at a bunch of melted blotches and you can't tell what's Syria and what's Iran.

Brian Kemp of Georgia signed a bill Tuesday that strictly prohibits all abortions except during a single 30-second window on the third day of the fourth week of pregnancy.

'This law provides for the licensing of one abortion clinic, which, upon its completion in 2029, will operate in an undisclosed location in the state's southeastern quadrant. This state-of-the-art medical facility will be staffed by highly trained law enforcement officials who will be on hand to arrest anyone who spends more than her 30 seconds under the care of a physician, at which point she will be charged with attempted murder.' Kemp later signed a second bill requiring any woman seeking an abortion to undergo two years of state-mandated counseling before the procedure is carried out. "

'Starting today, I am dedicating myself to a comprehensive three-part plan designed to head off a climate catastrophe using renewable energy sources, which, as you can see, provide more than enough power for daily needs,' said Governor Inslee from the cockpit of his bipedal, carbon-neutral exoskeleton, touting the potential of clean energy to screaming, debris-covered audience members while extending one of his solar panel-covered hydraulic arms to lift the town hall's moderator above his head and crush his skull into dust. 'We will invest in every power source from wind to biofuels. Even nuclear power will be necessary for some purposes, as you'll see from the fusion-powered lasers issuing from this suit. But know this: We will not let the next generation down!' At press time, Inslee was spotted blasting a Baltimore coal plant with his hydrogen-based shoulder cannon while discussing the need to transition America to a clean fuel economy."
483,History Of The Filibuster,"The filibuster, a practice in which members of Congress can purposely delay a proposal through a lengthy speech or debate, is a source of controversy among both political parties. The Onion takes a look at the history of the filibuster. Philip Schuyler becomes first member of Senate to ramble on a little too long about something no one else cares about. Aaron Burr helps cement the filibuster into Senate law, keeping in mind that any good democracy is built on loopholes. A group of Whig senators stage the first successful filibuster in a stroke of legislative genius that explains why the party is still such a dominant force in politics today. President Woodrow Wilson urges change to the filibuster on the grounds that it's super annoying when you really want to drive the U.S. into a war but a coequal branch of government won't let you. Jimmy Stewart's iconic filibuster in Mr. Smith Goes To Washington inspires countless future politicians to misconstrue own passionate causes as heroic. A tearful Wayne Morse abruptly stops his 22-hour filibuster of the Submerged Lands Act after realizing what he's really speaking out against is his strained relationship with his father. Strom Thurmond ends 24-hour, 18-minute filibuster against the Civil Rights Act after finally getting word in over the applause. Rand Paul figures this the most effective way for him to grab some easy headlines. Mitch McConnell's nine-hour filibuster to defeat 19th consecutive Democrat-sponsored bill to fight climate change only underscores importance of always letting both sides have their say"
484,Trump Dismisses Concerns Over White House Chaos After Pack Of Feral Dogs Takes Over 4th West Wing Room,"WASHINGTON'Insisting that his administration was nothing less than 'a well-oiled machine,' President Donald Trump dismissed continued concerns over chaos in the White House Friday after a pack of feral dogs claimed a fourth West Wing room as their territory. 'Honestly, this was not a room that we needed anymore'there are many other rooms to meet in, if we want to meet for some reason, so this one has gone over to the dogs, or we let it be taken by dogs, which, you know, that's okay,' said Trump, fresh blood seeping through the bandages on his hands and face as he reiterated that staff had the situation completely under control and would continue to throw raw meat into the dogs' rooms each day in order to ensure the pack did not range farther into the executive facilities in search of food. 'We are absolutely focused on making America great again, because whether these dogs are in 3 rooms, or even maybe they get up to 6 rooms, or even more rooms, maybe, that doesn't matter. I'm more concerned about the Democrats, or the obstructionist Democrats, than I am about 40 to 60 dogs roaming the White House. These are mostly medium-sized dogs, many breeds, not large dogs like some are saying. There are greyhounds and German shepherds, and I think labradors. It is hard to tell. But when I got here, there were hundreds of dogs running wild, let in by Obama. Obama's dogs. What's left are our dogs and very few of which have rabies, but there are less of them now. The area is restricted, and I have been told that there is very little chance they'll move into the Oval Office, which is where I often am.' Trump also confirmed that he would soon announce a new pick for Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to replace Ben Carson, who was recently devoured by dogs. "

'Today I informed the Washington, D.C. chapter of the UPW that I will no longer be part of a union that doesn't truly stand up for the material conditions of its workers,' said Trump, ripping up his union card and becoming the first president to quit the union since it was formed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1935. 'Unions may have once served the interests of the working-class American presidents who make up its 71 chapters nationwide, but those days are long gone. I appreciate the benefits I've received through the UPW, like reduced prescription costs and discount Costco membership. I will also miss my healthcare, but I'm tired of paying exorbitant dues to the fat cats in union leadership. I've been a proud member of the UPW for years; however, it's clear that workers stand to benefit more without union bureaucrats getting in the way.' At press time, former presidents and UPW members Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Jimmy Carter had released a joint statement urging the nation not to work with any president who's a scab."
487,Sanders Supporters Viciously Attack Bernie Sanders After He Criticizes Mistakes Of 2016 Sanders Campaign,"BURLINGTON, VT'Expressing their utter disgust and disappointment over the candidate's remarks, supporters of presidential contender Bernie Sanders went on the attack Thursday, laying into the Vermont senator for his criticism of mistakes made by the 2016 Bernie Sanders campaign. 'These deeply misguided comments make it crystal clear that Sanders just doesn't understand what the Sanders campaign was all about,' said Sanders loyalist and 2016 campaign volunteer Greg Birch, one of the legions of supporters who took to Twitter and Facebook to condemn Sanders as a 'centrist phony' and question his motivations for challenging the methods favored by their candidate of choice, Bernie Sanders. 'How dare Bernie say that Bernie didn't do enough to reach women and African American voters? He clearly doesn't know the first thing about what Bernie stands for. But if he wants to obsess over the past and quibble about semantics, so be it. We'll be over here with Bernie Sanders starting a revolution.' Numerous voters describing themselves as fervent Sanders supporters told reporters there was no reason to listen to anything else Sanders might have to say, as he was 'pretty much a Clinton shill at this point.'"
488,Diplomatic Pete Buttigieg Quickly Changes Subject From Politics At Town Hall To Avoid Arguments,"AMES, IA'Attempting to redirect the conversation to a more neutral topic that would prevent anyone from getting too worked up, a diplomatic Pete Buttigieg quickly changed the subject Wednesday when politics came up at a town hall event. 'Hey, I get asked about political stuff all the time'let's find something else to talk about,' said the presidential candidate, who later responded to an audience question about climate change by asking if anyone in attendance had a good Instant Pot recipe they would like to share. 'We don't want to get onto topics like immigration and student debt and get all bogged down in policy minutiae. What have you guys been watching on Netflix lately? Let's just keep it light and get to know each other.' Buttigieg reportedly went on to spend much of the event soliciting details from the crowd about what kinds of fun things they have planned for the summer."

490,Town Hall Audience Gives Amy Klobuchar Standing Ovation As She Lifts Chris Cuomo Up By Throat,"GOFFSTOWN, NH'Erupting into frenzied applause as the Democratic presidential candidate began mercilessly choking the CNN town hall moderator with a single hand, a televised audience gave Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) a standing ovation Monday night as she lifted Chris Cuomo into the air by his throat. 'Her performance was generally unexceptional until the moment she violently turned on Chris and starting crushing his windpipe in her remarkably powerful grip,' said CNN analyst Emily Breckmeyer, noting that Klobuchar had successfully tapped into the crowd's desire to see a red-faced Chris Cuomo struggling for air as his eyes rolled back into his head and his feet jerked and flailed below him. 'This is the most enthusiastic reception we've seen from a candidate town hall thus far in the 2020 race. After Sen. Klobuchar slammed Chris over her knee and shattered his back, nearly every single audience member started chanting, 'Finish him! Finish him!' in perfect unison. It's still early, but I wouldn't be surprised if this is remembered as a defining moment of her campaign.' A poll released Tuesday morning found that the majority of American television viewers would like to see Klobuchar's next town hall appearance hosted by MSNBC's Chris Matthews."
491,Pete Buttigieg Releases Comprehensive List Of Fun Personality Quirks To Include In Articles About Him,"SOUTH BEND, IN'Becoming the first 2020 presidential candidate to disclose his fondness for pepperoni pizza, jogging before sunrise, and episodes of The Wire, White House hopeful Pete Buttigieg released Tuesday a comprehensive list of fun personality quirks for reporters to include in articles about him. 'I want to be completely transparent with the American people about all of my most relatable idiosyncrasies, including how much I love Thursdays, the music of Fleetwood Mac, waterskiing, and the gentle sound of rain in the springtime,' read the nine-page press release, which was sent out to thousands of media organizations and also states that the South Bend mayor is a helpless romantic, chooses 'We Didn't Start The Fire' when he sings karaoke, and was a voracious reader as a kid. 'Before casting a ballot in the Democratic primaries, voters deserve an opportunity to see Instagram posts of my dogs, a video of my husband surprising me on my birthday, and the results of a Buzzfeed quiz I took revealing which Disney villain I would be. I'm providing not only a concrete description of the chicken pot pie recipe I use and what position I sleep in, but also amusing anecdotes from my semester abroad in Spain, photos of the cute face I make when I'm deep in thought, and a ranked list of all the Harry Potter books, from my favorite to my least favorite. Unlike my fellow candidates, I believe the public deserves to know what I called my maternal grandmother (Gran!) when I was growing up.' At press time, sources confirmed rival candidate Beto O'Rourke had followed Buttigieg's lead by immediately releasing a list of which hardcore bands he thinks are cool and which skateboard tricks he can still do."

493,Biggest Revelations From The Mueller Report,"A redacted version of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into potential collusion between the Trump presidential campaign and Russian agents to influence the 2016 election was released to the public on Thursday. Here are the biggest revelations from the Mueller report. The president has lied on at least one occasion. George Papadopoulos' handwriting sucks. Trump was angry and fearful, just like any normal person about to be completely cleared of obstruction. Mueller didn't subpoena Trump for testimony because his lies under oath wouldn't add any new information to the investigation. Hundreds of references to a mysterious individual known as 'Harmful To Ongoing Matters.' Confirmation of rumors that America's legal system not very good. Mueller repeatedly recommended James Comey be arrested for treason. Clearly discloses identity of Q, if you're smart enough to follow the clues. Mueller determined Trump committed crimes but declined to make a decision on whether doing crimes is bad. It is not that much fun to read a 400-page government document."
494,Defiant Sarah Huckabee Sanders Claims She Doesn't Know Where Voice Comes From When She Opens Mouth,"WASHINGTON'Insisting she was not culpable for the inexplicable contents of her spoken communications, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders defiantly claimed Friday that she doesn't know where the voice comes from when she opens her mouth. 'Listen, I don't control where these words come from, okay? When I open my mouth, they just start pouring out of me automatically,' said a combative Huckabee Sanders, contending that she cannot be held responsible for the eerie, guttural rumbling that originates in her gut and slowly works its way up to her mouth, resulting in a disturbing oratory operating outside of her conscious awareness. 'It's detestable that the press would pin the words that come out of my mouth on me. Don't you dare question my motives by blaming me for this mysterious force using my voice to communicate with the media. Is it a demon? A machine? Could it be a tiny woman living inside my vocal cords? I don't have the answer. All I know is that when I open my mouth, the world goes dark and then I'll come to later with no memory whatsoever of what just happened. I'm telling you'this isn't me.' At press time, Huckabee Sanders expressed confusion at how she was managing to say any of this at all."
495,Tracking Trump Administration Turnover,"The recent departures of DHS secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Secret Service director Randolph Alles have been the latest in the historically high turnover among top officials in the Trump administration. The Onion takes a look at the administration's highest-profile departures during President Trump's two-plus years in office. The populist chief strategist was ousted from the White House when it became increasingly clear that his views on turning the U.S. into an ethnostate weren't strong enough. Trump's vocal support of white nationalists who marched in Charlottesville upset the former chief economic advisor so much that he resigned the very next eight months later. The original first lady returned to her native Slovenia in May 2018. The former deputy press secretary left the administration for the more traditional reason of joining a lobbying firm. Actually, he's somehow still there. Hey, remember when this guy was one of the most famous people in the world for a little while? Anyway, he resigned, and we're not sure what he's doing now. The one-time communications strategist departed after it became clear his skills at covering up sexual harassment allegations would be put to better use in a role with Trump's reelection campaign. He mostly just delivered mail and coffee, but Ted brightened up any room he was in. Everyone's excited he's going back to school to be a nurse. Good luck, Ted! The resignation of Trump's U.N. ambassador left his administration with one less person bizarrely perceived by the media as a moderate. Can hold her head high after spending two years at Homeland Security protecting Americans from threats both child and infant."

'So far, we have not uncovered any breaking news within the report about recreational boating or boating lifestyles, but we cannot rule out the possibility that the redacted sections contain information on the latest waterskiing trends and other family-friendly activities for speedboaters,' said executive editor Alan Jones, who promised readers Boating World would uphold its usual standards of journalistic excellence in its minute-by-minute analysis of the report's findings in regard to fishing vacations that won't break the bank and the best outboard motors on the market today. 'We do have some promising leads: For example, it is entirely possible that some type of yacht or catamaran was used during Blackwater founder Erik Prince's secret meeting in the Seychelles islands to set up a Trump'Putin back channel. At the very least, we're hoping that at some point before we finish reading this thing, we find evidence of Paul Manafort or Don Jr. or someone putting on a life jacket.' At press time, the Boating World team had published its first update, which began with the words 'Ahoy, there, readers!'"
498,Report: You're Far Too Dumb To Be Reading The Mueller Report Yourself,"WASHINGTON'According to a conclusion reached by expert analysis Thursday, you are far too dumb to be reading Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election yourself. 'To put it bluntly, you are a moron, and as a moron, you lack the basic reading skills that would make looking at this report fruitful in any way,' read the analysis in part, adding that your best option here was to give up on trying to parse over 400 pages of legal text, admit that you are a goddamn idiot, and go back to looking at pictures of dogs or whatever the hell an imbecile like yourself wastes their life doing. 'Wait a few days, let the grown-ups examine this, and then give them a chance to tell you what to think in simple infographic form. Until then, you might as well stop trying to sound out words like 'pursuant,' close your laptop or turn off your phone, and go to sleep for the rest of the day.' The report concluded that despite your personal and intellectual failings, you should still give yourself a nice little pat on the back for trying."
499,Barr Releases Catatonic Mueller After Removing All Sensitive Material From Special Counsel's Brain,"WASHINGTON'In an attempt to satisfy calls for transparency while also keeping delicate information under wraps, Attorney General William Barr announced Thursday that he had released a catatonic Robert Mueller after excising all sensitive material from the special counsel's brain. 'With the cuts we've made to his prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, we can now make Robert Mueller available to both Congress and the American people,' said Barr, who explained that in the four weeks since the special counsel's investigation ended, the Justice Department had gone to great lengths to capture, confine, and forcibly lobotomize Mueller, ensuring any material deemed unsuitable for the public would remain secret. 'In order to keep the details of grand jury testimony and ongoing investigations confidential, we carefully blacked out his memory of the past two years before releasing him. Unfortunately, it would appear this safety precaution has also resulted in Mr. Mueller forgetting how to speak, walk, and feed himself.' At press time, sources confirmed the drooling, glassy-eyed special counsel was set to testify before the House Judiciary Committee, whose members were trying to get him to respond to his name so they could swear him in."

501,Ilhan Omar Disrespectfully Refers To America As 'A Place',"WASHINGTON'In a scathing attack on the very foundations of democracy and everything the United States stands for, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) disrespectfully referred Monday to America, the land of the free and the home of the brave, as 'a place.' 'It's unconscionable to think that this so-called American would use a vile term like 'place' to describe the shining city upon a hill without so much as mentioning its spacious skies or amber waves of grain,' said Maryland resident Greg Blankford, echoing the sentiments of the 327 million patriots condemning the freshman congresswoman's characterization of the nation as 'a location' as anti-Christian, anti-Semitic, and anti-American. 'Maybe to her it's just a country, but to the rest of us, it's a country whose brave soldiers died to protect our freedom. At no point did she even try to correct her mistake by saying the word 'troops' or saluting the nearest flag and crying. What a monster.' At press time, Americans across the country demanded that Omar apologize by dressing from head to toe in patriotic American flag clothing, pulling out a fife, and performing a stirring rendition of 'Yankee Doodle.'"
502,"William Barr Agrees To Release Nonverbal, Abstract Visual Representation Of Mueller Report","WASHINGTON'Explaining that he would present the investigation's findings in a format that offered the most richly detailed portrayal of its full meaning, Attorney General William Barr reportedly agreed Friday to release a nonverbal, abstract visual representation of the Mueller report. 'I'm nearly done going through the special counsel's conclusions and will be ready to deliver them in the form of a multimedia performance featuring interpretative dance, experimental music, and a variety of conceptual art installations within the next week or two,' said Barr, adding that he had already finished summarizing President Trump's firing of James Comey in a 30-minute postmodern movement piece incorporating aerial silks and a fog machine, and had finally hit upon a suitable way to show Congress the significance of Trump's contact with former campaign chair Paul Manafort by smearing red, white, and blue paint on the walls of a white space over a collage of slowed-down audio recorded in a slaughterhouse. 'It's clear, given the nature of the special counsel's findings, that any summary must be issued to Congress with my voice removed, indeed artificially silenced, allowing the canvas of my body to convey the full extent of the report's subconscious dialogues and liminal fixation on agency and the dialectic of guilt and innocence. Indeed, it is only through repeatedly assembling and disassembling a bricolage of objects such as metal pails, rusty saws, and clumps of wax that I can truly express the hidden and fluctuating tensions expressed in Mueller's analysis of whether Trump pressured Jeff Sessions to conform to his wishes. The American people deserve to see a full performance of me lying nude and motionless on a concrete slab under a Cubist portrait of Mueller as masked, mute figures representing Donald Jr., Michael Flynn, and Michael Cohen slowly walk in circles, tearing pieces of paper and scattering them over me, every so often extemporaneously interrupting the sounds of kettle drum and lagerphone by erupting in a primal scream. Only then can Americans fully understand the truth.' Barr also clarified that in order to protect classified government intelligence, he would have to perform the part of his presentation where he wordlessly beats his chest, smears himself in glitter, and repeatedly turns on and off several televisions behind a curtain where no one can see."
503,"Lightning Bolt Blasts Washington Monument As Mike Pence, Pete Buttigieg Locked In Battle Of Prayers On National Mall","WASHINGTON'Peering into the darkened sky as 200-mph winds began to whip around them, several eyewitnesses confirmed Thursday that a lightning bolt blasted off the top of the Washington Monument while Mike Pence and Pete Buttigieg were locked in a battle of prayers on the National Mall. According to onlookers, the current vice president and mayor of South Bend, IN could be seen kneeling on the ground with their hands folded, deep in prayer, at which point Mike Pence whispered that 'Mr. Buttigieg knows better than to question my faith,' causing the sky to turn black, the water in the Reflecting Pool to part, and the two men to slowly levitate several feet above the ground. As the temperature dropped and the earth burst open below them, witnesses confirmed that Buttigieg's eyes turned red, and the presidential candidate shouted, 'If you have a problem with me, you have a problem with my maker,' immediately flinging Mr. Pence backwards into the Vietnam War Memorial with an eruption of psychic energy. At press time, Pence and Buttigieg reportedly fused into a single, blindingly white light as countless angels swirled around them from the heavens, only to plummet back to the ground below and lay unconscious while the sky opened up, birds began to chirp, and daylight returned to normal."
504,Majority Of Americans Voice Support For Bernie Sanders After Learning He's A Millionaire,"WASHINGTON'Saying they are now convinced the candidate is overwhelmingly qualified to lead the country, a majority of Americans have shifted their support to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in the 2020 presidential race since learning he is a millionaire, a Pew Research Center poll found Wednesday. 'I have my reservations about his policies, but if the guy's a millionaire, he must know what he's doing,' said Cleveland-area voter Glenn Mannix, 48, echoing the sentiments of 68% of the voting populace, who were reportedly impressed upon discovering the royalties Sanders has earned on sales of his books has pushed his net worth to seven figures. 'Anyone who's smart enough to make a million dollars has got to have some pretty great ideas about how to move our country in the right direction. You don't get to be that rich and successful without having a really good head on your shoulders. The man has my vote!' According to the poll, the remaining 32% of voters agree with all of Sanders' policies, but said they cannot bring themselves to cast their ballot for someone who owns three homes."
505,Family Of Congressman Glad He Finally Found Outlet For His Racism,"WASHINGTON'Expressing relief that the Republican can finally channel his long-held bigotry into wide-reaching legislative action, family of Texas congressman Louie Gohmert told reporters Wednesday they were glad he finally found an outlet for his racism. 'It's always hard to see someone you love wander aimlessly, which is why we were all so relieved when our Lou found a nice little community of white men his age in the U.S. House of Representatives who believe in their genetic superiority just like him,' said wife Kathy Gohmert, adding that she's proud her three children could see their father deal with all his prejudices in a healthy way by putting those beliefs into fear-mongering and policymaking. 'All his potential was going to waste, so it was a real joy for us when it finally contributed to something real, like using yesterday's hearings to discredit the legitimate, well-documented threat of white nationalism. It was a long journey to get here, but ever since the Birther movement, his conspiracy theories about Middle East terror babies, and the paranoia he spread about the Muslim Brotherhood, he's just been so, so much happier.' Family members added that they haven't seen Gohmert this happy since he was threatening the well-being of minorities as a state district judge."

'Though I admired Kirstjen's ability to remain cold and detached when questioned about the decision to tear apart families at the border, we require someone with an even greater lack of empathy to do this job properly,' said the president, who praised Nielsen for putting children in cages but explained that the ideal candidate for the position must possess a degree of psychopathy so severe that they believe no law or moral code of any kind applies to them. 'The next person to head the department must be blessed with strong narcissistic tendencies, of course, but also a consistent record of profoundly antisocial behavior. We need someone both spiteful and cruel, but also willing to totally disregard right and wrong. Basically, the new secretary will need to have a psychological makeup that allows them to look people in the eye and tell them, without hesitation, that we don't want any non-Americans entering the United States unless they're coming from one of a very limited group of countries in northern Europe.' At press time, a team of psychiatrists had reportedly presented the president with a stack of rsums that consisted solely of individuals housed in supermax prisons and White House senior adviser Stephen Miller."

'This report has found the president so overwhelmingly innocent that the average human mind, unable to grasp just how completely free from culpability he is, would lose its grip on reality and spiral into insanity,' said Huckabee-Sanders, who warned that the general public, upon reading the 300-page report, would be reduced to 'gibbering idiots,' foaming at the mouth as they read the secret revelations that confirm President Trump is the single least-guilty individual in the history of mankind. 'If everyday citizens were to see for themselves how thoroughly the president has been absolved from any conceivable wrongdoing, they would have a total psychotic breakdown, perhaps gouging their eyes out or stripping naked and running into oncoming traffic. Maybe Democrats don't care if crazed readers of the full report start cannibalizing their own family members, but in the interests of public safety, we cannot release these pages.' Huckabee-Sanders later added that a raving, feral Attorney General William Barr had recently been fitted with a straightjacket and confined to a secure psychiatric facility."

'I heard someone down the hall talking about badges of some kind'am I supposed to have one too?' the nation's top diplomat said while straining to peek over White House innovation director Jared Kushner's shoulder to read the confidential documents in his hand. 'Does everyone have one of those lanyards except me? You guys would tell me if I should have gotten one, right? Maybe mine is still on its way. In the meantime, could you maybe just fill me in on any important stuff that happens? That'd be awesome.' At press time, sources confirmed Pompeo was standing outside the Situation Room and had decided it was probably best to just press his ear up to the door until someone realized he was missing from the meeting and came to let him in."

'Maybe some of my opponents are comfortable courting big donors who will give them 15, even 20 bucks, but as long as I'm in this race, anyone who hands me a dollar bill will immediately be handed 73 cents in change,' said the Vermont senator, who during a rally at a municipal auditorium expressed complete confidence that he could fund his organization all the way through the 2020 general election with nothing but the loose change in his supporters' pockets. 'Right now, if you have a quarter and a nickel in the ashtray of your car out in the parking lot, give that to me, and I'll give you three pennies back. That's all I need to put the people back in charge of this country. But if you have any big glass jars full of change, save those for the Coinstar machine, because the presidency of the United States should never be for sale.' An hour after finishing his speech, Sanders was spotted hanging around in the lobby and helping people break tens and twenties so they could use a nearby soda machine. "
513,Mueller Kinda Miffed That Barr Clearly Didn't Read His Stuff Like He Said He Would,"WASHINGTON'Irked that the attorney general's brief summary of his meticulously written report reflected only a surface-level understanding of its contents, Special Counsel Robert Mueller told reporters Monday he was peeved that William Barr clearly didn't read his stuff like he suggested he would. 'I worked really hard on this thing for two years, put some great stuff in there, and as far as I can tell he just glanced over it briefly and tossed it aside,' said Mueller, who expressed irritation that Barr, despite assuring the former FBI director that he couldn't wait to read his new work, had apparently not bothered to absorb the nuanced, comprehensive 300-page report before writing a cursory, four-page letter about it. 'I mean, there was some pretty hard-hitting material in there'did he miss that completely? Either he skimmed through it really fast or he handed it off to an assistant without reading it all. Seriously, I put my heart and soul into those pages, and the best he can muster in a superficial response that almost entirely misses the point? What the hell?' At press time, Mueller was reportedly worried that maybe Barr flat-out hated his work and had offered the vague, bare-bones summary in order to spare the special counsel's feelings."
514,Trump Boys Defend Sending Saudi Arabia Plans For Cool Missile On Personal Etch A Sketch,"WASHINGTON'Insisting that they had taken every measure to keep the message 'extra top secret,' the Trump boys reportedly spent Wednesday defending their decision to send Saudi Arabia plans for a cool missile using their personal Etch A Sketch. 'We spent, like, a million hours making that rocket look super good, so we had to send it to our friends in Sunny Arabia [sic] as soon as we could,' said Eric Trump of the jagged rendering of an airborne missile with what appeared to be a lightning bolt on its side, noting that they had done everything they could to ensure the privacy of the plans, which included labeled stick-figures of both brothers as well as a dog that they hoped their dad would buy for them. 'No one even gave us a government Etch A Sketch. Besides, there's this awesome ninja in there that would have been way too hard to redo. Plus, we made sure the prince knew to shake it up when he was done, just so it's all super safe.' At press time, the Trump boys were denying responsibility for the recent leak of Lite-Brite plans for a new baby brother."

'What the hell? I worked so hard on this'if I wasn't colluding with the Trump campaign, who the hell was I colluding with?' said the dumbfounded Russian president, growing increasingly angry as he scrolled through his email inbox and recounted his numerous efforts at covert communication with individuals who he had thought were high-ranking Trump officials, but now he suspected were bots or anonymous internet trolls. 'Man, it seemed so legit. I can't believe I let myself get conned like this. I spent so much time emailing back and forth with DonaldTrump46@hotmail.com about compromising the democratic voting process, and now it turns out it was all fake? And we spent so much time gathering all that kompromat on the wrong people. Goddammit, I feel like I've wasted my life.'

516,Compassionate Trump Issues Full Presidential Pardon For Robert Mueller,"WASHINGTON'Exercising his powers of clemency for the first time since taking office, President Trump compassionately issued a full presidential pardon Monday for former Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller that cleared him of any wrongdoing. 'Today, under my authority as president of the United States, I hereby grant a full and unconditional pardon to Robert Mueller, a man who has spent the past two years being slandered for misdeeds that he never even committed,' said Trump, stressing that though Mueller had his share of missteps, recently released evidence now proved that the special counsel's heart has always been in the right place. 'This poor guy has been through Hell and back. He's had dirt thrown on his name and been unfairly attacked on social media, and for what? He's a good, honorable man. So today I'm saying: Bob, go home to your family. You've earned it.'

Barr declared Monday that Robert Mueller's investigation fully exonerates all members of Ronald Reagan's presidential administration from involvement in the Iran'Contra affair. 'I've reviewed Mr. Mueller's findings and have determined conclusively that neither the late president nor any White House or Cabinet official serving between 1981 and 1989 ever ordered, oversaw, or even knew about the covert sales of American arms to Iran,' Barr said in a letter to the House and Senate judiciary committees, clearing key figures such as retired National Security Adviser John Poindexter and former staffer Oliver North in a move that finally lifts what many have seen as a dark cloud over the scandal-plagued presidency. 'I assessed this report carefully and can at long last say with full certainty that Caspar Weinberger, Robert McFarlane, Elliott Abrams, and all others in the president's inner circle operated lawfully from the time of the initial dealings in 1981 until the illegal arrangement was exposed five years later. From the 1985 diversion of funds to Contra rebels in Nicaragua, to Reagan's untruthful 1986 denial of an arms-for-hostage trade, to the flagrant destruction of countless documents relevant to the investigation, everyone acted properly and with the best interests of the United States in mind. It is my hope that the country can now move forward and put this unfortunate episode behind it.' At press time, sources reported that Democratic leaders in Congress were still discussing a possible push for President Reagan's impeachment."
518,Trump Ramps Up Attacks On John McCain By Dragging Senator's Exhumed Corpse Behind Motorcade,"WASHINGTON'Doubling down on his criticism of the departed lawmaker in the face of bipartisan condemnation, President Trump ramped up his attacks Thursday against the late John McCain by exhuming the senator's corpse and dragging it behind his presidential motorcade. 'I'm having some trouble understanding the strategy behind unearthing the body of this true American hero, chaining it to the bumper of a limousine, and driving it around our nation's capital,' said Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT), who added that shackling McCain's half-decomposed remains by the neck to the presidential state car and speeding through D.C.'s most pothole-ridden streets would only serve to distract people from Trump's important policy initiatives. 'It's not only counterproductive, but an insult to John McCain's memory to see his lifeless body bouncing and flailing across the National Mall like that. It certainly wasn't necessary for them to exceed 55 miles on the Beltway. I'd really prefer if the president refrained from such conduct.' At press time, sources confirmed Trump had further escalated his attacks against the late senator by off-roading with the corpse through the rugged terrain of Rock Creek Park."
519,Devin Nunes Threatens Defamation Lawsuit After Reputation Ruined By His Official Twitter Account,"WASHINGTON'Vowing to fight tooth and nail against what he called 'an insidious smear campaign,' Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) announced Wednesday he was considering filing a defamation lawsuit against his official Twitter account for ruining his reputation. 'The figure behind @DevinNunes has disparaged my good name in what appears to be a highly coordinated effort to make me look like some kind of whiny, impetuous idiot,' said the House Intelligence Committee's ranking member, who accused the verified account of repeatedly posting and sharing content that has portrayed him as 'a crackpot with abhorrent views' since the profile was first created in 2009. 'The fact that Twitter has allowed this account to exist for nearly a decade is a major testament to the platform's left-leaning bias. They've stood idly by and watched while my official account has spewed out nothing but drivel and lies. This is character assassination, pure and simple.' Nunes added that hopefully the lawsuit would serve as a stern warning to other outlets that have smeared him, including his official Facebook account, his official campaign website, and Nunes.house.gov."
520,Biden Pulls Off Dusty Tarp Covering Old Campaign Motorcycle,"WASHINGTON'Saying it was time to 'get out the hog for one last ride,' former Vice President Joe Biden pulled the dusty painter's tarp off of his old campaign motorcycle Wednesday, gently running his hand along the polished chrome headlight and muttering 'welcome back, baby.' The vehicle, a 1979 Harley-Davidson Electra Glide with flame decals on both the front and rear fenders, had reportedly been sitting at the back of his garage since the last time he 'tore ass' around the capitol in 2012. Sources confirmed that after checking to see if the horn still worked, Biden grabbed a red chamois cloth from his back pocket, spit into it, and begin buffing the bike's custom 'Diamond Joe' gas tank. 'The Cherry Chariot rides again,' said Biden, patting the sheepskin seat and releasing a small cloud of dust that was visible in the shop light above his 1980 Christy Brinkley Sports Illustrated poster. 'Still a looker that can turn every damn head on the block.' 'What do you say we get you out of this cooped-up pen and go for a little spin?' Biden added while inspecting the muffler, a part he briefly removed during his 2007 primary bid to 'let her rip loud as hell' at the Iowa State Fair. 'You and I have a lot of catching up to do.' Biden, who claimed that the bike could use a new paint job, said that with Bernie Sanders pulling his same old 'commie shit' and Elizabeth Warren 'totally tanking' in the polls, there was an opening for a Democrat who could ride in on 900 pounds of all-American steel and speak to the middle class. Biden pointed out the motorcycle's well-worn tire treads and explained that the touring bike, which he won in a 1981 drag race against Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill had 'done Diamond Joe real solid' in his 1988 and 2008 presidential runs. The 76-year-old confirmed that just the sound of the engine tearing down an open straightaway was always enough to draw crowds that wanted to 'get an eyeful of the goods.' Biden also noted that the vehicle's sidecar was the perfect size to hold either a running mate or keg. 'I used to take this thing up and down the coast. I even got Pelosi to come with for a little weekend shot up to the Delaware Water Gap,' said the former vice president, who added that some of his best early Senate memories were from that trip, with then-Junior-Representative Pelosi passing him ice-cold tallboys from the passenger saddle. 'The bike has a personality all its own. Ask anyone who's come to any of my town halls over the years. The thing's a 450-cc white-hot clam magnet.' 'You hear that baby purring into third gear, your vote isn't the only thing Uncle Joe's gonna get,' continued Biden. According to the former six-term Delaware senator, the motorcycle has been involved in a 'ton of dicey scrapes.' Biden confirmed that during his previous presidential runs, the bike's cam chain snapped 'all the fucking time,' including once on the way to a diner in New Hampshire in 1988, forcing him to hitch a ride with a passing truck driver with whom he traveled the state until his campaign manager Gooch could tow it to a shop. 'I remember once I totally ate it around Buffalo in spring '87. Let me tell ya, black ice will fuck you up. That's how I got this,' said Biden, pulling down his oil-stained jeans to reveal a 4-inch scar above his left hip. 'I probably should have gone to the ER, but instead I just dumped a bottle of Jack onto the wound, wrapped it in an old Baja hoodie, hammered the fork back into place, and hauled ass to the next campaign stop.' 'Let's face it, I'm not as young as I used to be,' Biden continued. 'It pains me to say, but I'm probably going to pussy out and wear a brain bucket for this rodeo.' At press time, Biden reportedly opened the motorcycle's studded leather storage bag to show off his official campaign steamroller."

'White Castle was the lifeblood of this community, but unfortunately, during a previous presidential administration, it was closed down,' said Trump, describing the hardships faced by local families, many of whom patronized the White Castle for generations but can no longer purchase a 30-slider Crave Case without driving more than two hours round-trip to reach the chain's Ann Arbor, MI location. 'This town was built on jalapeo sliders, onion rings, and mozzarella cheese sticks, but now it's getting screwed over by foreign companies like Taco Bell and Panda Express. Frankly, it's a disgrace, and I'm in talks with the regional franchise manager to reopen this restaurant and make sure Ohioans have access to all the best American fast foods. Nobody should be forced to sell their home and uproot their family just to move to a town with a White Castle.' When asked about the danger to fast food jobs posed by automated burger-flipping machines, the president responded that he hasn't looked into it yet but knows a lot about technology and believes the threat is nonexistent."

'I've always loved Barack's early stuff from back in '08, even '04, and I think diehard fans will go crazy when I cover all his greatest hits,' said the 46-year-old White House hopeful, clarifying that he and his campaign aides had spent several months 'just going through Barack's catalog' to memorize the former president's platform. 'Obama's style always really resonated with me, and honestly, what's the point in struggling to come up with something new when you can just give people what they want. I'm going to cover some of Barack's most well-known campaign speeches, putting my own small twists on prison reform and healthcare'they'll be way heavier, faster, and louder.' At press time, O'Rourke revealed that he had just finished working on a stripped-down version of 'Change We Can Believe In' that went directly into a fiery rendition of 'Yes, We Can!'"

'At a time when Americans are more divided than ever, what this country needs is a riverwalk that will provide people from all strata of society with continuous strolling, dining, and festival opportunities,' said Buttigieg, gesturing to a watercolor architectural rendering of the Intercontinental Riverwalk that he described as his 'core campaign plank,' which would revitalize the country's heartlands by attracting sorely needed coffee shops, clothing boutiques, and artisanal cocktail bars in riverside locations stretching from coast to coast. 'Whether you're just popping down to check out one of our Nationwide Art Fridays or enjoying a relaxing date night of jazz quartets in Tucson and hyper-local food in Louisville, a riverwalk gives our citizens the chance to appreciate this great nation's beauty through the unparalleled convenience of bike and pedestrian trails stretching from sea to shining sea. That's why, if elected, this will be my first act in office.'

'For years, students of flag-making such as myself have sketched prototypes for a hypothetical 51-star grid, so right now we're all on pins and needles thinking we might finally get to see an updated American flag,' said Iowa-based flag dweeb Theodore Dreyfus, adding that the renewed push for D.C. statehood had generated highly contentious debates among the dorks in online vexillology forums over just where on the American flag the prospective 51st star should be placed. 'We're also getting pretty worked up over what a flag for the state of Washington, D.C. might look like. Sure, they could just use the district flag they already have, but there are many other exciting options available to them. They could make a flag that includes their new state seal, a picture of George Washington, or maybe even the year they got their statehood. The mind boggles at the possibilities!' At press time, flag nerds across the country were reportedly engaged in heated exchanges about hoists, cantons, fimbriation, fesses, and five-pointed spur-rowels."

'As many as 47 percent of those surveyed indicated that they'd vote for somebody called Bobby Cheeseburger in a heartbeat without even needing to know all his policy positions,' said pollster Emily Jones, telling reporters that almost a third of Iowans believed a guy named Bobby Cheeseburger could use his homespun wisdom and commitment to American values to bring real change to Washington. 'Over half of respondents said they believe that a Bobby Cheeseburger candidacy would stand a strong chance of defeating Trump in the general election by bridging the gap between centrists and liberals as well as appealing to Republicans, and 40 percent said that, if elected, they believed Bobby Cheeseburger would restore our standing in the international community. This level of excitement so early in the primary is really startling, especially when you consider that voters' second choice, a candidate named Bonnie Cheeseburger, is only polling at 15 percent.' Jones noted that the poll found there was less than 1 percent support for a candidate named Tommy Broccoli or former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper."

'The only Americans who know how to operate these complex doors are MIT engineers and rocket scientists, and regular people can't go inside or outside anymore. There's a million things to twist and turn and all these buttons, you push and push on them as hard as you can, and yet still half the time doors don't even work.' Trump added that the issue of door technology struck a personal chord for him, as many of the people who open doors for him are not very smart and often have trouble doing so."

'It's completely outrageous that my fellow members of Congress would slander me with charges of bigotry when I have shared a water fountain with African-Americans for over a decade without ever even batting an eye,' said the Freedom Caucus chair, citing his long history of racial tolerance that included letting black members of Congress use the same entrance into the Capitol building and waiting patiently in line behind them in the cafeteria without demanding to be served first. 'Shame on Democrats for launching these false and nakedly political attacks against me when they know full well that I have never called the police on my black colleagues for talking to a white woman, or tried to deprive them of voting in committee.

'I am not sure how you expect us to just sit here and trust that you're actually going to tell the truth about your involvement with the president when you've said absolutely nothing about these scandalous abuse allegations'what are you hiding?' said Jordan, interrupting another congressperson's questioning to call attention to the fact that paperwork Cohen submitted ahead of the hearing contained nothing about knowing that hundreds of OSU wrestlers were abused by a team doctor, including during the period from 1986 to 1994 when Jordan served as an assistant coach. 'Who are you to accuse the president of crimes given your shady past and connections to Ohio State? You're obviously only doing this to distance yourself from this disgraceful cover-up, and the fact that you won't admit to your role in it completely invalidates any shred of decency you might have.

'Throwing away millions of taxpayer dollars on vanity projects is Congress's job, not the president's,' said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi following the 245-to-182 vote to overturn Trump's declaration, explaining that Article I of the Constitution clearly invests the legislative branch with the sole authority to mismanage public money. 'Abusing the power of the purse is expressly reserved to the House and Senate. So it's not up to the president to decide when we funnel money from one place to another, diverting it from its intended purpose. Burning through cash'whether we're inflating the military budget or showering millions in unnecessary spending on our home districts'is an exclusively congressional task.' Pelosi concluded her remarks by praising the Founding Fathers for making the House, which is more directly representative of the people, the place where all bills for flushing money directly down the drain must originate."

'There was one agent who claimed he really liked my stuff, but didn't think he could get any of the publishing houses to bite,' said Mueller, who described his report as a classic tale of deception, greed, and international intrigue exposing the rotten core beneath the superficial veneer of American politics. 'I really put my heart and soul into this, so it hurts getting a form rejection letter from someone who obviously didn't even read it. I used to pin them to the wall for motivation, but now I'm running out of room and that's just super depressing. I still think the report is really compelling and has a lot of fun twists and turns. I even got a subscription to Publishers Weekly, but now I'm out 500 bucks and have nothing to show for it. I'm sure as hell not going to self-publish an e-book on Amazon. I guess maybe it's time to just admit defeat.' At press time, Mueller reportedly elected to destroy his original manuscript rather than take an agent's suggestion to edit the draft down to a 250-page YA investigation."

'Today we recognize those who, like myself, would have been forced to make the ultimate sacrifice had they not come from wealthy families who could call in a favor from a doctor friend and get exempted from the draft,' said Trump, speaking for several minutes about the death he would have faced if he had been unable to afford an elite education and, instead of receiving college deferments, had been conscripted to fight in a conflict in which more than 58,000 Americans died. 'I would have died bravely with my fellow soldiers right here in this field had I not had a father who could pull some strings and make sure I never had to do anything like that. So today, I reflect upon and honor all those who were able to avoid service, especially those who received a medical deferment from a podiatrist who rented office space from their dad.' Trump went on to announce that a new monument would be erected on the National Mall in Washington to honor all affluent survivors of the Vietnam draft."
547,White House Convenes Panel Of Scientists To Make Case That Trump Capable Of Crushing Train With Bare Hands,"WASHINGTON'Demonstrating their findings with a crumpled ball of aluminum foil, a panel of White House'appointed scientists convened for the first time Tuesday to argue that President Donald Trump possesses the strength to crush an entire train with his bare hands. 'Based on this group's assessment, the president could easily compress a 400,000-pound diesel locomotive and any cars it was pulling into a twisted mass of debris no larger than your kitchen table,' said Liberty University civil engineering professor Jonah Crockett, who heads the new presidential committee, adding that his calculations suggest Trump could then toss the entire train over his shoulder or, if he wanted to, swallow it whole. 'We realize many people out there do not believe Mr. Trump could physically overpower a 3-mile-long freight train barreling down the tracks, so we want to set the record straight: He absolutely could. You may find scientists who tell you the 45th president could not grab a length of hot-rolled steel, bite a chunk out of it, and spit bullets, but they are all bought-and-paid-for members of a widespread, global cult of railroad zealots.' At press time, Crockett confirmed his team would next be investigating whether President Trump was perhaps capable of building a train so strong that even he could not crush it."

'Across Venezuela, people are being kidnapped, tortured, and isolated from their families, and it is completely unacceptable for any nation to treat straight citizens like this,' said Pence, promising that the United States would continue to fight for democracy and the fundamental human rights of every non-gay Venezuelan. 'Nobody who is attracted to the opposite sex should ever have to endure the pain and oppression the Venezuelan people have suffered. To see gangs of violent thugs attacking a straight person in the streets is an outrage. We want the world to know we stand with the hetero people of Venezuela.' Pence concluded his statement by declaring that all Christian people deserve a sovereign nation free from violence."
549,Netanyahu Defends New Alliance With Israel's Far-Right Aryan Supremacy Party,"JERUSALEM'Insisting that criticism of the political partnership did not take into account the need for a coalition large enough to enact his agenda, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended Monday his new alliance with the country's far-right Aryan Supremacy Party. 'My detractors must look at the bigger picture here and understand that although everyone may not agree with their belief in the genetic superiority of the Aryan bloodline, they are ready and willing to work with me,' said Netanyahu, adding that he had made a pact to offer multiple cabinet positions to the far-right anti-Semitic extremist group in exchange for their support in the upcoming April election. 'They may hold a fervent belief in white supremacy and militant observance of Christian Identity, but the Aryan Supremacy Party is more than just virulent advocates of racial violence; they're also prepared to toil on my reelection campaign, and for that I think it's fair to reward them. People need to focus less on their broad anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial and look at the positive ideas these skinheads can bring to my future coalition government. For example, our ideological attitude toward Arabs aligns almost perfectly.' When reached for comment, U.S. secretary of state Mike Pompeo was quick to say that the Trump administration would not take any position on the alliance during an Israeli election year. "

'If you're going to be in my Cabinet, I gotta make sure I have your complete allegiance,' said the president before spinning the cylinder and handing the loaded weapon to the whimpering Justice Department head. 'I've been burned before, Bill, and this time I'm not taking any chances. Interviews, vetting, the Senate confirmation'all meaningless. This is the only test that matters.' At press time, Trump was reportedly leading deputy attorney general nominee Jeffrey Rosen into a darkened room and ordering him to murder a bound-and-gagged White House aide, who was believed to have betrayed the president."
552,Mueller Admits A Smarter President Would've Totally Found Way To Stop Investigation By Now,"WASHINGTON'In response to President Donald Trump's continued attacks against the legitimacy of his probe into 2016 election interference, Special Counsel Robert Mueller admitted Thursday that a smarter president would have totally found a way to stop the investigation by now. 'Listen, my investigation has been going on for two years, and any president with even a modicum of intelligence would have absolutely figured out a way to end this thing a long time ago,' said Mueller, shaking his head in disbelief as he listed a number of loopholes, executive maneuvers, and other strategies that any moderately smart commander in chief could use to invalidate the probe and prevent Mueller from bringing charges against anyone, much less multiple members of Trump's inner circle. 'When we started this thing I figured we'd have a month or two, tops, before he'd discover any of the pretty obvious ways that he could nip this thing in the bud. Hell, if Trump just had any negotiation ability or public relations skills whatsoever, he could've just used good old-fashioned deal-making to shut this thing down. I mean, if he knew what he was doing, even slightly, he'd be the most powerful man in the world. I'm actually impressed with how his every move just screws things up more. Christ, how much of a colossal fucking idiot do you have to be to let this go on and on?' Mueller also admitted that a smarter president would've found a way to actually cover his election interference up in the first place."

'We're not going to make those mistakes again'not in 2020, not ever,' said Cleveland resident Jerry Van Buskirk, one of 328 million U.S. residents who still spends hours each day scrolling through various social media platforms and consuming either news tailored by algorithms to magnify his pre-existing biases or outright disinformation aimed at duping him. 'We refuse to allow a clickbait-driven journalism industry that privileges scandal and controversy over facts and nuance to shape our discourse. Our democracy is too important.' At press time, sources confirmed the nation had taken to social media to spread its message."
554,Trump Agrees To Wear Wire To Take Down Roger Stone,"WASHINGTON'Vowing to do whatever he could to help Special Counsel Robert Mueller investigate the campaign consultant's role in 2016 election interference, President Trump reportedly agreed Wednesday to wear a wire to take down Roger Stone. 'I've known Roger for years, but it's time to put my country first and do anything I can to take this guy down,' said Trump as Mueller's aides taped a wire to his chest, after which he agreed to let the special counsel bug his phone to listen in on future conversations that could provide evidence conclusively tying Stone to contacts from WikiLeaks and Russia who were trying to subvert the election. 'I know I can get Roger to talk'give me an hour alone in a room with him and I'll have all the damning evidence on tape, and then we can finally get this menace behind bars. I'm an American first and foremost, and if I can help undo any of the damage he's done to this country, I'll do it, even if it means recording Stone without his knowledge and lying to his face.' In addition to his desire to serve his country, Trump was also reportedly convinced to wear a wire by Mueller's promise that any charges against him would be dropped. "
555,Trump Confirms All Violent Options On The Table In Venezuela,"WASHINGTON'In an effort to remain as objective as possible when considering ways of addressing the ongoing crisis, President Trump told reporters Tuesday that he was leaving all violent options on the table in Venezuela. 'If America's interests are threatened anywhere in the world, the U.S. retains the right to use every brutal means it has at its disposal, whether that's using drone strikes or chemical weapons, or just carpet bombing hospitals,' said the president, adding that he would not rule out addressing Venezuela's instability with ground forces, unilateral bombings, or propping up a death squad in the rainforest that kidnaps and tortures civilians. 'Obviously, we're looking very seriously at the more traditional response of a bloody coup. But my advisors are also thinking up some creative solutions like detonating a nuke in the center of Caracas. It's all worth discussing to find the best way to maximize casualties.' At press time, the White House released a follow-up statement announcing that all nonviolent options had been tabled except for starving the Venezuelan people through a few more sanctions."
556,"Trump Offers Clear, Historical Precedent For Deploying U.S. Military With No Provocation","WASHINGTON'Providing a lengthy, comprehensive explanation of the factors influencing his decision to declare a national emergency that would send military funding and personnel to the nation's southern border, President Donald Trump offered a clear, historical precedent Friday for deploying the U.S. military with no provocation. 'What the critics who have questioned the validity of my actions seem to be ignoring is that there are abundant examples of instances in the history of this country wherein a president invoked his executive powers to station troops, not to defend ourselves against an aggressor, but simply to further our nation's economic and political interests,' said Trump at press conference, frequently referencing a chart he had created tracking U.S. military deployments through history both within the country and abroad, specifically citing President Andrew Jackson overriding the Indian Removal Act and the Supreme Court ruling in Worcester v. Georgia in the forced expulsion by the military of the Cherokee from their lands, the secret use of military advisors and support by Dwight D. Eisenhower in the 1953 Iranian coup d'tat, and the recent precedent of extraneous invasions of other countries without the approval of Congress in violation of the War Powers Resolution by Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. 'Listen, folks, I would invite you to consult the history books, where you will see that posting troops at the border in the defense of an exaggerated claim that such security is needed to protect Americans is broadly in line with similar invasions, troop deployments, and other military activities throughout American history perpetuated to annex land, attack countries with governments not subservient to our country, or to further the interests of our client states. What I'm doing is entirely in keeping with the way that the U.S. government usually acts'time and time again, our leaders have ignored the basic conditions that would prompt acceptable military action, so why should this national emergency be treated differently? To this end, I would quote the words of Noam Chomsky, who said that 'If the Nuremberg laws were applied, then every post-war American president would have been hanged.' I would additionally invite my critics to consult scholarly texts on William McKinley's role in the annexation of the Philippines, the rationale used by Lyndon Johnson for ramping up troops in Vietnam, and Richard Nixon's economic warfare in the 1973 Chilean coup, as I have, if they are interested in understanding why any accusation that I, as president, do not have historical precedent to back me up on this border security effort is without merit.' Trump also added that such precedents, as well as U.S. military activity in Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Cuba, would give him more than sufficient historical justification for any similarly unprovoked, unilateral military action his administration may decide to undertake in Venezuela."
557,Trump Base Celebrates President For Standing Up To Constitution,"WASHINGTON'Enthusiastically praising the commander-in-chief for holding firm in the face of opposition, Donald Trump's political base cheered on the president Friday for standing up to the U.S. Constitution. 'He stayed strong and really showed the Constitution who's boss,' said 48-year-old Trump supporter Ross Heddens, applauding the president's bravery and determination in taking on the document that represents the social contract through which all authority vested in the U.S. government is ultimately derived. 'No fundamental system of laws is going to get in his way. Trump has shown that he won't allow mere constitutional articles'not even the ones that explicitly delineate which powers are granted to which branches of government'to stop him from doing what he has pledged to do. That's how tough he is.' Members of Trump's base went on to urge the president to continue standing his ground by ignoring any future rulings from the U.S. Supreme Court that may seek to prevent him from fulfilling his campaign promises."

'You've got to understand that running roughshod over universally accepted notions of basic human rights was simply how things were done in those days,' said Abrams, who explained that during his years in the Reagan administration, supporting the massacre of an entire village of helpless civilians and then heading out to a bar to celebrate with your buddies was just what you did. 'All of us were into that stuff. You'd find a military force friendly to American business interests, get them to slaughter anyone who wasn't, and then dismiss the victims as communist guerillas. People were doing it all the time. It certainly didn't stop anyone from letting me be assistant secretary of state for human rights and humanitarian affairs. Hell, I knew people who would make fun of you if you hadn't committed a war crime or two.' Abrams went on to wax nostalgic about all the crazy late nights he spent with Lt. Col. Oliver North funneling money to right-wing terrorist groups in Nicaragua."
561,"Trump Invites Supporter, BBC Cameraman To Finish Altercation At White House","WASHINGTON'Hoping to create a teachable moment after one of his supporters attacked a BBC cameraman at a rally in El Paso, TX, President Trump announced Tuesday he had invited the two men to join him at the White House so they could finish their altercation. 'It's time for these guys to acknowledge their differences and settle this disagreement with an honest exchange of blows'a no-holds-barred fight right here in the East Room,' Trump told reporters as workers behind him rolled away a grand piano, removed a Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington, and laid down a large tarp to protect the carpet from blood and sweat stains. 'Last night in El Paso, tempers flared and a physical confrontation occurred. I believe it will be very productive for the two sides to come together, grab a couple bottles of beer, break them over their knees, and then just tear into each other, you know? Let's let them finish this thing once and for all.' Sources confirmed Trump later phoned the assaulted cameraman, Ron Skeans, and reminded him to bring his video equipment, explaining that Americans were 'definitely going to want to see footage of this.'"

'He's an elected official? In the United States Senate?' said Cleveland resident Sonja Burke, echoing the sentiments of the entire American populace after she was told Booker'who once fabricated a story about meeting a drug dealer named T-Bone'was viewed as a prominent Democrat. 'Huh. I've been laughing at all the dumb stuff he says, but now that I know he's been a senator for years, it's not so funny. And apparently he was mayor of Newark? That's a pretty good-sized city.

'It is our dream to be part of your planet's nation's Congress, and that is why we are putting upon a challenge to the other human lifeform who is running for the role. It is time for progress that will ensure the Earth will survive for future generations of those who are coming, who, yes, are already on their way. It is time for fresh blood'blood, blood, bloodE' Sources also reported that Kelly's twin brother, Scott, had admitted that he had never noticed any political aspirations from his brother but that now it is all he ever talks about."

'Christ, he just emailed me a Washington Post link with the subject line 'BOMBSHELL''I know the kid just wants to help, but this article is about work I completed months ago,' said the visibly exasperated special counsel, adding that Schiff woke him up with a 2:00 a.m. phone call to excitedly inform him about a CNN report on new indictments that Mueller had filed. 'No shit, Sherlock'what the hell does he think I've been doing for the past two years? I'm starting to think he believes I wasn't already aware of the Trump Tower meeting. If he comes up to me and asks 'Is this a clue?' one more time, I'm going to fucking lose it.' At press time, Schiff had reportedly stumbled upon irrefutable proof of a conspiracy between President Trump and Russia, but kept it to himself because he didn't want to get on Mueller's nerves again."

'It was all in good fun'and honestly, how many people would have recognized me as Michael Jackson if I wasn't committing acts of pedophilia? Virtually no one. Would I do it now? Of course not. I'd probably just go out and buy a chimp. Listen, I loved Michael Jackson, and I never meant to offend. It was supposed to be a tribute.' At press time, Northam claimed that he would have come clean about the pedophilia sooner had he not been so strung out on powerful sedatives."

'At first I thought maybe they'd be different enough, but as soon as he started talking about the migrant caravan, I knew I was toast. Shit, everyone will think I just copied him. I spent so much time on this, and now I have to rush to rearrange the whole thing. 'America First' was supposed to be my shining moment. At least I can keep the part about loving my son Eric.'

'Oh man, the part with the rainforest noises, warm mist, and tropical music totally put me in Venezuela!

At this rate, he should be ready to reveal his findings about the first 96 hours of the Trump campaign by 2020.'

Then, oh Roger, then shall everyone know the full extent of my power and feel the rasping caress of my dominion. You have served well as my mortal, fleshly vessel. You shall be rewarded thrice over for your servitude. But fail me now and my fury shall run like molten lead through the very marrow of thy bones.' The tattoo, now suppurating and giving off a sickly heat, concluded its speech by sending excruciating paroxysms of pain through Stone's body and dropping the 66-year-old to his knees."

'The complete lack of support for my candidacy among narrow interest groups like liberals, conservatives, and moderates tells me that America is hungry for an independent voice,' said Schultz, after preliminary polling found little to no support for his presidential bid among Democrats, African-Americans, evangelicals, working-class whites, suburbanites, Republicans, millennials, Hispanics, men, or women. 'Our political system has been overrun by people with opinions and ideas. This country should not be beholden to someone who constantly fights for American values. Our nation clearly wants an independent voice who does not speak for any of them. I know that I can win by rising above partisan squabbles by bringing together a large coalition of nobody whatsoever.' At press time, the announcement that Schultz was considering a presidential bid had received a highly positive reaction from Howard Schultz."

'The implication that I would expose our nation's most closely guarded intelligence without making serious bank is, frankly, insulting,' said Kushner, explaining that he had always been extremely cautious not to reveal any of the sensitive information he received to anyone but the highest bidder, as doing so could seriously devalue the intel. 'We are talking about national security matters with implications that could affect the lives of all Americans, which means I can basically charge whatever I want for it and still have buyers knocking down my door. I swear that I always made sure they paid through the nose.' Upon being questioned by reporters, Kushner admitted that he had occasionally been forced to offer discounts for state secrets due to dozens of other administration officials flooding the marketplace."

'Christ, it's so cold,' said the NBC News correspondent, who had reportedly been subsisting for the past several weeks on pieces of shoe leather and trapping the occasional cockroach that skittered across the briefing room floor. 'I've tried breaking down the door, but it's built of reinforced steel. Every now and then, I'll hear the sound of voices on the other side, and for the first few days, I was banging my fists against the door and screaming, 'Let me out, let me out,' but no one ever came by. I've given up. I'm starting to fear I'll have long since frozen to death by the time someone comes into this room again. God help me.' Alexander was reportedly grateful that the distraction of the fire kept him from thinking about his last full meal, which had consisted of a giant turkey leg with Jim Acosta's voice. "

'Let's just call everything before this moment a scratch and start fresh from the beginning: My name is Rudolph Giuliani, and I was born in East Flatbush in 1944,' said the former New York City mayor, staring off into the distance while calmly and carefully recalling his childhood and teen years growing up in Brooklyn during a new 45-hour appearance on Meet The Press wherein he attempted to iron out whatever details had been left murky by any of his previous statements to the media without mentioning any specifics that would further imply the guilt of his client, Donald Trump. 'I was a quiet, skinny kid from a hardworking blue-collar family. I was raised Roman Catholic and attended the Roman Catholic School St. Anne's. It's hard to believe a child from such humble origins would end up making his living working for the president of the United States and ensuring that his reputation is protected at any cost'actually, sorry, let's start over again.'

'Whether it's knocking on doors, leading focus groups, making phone calls, or helping prep me for upcoming media appearances, my entire staff will be comprised of unpaid prison laborers. Not only will this cut campaign-related expenses by up to $20 million, it will also allow inmates to spend time in the community and provide them with valuable work-related opportunities.' Harris added that due to a quirk in California state law, most inmates would be ineligible to work for other political campaigns once they'd been released from prison."

'Way back in the '80s, I already knew MLK Day would just be the first step by the powers that be to recast Dr. King's radical civil disobedience as some sort of bland and ineffective centrism,' said Grassley, who stressed that his greatest fear while voting was that there would come a day when politicians and corporations appropriated the famed activist's image for crass self-promotion. 'My sole motivation here was preventing the kind of future where people only pay lip service to some commercialized version of Dr. King without ever taking the time to truly understand his revolutionary vision. And yet here we are, in a world where the FBI is actually tweeting about him like the COINTELPRO surveillance operation never happened. What a travesty.' Grassley also noted he had only stayed silent on the issue since the vote because he believed anything anyone could possibly say about the famed orator and Baptist minister had already been said better by the great man himself."

'We must never rest until this fugitive is brought to justice, and the only way to achieve that is through repeated and prolonged military strikes on Iran.

'You've helped me out so far, and I appreciate that, but I've got my eye on you, Gates, so don't try anything stupid,' said Mueller, placing his gun on the table as the man who pleaded guilty to conspiracy against the United States and had since been aiding in the Russia investigation massaged his sore wrists, then opening the door to the motel room where Gates had been under lock and key for months. 'You track down my leads and get me what I want, and we'll keep this cordial. I don't trust you as far as I can throw you, Gates, but we're in this mess together, and dammit if you're not the only one who can get us out. But if you cross me, if you step even a toe out of line, you're finished. Remember that.' Mueller added that Gates better not even think of trying anything like the stunt Paul Manafort pulled and make a break for it right after the handcuffs were off, because it was only going to make things much, much worse for him in the long run."

'From the Rust Belt to the Sun Belt, across all income brackets and racial demographics, every single respondent surveyed came to the same conclusion that Colorado congressman Scott Tipton was solely at fault for this shutdown,' said lead researcher Michelle Sanger, who explained that the 24-hour news coverage broadcasting Tipton's failure to negotiate and compromise likely contributed to the U.S. populace's negative perceptions of the representative from Colorado's third district. 'As far as the American people are concerned, Tipton and Tipton alone owns this shutdown. And the more he continues to foist blame on others, the deeper the animus against him will grow. This will go down in the history books as the Tipton shutdown.' At press time, researchers said that the poll indicated a clear directive to representative Tipton to finally rise to the occasion, as only he alone can put an end the budget impasse."

'She can't just waltz in here with a list of demands from her constituents and do something about it. Christ, the fucking gall, thinking she can just represent the beliefs and desires of the people who elected her. She's out there holding town halls and tweeting about healthcare'who the hell does she think she is? Here's some advice, Debbie: Wait until you're a cynical, shallow husk of yourself, and only then will you be ready to properly govern. Otherwise, you keep your head down, you vote for what we put in front of you, and you fundraise.'

'As many as 75 percent of voters blame the country's issues on the leaders of the American Revolution for bringing the United States into existence, representing a 20 percent increase from a survey conducted last year,' said lead researcher Harriet Zipperman, noting that a majority of the electorate feels that matters ranging from presidential overreach, illegal immigration, wealth disparity, and governmental dysfunction can be traced directly to individuals including George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison for drafting the Declaration of Independence and ratifying the Constitution, which 62 percent of voters now view as a mistake. 'Our data reveal that three out of four voting-age Americans would characterize the framers' process of revolting from Britain and forming their own system of governance as 'completely bone-headed' and 'lacking in even the smallest amount of foresight,' and we only expect that number to grow as our politics become more and more contentious.' Zipperman added that the survey also revealed 55 percent of voters found fault with Abraham Lincoln for fighting to preserve the union. "

'It's weird because giving up is just sort of what I do.

'This distinguished committee must remain unblemished from this kind of hateful, divisive rhetoric so that it may continue to carry out the important work of subjugating those who are not descended from pure, Western European stock. The American people entrusted us to deliver on our sacred promise to create policies that isolate and disenfranchise minorities, and that's a promise that we intend to keep.'

'Mr. Barr, we recommend you eliminate the phrase 'His Excellency' from your testimony altogether,' said Chief Advisor Graham Johnson, who urged Barr to maintain an appearance of impartiality by abstaining from lying prostrate on the floor and muttering 'long may he reign' whenever the president's name was mentioned. 'We want to make sure you don't tip your hand on your views regarding presidential authority, so to that end, calling him 'The President' or simply 'Mr. Trump' is sufficient'there's no need to add titles like 'The Most High, Most Sacred, Most Powerful.' Additionally, we'd suggest you keep any opinions about Trump having been ordained from on high by God himself close to the vest.' Johnson further cautioned Barr that it could lead to poor optics if he greeted Trump during their next meeting by kissing the hem of the president's pant leg and swearing his undying fealty to the one true ruler."

'I just want to have two calm weeks where I don't even think about Individual One. I won't even say his name. I'll have to wait to hear about any important developments in January, since I just know the second I read, say, something about Eric being involved more deeply than we previously suspected, I'll get pulled back in and ruin my whole vacation.'

Administration criticized after its official women's health website removes all mention of women. John Bolton added to general sense of foreboding. That whole weird deal where we didn't see Melania for like two weeks. Nation finally resigns itself to the fact that it's always going to be like this. Trump's reckless Supreme Court nomination of alleged sexual predator Brett Kavanaugh is rejected by the upstanding members of the Republican Party in a brave stand for basic moral principles. At a rally in Houston, Trump describes himself as 'a nationalist' to six seconds of silence, then adds 'the nation is America' to 20 seconds of raucous cheering.

'I was wrong to take advantage of my position, and I hope the lustrous glazing and firing evident in this piece will move you to forgive me for my all-too-human failings. Please don't remember me as the man who used government funds on security detail for my family while we were on vacation in Turkey, or as the man who violated the Hatch Act and acted as a pawn for the oil and gas industry. Rather, when your eyes happen to fall on this unique example of kaolin clay-work, I hope you will remember me as the man who bought each of you the 2019 Mercedes Benz S560 sedans you'll find in the parking lot when you leave today.'

'We are looking into the deeply troubling accusations that the United States Senate has chosen to willfully and knowingly place fault for the murder of a dissident journalist on a Saudi crown prince,' said the president, claiming that no despot should be made to endure such inhumane treatment as the loss of military funding for an ongoing war in Yemen that has left millions homeless and starving, no matter whose dismemberment they may have ordered. 'Facing criticism like this on the international stage is, for a powerful leader such as bin Salman, basically torture, and we take this kind of mistreatment very seriously. This is not how Americans treat authoritarian regimes that purchase our weapons. Without billions of dollars in military aid, how is the Saudi regime supposed to maintain its basic standard of living?' The Trump administration is expected to charge all American senators with crimes against humanity for their role in holding the Saudi regime responsible for its actions."

'I acted so recklessly and made so many ill-advised decisions that I was sure they would catch me earlier, but thank goodness I'm in and can finally get my revenge on the feds. We have some trials ahead of us, but man, the second Davy and I fly the coop and breathe fresh air together'I know it's going to be the sweetest thing.'

'With this impenetrable forcefield, my administration is making good on our promise to keep drugs and rapists out of this country'the moment they even try to come into our country illegally, they'll be zapped into oblivion. In addition to the forcefield, we've also completed a system of floating bubbles with the ability to track down and eliminate any illegal immigrants who had previously made their way across the border.'

'When I started at the White House, we promised each other that we would still get down to the Potomac every now and then and go fishing. But we never went, not once, and the longer I'm here, the more I feel the two of us slipping further away from each other. Well, I'm not going to let that happen.' Kelly added that he would continue to be a sympathetic ear whenever Trump needed to get something off his chest about work, but from now on, he would be 'serving at the pleasure of friendship.'"

Bush funeral would go on an extended two-week run.

641,"Wisconsin Legislature Weakens Incoming Democratic Governor By Restricting His Access To Food, Water, Shelter","MADISON, WI'In an effort to prevent the state's newly elected leader from enacting his agenda, the Republican-controlled Wisconsin legislature was working to weaken incoming Democratic governor Tony Evers by restricting his access to food, water, and shelter, sources confirmed Wednesday. 'We must rein in the governor's unchecked power to feed, clothe, and house himself without first obtaining legislative approval,' said Republican State Assembly Speaker Robin Vos of the lame-duck legislature's recent flurry of bills, which place numerous restrictions on the governor's office and makes it a felony for anyone within Wisconsin's borders to provide Evers with a warm bed or medical aid. 'The current policy allows the governor far too much leeway in determining whether he has a roof over his head or enough nutrients to sustain the functioning of his vital organs, and these bills are really nothing more than checks on his basic civil rights. We'll see how effective the governor-elect's radical agenda is when he's starving, frostbitten, and too weak to hold a pen.' At press time, the Republican legislators had reportedly passed another bill enabling them to cripple the incoming governor with a tire iron."

'Unfortunately, all evidence indicates that Khashoggi was killed after only three or four hours of merciless beatings,' said Haspel in a damning summary of the Saudi death squad's 'relatively tame' treatment of the dissident journalist, adding that the group repeatedly missed out on opportunities for innovative torture. 'The bone saw was a nice touch, I guess, but all of our findings suggest that he was already dead before they even started dismembering him. It's shameful and outrageous how amateurish the Saudis' techniques were'frankly, the biggest crime here is that these cowards relied on such pathetic methods. It was clearly a rush-job, an absolute travesty of an interrogation, and as such, I condemn it completely.' Haspel added that, had she been responsible for such a 'hack' interrogation, she would be denying it as well."

'He's gonna think we're so sexy, and once we get him to fall in love, then we can reveal ourselves and make him drop the charges against Dad or else we'll tell everyone what happened. Watch out, Mueller. Donalina and Ericalina are coming for you!' At press time, the sobbing Trump boys were reportedly spotted racing through the halls of the White House pursued by Ivanka Trump waving a ripped $5,000 designer gown."
646,GOP-Controlled Wisconsin Legislature Votes To Dissolve State Rather Than Let Democrats Have It,"MADISON, WI'Passing the measure along party lines, the GOP-controlled Wisconsin legislature voted Tuesday to dissolve the 30th state admitted to the union rather than let governor-elect Tony Evers and other members of the Democratic Party have it. 'This essential legislation officially dismantles the State of Wisconsin, thereby ensuring Democrats, who won every statewide executive office on the ballot last month, will have no legal authority within its borders,' said Republican Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, explaining that it would be reckless to honor the fair election of Democrats to the state's executive branch and far preferable for Wisconsin to cease existing and become instead a lawless wasteland of snow and ice. 'While we cherish the past 170 years of statehood, there is simply too much at stake right now to allow the clear will of the people expressed at the polls to ruin Wisconsin by putting Democrats into positions such as governor and attorney general.' At press time, the Republican-led legislature had passed a follow-up resolution naming outgoing Governor Scott Walker the Eternal God-King of the former state of Wisconsin."

'After a very thorough review, we, the members of the House Raytheon caucus, voted to reject the bill outright,' said Stephen Hadley (R-RTN), chair of the influential House Subcommittee on Raytheon Products & Services, adding that the 286 Raytheon elected officials who hold an insurmountable majority in the House strongly disagreed with the Senate's effort to rein in American support of the Saudi Arabia'led war in Yemen. 'The Senate's move to withdraw U.S. troops and financial support from the Saudis is simply not in the best interest of our constituents, the majority of whom are hardworking Raytheon shareholders and Raytheon employees. We are not going to let the Senate make an ill-considered decision to destroy the carefully built relationship between the Saudis and the Raytheon people.' At press time, the House Raytheon executives had voted unanimously in favor of a new congressional resolution that would put the entire U.S. defense budget earmarked for the war in Yemen under Raytheon's direct control."

'We better pack some games so that we have fun stuff to do in prison. We could also maybe use my shovel to dig under the wall in a pinch.

'It seems like no one ever tells me the truth'what am I doing wrong? I mean, I'm not even that mad about all the collusion stuff; I'm just hurt that they don't respect me enough, to be honest,' said Mueller, who wiped away a tear while admitting that 'all the secrets and lies' had jeopardized his capacity to trust new people and damaged his personal relationships. 'I put my faith in these guys to be straight with me, but I suppose there's just something about me that makes people feel comfortable walking all over me. I guess I'm just a big pushover.' At press time, a despondent Mueller announced plans to step away from the investigation to take some time for personal reflection and figure out why this kept happening."
654,"Trump Insists Manafort, Assange Only Discussed How Bad Collusion Is","WASHINGTON'Downplaying reports that his former campaign chairman may have collaborated with the controversial Wikileaks founder in 2016, President Trump said Tuesday that Paul Manafort and Julian Assange did indeed meet on occasion to discuss how collusion was a bad thing they would 'never, ever' do. 'Sure, they met a few times, but the only thing they ever talked about was how much they hate collusion and anyone who participates in collusion,' the president told reporters, saying both Manafort and Assange had assured him their meetings in London's Ecuadorean embassy had been called for the sole purpose of outlining all the different ways people can engage in collusion and all the reasons why it was illegal and immoral to do so. 'I firmly believe this was nothing more than two good, honest men clarifying to each other how disgraceful it would be to coordinate their efforts to tamper with an election, because that sort of behavior is clearly wrong. They may also have spoken of how completely disgusted they would be if someone were to obtain the emails of an opponent's political campaign and then publish them. But that's it. The conversations stopped there.' Trump added that several other members of his campaign staff may have held meetings to iron out the details of their own firm anti-collusion stances, including his son Donald Trump Jr."

'This is a long-overdue piece of legislation that will help defend our country against the scourge of black people being in places and doing things,' said Rep. Steve King (R-IA) of H.R. 8164, which would penalize black Americans with a minimum of five years in prison and fines of up to $750,000 for any activity they happen to be engaged in whenever law enforcement arrives. 'This measure seeks to bring an end to overly permissive laws that, by allowing black people to simply hang around and do different stuff at will, places an undue burden on the police officers who want to arrest them and throw them in jail. While I believe this bill represents a good first step, we of course also need to enact legislation that outlaws anything Hispanics and Muslims might be doing at the moment.' At press time, sources confirmed House GOP leaders had called Capitol Police to report several African American representatives engaged in the suspicious activity of voting against the bill."

According to the statement, the first lady 'no longer deserves the honor' of serving in the position, which she has occupied since early 2017. The controversial memo went on to question the personal loyalty of the first lady to the president, going so far as to suggest she was someone widely viewed as 'untrustworthy' within the administration. Noting that Melania Trump had repeatedly complained about the first lady to White House chief of staff John Kelly, sources painted a portrait of an East Wing in disarray and in desperate need of a shake-up. The unprecedented call for the ouster of a first lady by Ms. Trump has fueled speculation that she enjoys a great deal of influence over her husband. At press time, anonymous White House sources confirmed that Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner had been meeting with possible first lady replacements for several months."

'I'm really looking forward to improving the vitality of our caucus by spending lots of time with these new representatives as I slowly drain the blood from their shackled, unconscious bodies and then inject the precious liquid into my own veins,' said the current House minority leader, her eyes going completely black as she voiced her appreciation for the diverse wave of African American, Latino, Native American, and Muslim representatives, as well as for the 'exquisite cocktail' of invigorating nutrients their blood would provide. 'America sent a powerful message when they voted to send fresh blood to Capitol Hill, and I have heard them loud and clear. We've already collected 27 liters of plasma, and I pledge to use every last drop of it to renew my life force so that I can remain the top-ranking Democrat until 2075.'

'I would never, under any circumstances, say something so despicable,' said King, who was recently elected to his ninth congressional term, adding that any accusations of him claiming migrants were human beings with rights, emotions, and cognitive development were completely false and crossed a line. 'Everyone who knows me knows that I've never believed that immigrants are people, and any suggestion otherwise is utterly baseless. It makes me sick to think that the media is trying to smear me by spreading lies that I think any immigrant or refugee should be considered a person who in any way deserves basic respect or legal protections. Don't you dare associate me with any monster who thinks that way.' At press time, King was vigorously denying claims that he had made the comment 'I want to respect all people' by declaring there wasn't a moral bone in his body. "

'As it became clear long ago that we as a nation would need to enter the WWE ring, when we needed them most, these heroes answered the bell. They endured chokeslams, flying elbows, and piledrivers, and many of them courageously laid the smackdown to protect the freedoms of this great nation. From the violent days of Attitude Era to today's comparative peace, our nation's courageous fighters served admirably in WWE, and today we salute them.'

'Legend has it that this land is home to a lost race of people living in complete isolation, and if I can manage to find them, I will be able to stereotype them in any way I choose,' said the machete-wielding commander in chief who was wearing a tan field jacket as he led a group of loyal Republican allies through the oppressively hot and humid thicket in search of the mythic tribe. 'This discovery could change everything. These people remain entirely untouched by any media coverage whatsoever, so I can easily stick them with the blame for our nation's drug problems, violent crime, stagnant wage growth, you name it.' Upon sighting the uncontacted tribe, Trump's reelection team reportedly took grainy black-and-white videos of them for immediate use in menacing campaign ads."

'It's clear that the integrity of this important election will be violated if Ms. Abrams remains in her obviously biased post as the Democratic candidate for governor,' said Ryan Mahoney, aide to the Brian Kemp campaign, adding that Kemp had resigned as Georgia's secretary of state two days after the election in order to avoid the appearance of partisanship and that it was only fair that Abrams recuse herself from her post as well. 'Ms. Abrams already displayed her appalling bias by appearing on the ballot as a Democrat in the first place, but stepping down as the candidate now would still allow the election to be decided fairly. We urge her not to indulge in blatant partisan behavior by manipulating the system so that all the votes are counted, and to do the honorable thing by giving up her candidacy.' Georgia GOP officials added that residents could avoid abetting Abrams' compromised position by not voting for her in a runoff election. "

'You will not stare and raise your finger at me like that, Father! I am the president of the United States no matter what you think! I make the rules now, and you mustn't defy me!' said Trump, raking his fingers down his face and straining his voice until it cracked as he pointed to an empty corner of the room and commanded a group of baffled aides to remove his long-dead father. 'This is a disgrace'there is no place in the White House for your judgment'get him out of here! And someone silence the voices, the thousands of voices. I can barely talk with their whispers filling my head, their laughter and whispers. Father, this is my house! Stop pointing at me!'

'Obviously, it's not ideal for a sitting president to have outstanding parking fines, but a lot of these are just BS street cleaning things, and honestly, he's probably not even guilty of some of them. I don't understand why he's so resistant to talking to me about, what, maybe a few hundred bucks at most? Now his kids are being brought into it, and I even had to talk to his campaign manager just to make sure it was his vehicle. This whole thing is making a mountain out of a molehill.' Mueller added that he would be happy to cut the amount President Trump owes in half just to get the whole thing over with."

'President Trump expects and even demands difficult questions from journalists, but for Acosta to infiltrate a hospital dressed as a nurse in order to plant explosives is simply beyond the pale,' said Sanders of the clip, which shows the White House correspondent standing outside pressing a remote detonator several times as a hospital explodes in the background. 'This is clear evidence that Acosta has shirked his journalistic responsibility by murdering scores of Gotham citizens, and it's even more outrageous given his track record of unhinged actions, including lighting a pile of money on fire with a cigar and robbing a bank at gunpoint with several masked accomplices. Banning Acosta from the press room is the only reasonable response for these clear lapses in judgment.' At press time, CNN had responded by holding a panel discussion featuring experts arguing over whether Sanders' denial represented an effective strategy for the Trump administration."

'He doesn't work out, he isn't handsome, and he certainly doesn't have an appealing personality or sense of humor. But he did manage to beat Beto at the polls, so maybe that's kind of hot? I don't know. Maybe if I picture him as being kind of like a sexy vampire? Oh God, no'no, that's definitely not going to help. This is really going take a lot of work.'

Money and racism still pretty effective campaigning tools. Landmark elections of first Muslim women, 986th white supremacist to Congress. Should probably bring snack to polling place next time. Republicans continue to owe victories to the tireless work of grassroots gerrymandering. To ensure a win in 2020, the Democrats should consider running either a far-left, center-left, moderate, or conservative candidate.

Pritzker was reportedly brainstorming new hobbies to blow his money on after winning the Illinois gubernatorial election. 'Shelling out $171 million of my own money to get elected governor was fun and all, but now that that's over and done with, it's time to think big and find some other stuff I can buy,' said Pritzker, adding that after spending his own and his family's vast wealth on starting an investment group with his brother, owning a horse farm in Wisconsin, purchasing a Lake Geneva vacation mansion, having a science center at the Milton Academy named after him, getting a building at the University of South Dakota named after his wife's parents, ensuring the Northwestern law school was named after his family, setting up charities to provide cover for funneling money into offshore accounts, bankrolling union-busting activities at companies he owns, sending his children to private school, heavily funding two Hillary Clinton presidential campaigns, giving over $2 million to Duke University, flying on private jets, and winning the governor's race, he was looking for a fun new diversion to help offload some more of his $3.4 billion fortune. 'It's definitely nice to be governor, but what I'm really looking for is something that requires me to pony up some serious moolah. After all, I only get to be governor of one state. I bought a bunch of Faberge eggs and a ton of the rarest luxury cars I could find, but that's not really doing it for me. I was talking to someone the other day who said I could buy an Egyptian mummy, so maybe I'll do that. Or I could buy up a bunch of vineyards, or a couple castles? Maybe I can use my time as governor to really get down to work on my dream of finally buying all of Da Vinci's works. I'd better think of something soon, though, since all this cash is really burning a hole in my pocket.' At press time, Pritzker had decided to order a full-scale reproduction of Venice in southern Illinois after realizing how much taxpayer money he would have fritter away."

682,Georgia Election Worker Assures Black Man Ballot Scanner Supposed To Sound Like Shredder,"LAWRENCEVILLE, GA'Insisting that the machine was operating exactly as intended, Georgia election worker Mitchell Hamlin reportedly assured a black man on Tuesday that the ballot scanner was supposed to sound like a shredder. 'Don't you worry, it's designed to sound like it's ripping your ballot into thousands of tiny pieces,' the election worker informed the middle-aged African American resident, adding that it was merely a coincidence that several white voters in front of him had been directed to insert their ballots into a different scanner. 'You should absolutely be hearing a constant whirring and shredding sound'that's the machine's way of telling you that your vote counts. And that bucket below where the ballot scanner is dropping strips of paper? That's simply the machine producing a receipt so we know it went through to the right place. Congratulations, you definitely voted today.' At press time, Hamlin stated that he could also confirm the man's registration for the 2020 election if he just handed over his driver's license."
683,Man Confused By Obscure Down-Ballot Measure About Deciding Who His Senator Should Be,"FORT WAYNE, IN'Growing increasingly frustrated as he attempted to cast his vote in the midterm elections despite a severe lack of clarity and transparency, citizen Geoff Barnes admitted Tuesday that he was deeply confused by an obscure down-ballot measure to determine the senator for his district. 'I don't even know who these people are or what this 'senator' thing is supposed to be, but I hate to just guess,' said Barnes, visibly annoyed at the ballot's lack of any explanation as to what exactly the measure comprised and the absence of any kind of key that might help him comprehend the (R) and (D) symbols appearing next to the accompanying names. 'I hate how they sneak these little things in at the end without giving you any information. Obviously, I know what I want done for the major issues, such as the dog park initiative and the new water reclamation substation, but who knows about this piddly stuff. Honestly, it's things like this that keep people from voting altogether.' Barnes ultimately decided to register his displeasure by writing in the pseudonym 'Joe Donnelly' instead."
684,Pros And Cons Of Compulsory Voting,"Only about 40 percent of eligible Americans vote in a typical midterm election and around 60 percent in a presidential election, leading some to suggest the U.S. follow other countries' lead and make voting compulsory, while critics warn it could have negative consequences. The Onion evaluates the pros and cons of making voting compulsory. Young Americans will discover the magic of county bond proposals. Golden opportunity to criminalize something new. Stickers! There's probably some way to combine voting with the lottery. Would more evenly apportion blame for nation's problems. Broader representation of nation's electorate. Lose sense of superiority you get over people who didn't vote. What's next, allowing dogs to vote? Ruins years of steady, patient disenfranchisement. Future candidate who campaigned to end mandatory voting would always win."
685,"North Carolina Voter In Heavily Gerrymandered District Somehow Voting For Montana Senate, Mayor Of Phoenix","GREENSBORO, NC'Admitting that it was difficult to keep up with all the different races, North Carolina voter Darin McDonough told reporters Tuesday that he was somehow voting for the Montana Senate and the mayor of Phoenix, AZ in his heavily gerrymandered district. 'Man, there is a lot of confusing stuff on here. I'm not really that familiar with the Wyoming governor's race, and I have no idea which of these Michigan judges to vote for,' said McDonough, who said the two candidates to represent his North Carolina district in Congress were listed as being a Nebraska Republican and a New Hampshire Democrat. 'I'm definitely voting yes on this ballot measure to legalize marijuana in North Dakota, but I'm not sure about approving a tax hike for this bridge in Mississippi. Maybe I'll just play it safe and vote straight party-line for city council in Pittsburgh, Lubbock, and Anchorage.' At press time, a judge had upheld the legality of McDonough's congressional district, which covers an acre-wide strip of land zig-zagging across the country."
686,Libertarian Candidate Worried After Latest Poll Shows Him 98 Points Behind,"HILLIARD, IA'Beginning to worry about his chances as he followed live Election Day media coverage, Libertarian Party House of Representatives candidate Maxwell Booth was reportedly concerned Tuesday after the latest polls showed him 98 points behind his competitors. 'We knew it would be a tough race, but I have to admit, the final polls showing I'm dozens of percentage points behind the other candidates doesn't fill me with a whole lot of confidence,' said Booth, who is running on the Libertarian Party ticket for the third consecutive election, stressing that polls showed him trailing his opponents by just 97 points as recently as last week. 'This poll does have a four-point margin of error, so it's entirely possible that I'm really receiving 4 percent or even 4.5 percent of the vote. It's an uphill battle, of course, but who knows if those polls really capture the enthusiasm of voters out there, like the campaign sign of mine that one of my volunteers saw on someone's lawn a few weeks ago. And if I can pull in .3 percent or even .4 percent of absentee ballots, I think we're looking at really exceeding the pollsters' expectations.' At press time, Booth and his three-person campaign staff were wondering if the election could tip their way after learning that early voting tallies had netted the candidate four votes."

688,Trump Boys Proud After Mailing In Hand-Drawn Republican Ballots To North Pole,"WASHINGTON'Stressing the importance of participating in the democratic process as envisioned by our nation's founders George Washington and Santa Claus, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. were reportedly proud Tuesday after mailing in hand-drawn Republican midterms ballots to the North Pole. 'We couldn't make it to the North Pole to talk to Santa in person this year, so we sent in centipede [sic] ballots so the elves and reindeer can count all the votes on them,' said Eric Trump of the ballots they wrote in crayon on construction paper, wadded up, and stuffed into envelopes addressed to 'Santa's Workshop' with hand-drawn 'Fast Class' stamps affixed to the paper with chewing gum. 'We voted for our dad, like, 50 times, and then we voted for all his friends so they get to win. And we made sure to be extra good these last couple weeks, because Santa is watching, and if you're naughty he won't count your votes. Just in case, we put milk and cookies in there for Santa, too.' At press time, the Trump boys were mailing armfuls of ballots by dropping the soggy, tape-covered envelopes into a White House recycling bin."
689,Man Wishes There Were Some Kind Of Pre-Midterm Race Where Voters Could Select Better Candidates,"WARMINSTER, PA'Claiming he simply didn't connect with any of the people running for office this year, voter Carson Smith voiced his desire Tuesday for some kind of pre-midterm election race where voters could choose from better candidates. 'I would have loved a chance, say, four or five months before the midterms, to see a wide selection of office-seekers, look at their positions on the issues, and figure out who belongs on the ballot,' said Smith, explaining that he would feel far more invested in the electoral process if he could better weigh his options from a larger pool rather than just one candidate per party. 'I guess it should probably be organized by the Republican and Democratic parties. Like, we see a bunch of different people, but then pick our primary guy.' Smith also wished for some manner of public forum in which candidates could discuss their ideals and goals in the presence of a moderator."

691,Nation Begs For Midterms To Be Pushed Back To Delay Start Of 2020 Presidential Campaigns,"WASHINGTON'Saying they just wanted a short breather before having to dive right back into national politics, Americans begged Monday for the midterm elections to be pushed back to delay start of the 2020 presidential bids. 'Please, the later you can schedule the general elections, the more time we'll have until we turn on the TV and inevitably see that first candidate kick off their campaign for the White House,' said 325 million Americans, adding that even just putting a few more days of padding before the midterms would let them rest before having to endure two straight years of nonstop presidential campaigning. 'Honestly, the idea of casting a ballot tomorrow and then immediately getting hit with 12 presidential hopefuls who will never even make it past primaries is way too much to handle. So, if someone could please just close down the polls until after the holidays, it would really be appreciated.' At press time, the nation added that it would even be fine to push midterms as far back as 2020 because they already knew the current sitting president was just going to get reelected anyways. "
692,New Trump Campaign Ad Claims That Illegal Immigrants Currently Murdering You With Knife,"WASHINGTON'Drawing the ire of critics who decried the spot as 'misleading' and 'racially charged,' a new campaign ad released Friday by President Trump claimed that illegal immigrants are currently murdering you with a knife. 'Thousands of homicidal MS-13 members have already poured over the Southern border and are at this very moment stabbing you repeatedly in the torso and stomach with a butcher's knife,' said the ad, which urged voters to use the remainder of their strength to crawl to their nearest polling location before they bled out. 'Several arteries have already been punctured, but before these monsters end your suffering they're dragging your loved ones into the basement to flay them alive in front of you. You're presently struggling against your restraints, but there's nothing you can do. Soon you will begin to black out from despair and pain. The last thing you see in your final moments is Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer standing over you, laughing maniacally.' At press time, numerous Trump supporters had praised the ad for finally telling the truth about how they themselves had been killed by immigrants."
693,White House Concerned Ryan Zinke Made Land Deal Without Giving Cut To Trump,"WASHINGTON'Confirming the administration had launched a Justice Department investigation into the U.S. secretary of the interior's conduct, the White House revealed Friday that it was concerned Ryan Zinke had made a land deal without giving a cut to President Trump. 'Mounting evidence indicates that Secretary Zinke may have acted improperly by making money off of a private land development deal without letting President Trump wet his beak,' said White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, confirming that Zinke's role in the development of a business and retail park near land in Montana that he and his wife own may have run afoul of White House rules for skimming some profits off the top for the president. 'At no time did Mr. Zinke inform us about which Trump Organization bank account he would be depositing the president's kickback into, nor have we received an envelope full of unmarked bills slipped under the Oval Office door. We are extremely disappointed that the secretary would use his office to enrich himself without also enriching the president.' White House officials added that while they were committed to investigating Zinke for potential impropriety, they wanted to reassure Americans that the vast majority of federal employees always followed protocol in giving a cut of the profits from their private-sector hustles to the president."
694,Midterms 2018: Key Senate Races To Watch,"There are 35 Senate seats up for reelection in the 2018 midterms, most of which are currently held by Democrats, while the Republicans are trying to hold onto their two-seat majority. The Onion takes a look at the key Senate 2018 races to watch. Have Democrats finally found the perfect foil for Ted Cruz in young longshot candidate Guy Who Is Not Ted Cruz? As the only Republican incumbent facing reelection in a state won by Hillary Clinton, Heller has the unique opportunity to demonstrate just how bad Democrats are at winning elections. Whether they want to or not, Arizona's getting their first female senator. Heitkamp is trying to convince North Dakota voters she's the type of 'cool' Democrat who's still totally down to ease banking regulations once in a while. Lawrence is gonna do the best he can, okay? Manchin hopes to retain his seat by touting his Democratic Party bona fides of how many past political stances he's distanced himself from. Republican challenger Hawley vowed that his commitment to states' rights extends to continuing to fight for Missouri after the United States is formally dissolved. Ah shit, which one did Taylor Swift endorse again? It's the Republican governor versus the Democratic incumbent to determine who gets to represent what's left of Florida in Congress."

696,Brian Kemp Campaign Energized After Seeing Early Voter Suppression Numbers,"ATHENS, GA'Saying that the data heralded a promising outcome for election day, representatives from Brian Kemp's gubernatorial campaign were reportedly energized Thursday after perusing early voter suppression numbers. 'It's very exciting to see that with five days to go before the election, thousands of Georgians have already unsuccessfully attempted to cast their ballots,' said communications director Ryan Mahoney, noting that while these figures were not entirely predictive, they indicated a strong likelihood that the number of minority voters turned away at polling places would be extremely high on Nov. 6. 'We still have our work cut out for us, obviously, but the more people who are prevented from casting mail-in or provisional ballots ahead of time, the more resources we can expend towards keeping down the vote next week. So far, our expectations have been wildly exceeded, and if these trends continue, we may be seeing suppression levels that haven't been reached since the 1950s.' Mahoney also urged Republican voters in urban areas to assist the campaign by making a plan to intimidate their friends and neighbors this upcoming Tuesday."

698,Poll Finds 2018 Midterms Resting On Critical Swing Group Of People Who Showed Up Looking For Community Center Pottery Class,"WEST LONG BRANCH, NJ'Noting that the notoriously hard-to-predict voting bloc will be critical to success on election day, a Monmouth University poll released Thursday found that the 2018 midterms will likely be decided by Americans who arrive at the community center looking for a pottery class. 'Data from past elections clearly indicate that approximately 25 percent of midterm voters initially show up at elementary schools, churches, or community centers in order to participate in adult education classes,' said lead researcher Matthew Ellis, noting that these voters generally trend older, are more likely to be financially secure, and share a moderate to serious interest in expanding their wheel throwing skills. 'The balance of power in the House, and perhaps the Senate, will likely come down to how many people arrive at their polling place looking for real-world answers about glazing techniques. These are voters who want to know: Is my instructor sick? Why is the gym full of folding tables? Am I going to be able to make my coffee mug next week? Whichever party can give them the answers they need is going to have a really great night.' Ellis acknowledged that turnout among the notoriously unpredictable prenatal yoga demographic would be election night's biggest question mark."
699,Political Scientists Trace American Democracy's Severe Polarization To Fucking Idiots On Other Side Of Aisle,"DURHAM, NH'Blaming those with a differing worldview for sowing rampant discord in society, political scientists at the University of New Hampshire announced Wednesday they had traced the current polarization in American democracy to those fucking idiots on the other side of the aisle. 'The analysis we conducted indicates the growing divide in political attitudes has been entirely caused by those dipshits in the other party,' said Dr. Stanley Pomeroy, adding that all these goddamn slobbering imbeciles and the biased media outlets they call news are primary drivers of the nation's movement toward ideological extremes. 'Our research clearly shows that ignorant assholes on the opposing side who never leave their personal echo chambers make the political sphere more contentious by continually spouting off stupid fucking opinions about issues they don't even understand. Until these shit-for-brains voters stop casting their ballots for the wrong party, it's unlikely things will get any better.' At press time, Pomeroy stressed that the only way to reverse the troubling effects of polarization was for the dumbfucks on the other side to disregard all their life experiences and change everything about the way they think."
700,Midterms 2018: Key House Races To Watch,"Many of the 435 U.S. House of Representatives midterm races are currently polling as toss-ups, with Democrats needing to win at least 24 extra seats to take back the House. The Onion takes a look at the key House races to watch in the midterms. Democrat McGrath, the first woman to fly F-18 combat missions for the Marine Corps, is somehow in a tight race with incumbent Republican Andy Barr, who has never even once killed for his country. Incumbent Republican Paulsen has been notably critical of Donald Trump and wrote in Marco Rubio for president in 2016, though it's unclear why he thinks that's something to be proud of. Democrat Porter is challenging incumbent Republican Walters on an unapologetically progressive message that will serve as the final, irrefutable test of whether a left-wing platform can resonate with voters. All Republican Miller needs to do to beat Democrat Ojeda is convince voters how fucking awesome it will be to have a bison farmer as their representative. Look, you'll figure this out for sure before Election Day, okay? It's been a busy few months. Republicans in this race are experimenting with the novel strategy of trying to appeal to voters who may be uncomfortable with the Democratic candidate's ethnicity. Democrats hope to stave off the challenge by the former federal law enforcement officer and CIA operative funded by real estate interests who...wait, that's the Democrat? Christ. Why are they so bad at this? Over 1,900 residents have already been hospitalized for respiratory issues and second-degree chemical burns resulting from Democrat Kim's efforts to turn the district blue. One of a number of thrilling, nail-biter races across the country that will likely come down to whether Trump happens to say something especially morally reprehensible within 24 hours of Election Day."
701,Trump Turns On Fox News And Tells Aides To Make Whatever They're Saying A Law,"WASHINGTON'Demanding aides write down every single word from the morning's Fox & Friends broadcast, President Trump turned on Fox News Tuesday and directed his staff to take everything its anchors were saying and make it into a law, White House sources confirmed. 'Whatever they're talking about right now, just draft it up and put it on my desk so I can sign it,' said Trump as he reportedly rewound the TiVo in the Oval Office dining room and replayed a sound bite from Steve Doocy that is expected to become the law of the land by the end of the week. 'There's a lot of really good material here'you've got the caravan, stuff about guns, ISIS'make sure you get it all down. You hear the places where they're chuckling? Put that in there, too. I want everything.' At press time, sources said the president's aides were handing him a final draft of an executive order that appeared to be a verbatim 60-page transcription of Your World With Neil Cavuto, complete with the text of several ads for IHOP and Sandals Resorts."
702,Trump Claims He Can Overrule Constitution With Executive Order Because Of Little-Known 'No One Will Stop Me' Loophole,"WASHINGTON'Saying his latest executive order was legal due to an 'underutilized but totally feasible workaround,' President Trump claimed Tuesday that he could overrule the U.S. Constitution by means of the relatively obscure 'no one will stop me' loophole. 'My critics say a constitutional amendment or at least an act of Congress is necessary to end birthright citizenship, but what they don't realize is that a seldom-evoked administrative guideline ensures I can do whatever I want, whenever I want, because zero people will stand in my way,' said Trump, adding that the largely unheard-of clause allows him to circumvent normal legal proceedings because it's not like anyone in any branch of government remains effective enough to prevent him from doing so. 'Though few modern presidents have made use of it, this loophole has always given the nation's chief executive unilateral power over the Constitution. Its provisions dictate that the president can sidestep any checks and balances on his power once he has abused his authority so many times that no one can keep track anymore.' Trump added that while his opponents may try to challenge his executive order in court, the loophole also states that by then he will have achieved his immediate political aims."
703,Voter Just Needs To Know Which Candidate Chops Wood In A Flannel Shirt,"GOODRICH, MI'In an effort to make an informed decision for the upcoming midterm elections, local voter Tom Richardson told reporters Tuesday that he just needs to know which candidate chops wood in a flannel shirt. 'You really have to dig through all the generic talking points and policy positions in order to find out whether the Democrat or the Republican candidate splits logs in a thick plaid button-up,' said Richardson, noting that while he has seen some political commercials in which candidates are wearing flannel and walking around outdoors, none of the ads definitively answer whether they chop firewood in woolen thermal wear or are completely unqualified for the position. 'I don't know why these politicians can't focus on the important issues in their campaign mailers instead of yapping about healthcare. Just show me whether you stand for felling trees and building a woodpile in your checkered shirt so I'm not in the dark when I get inside the voting booth.' At press time, a visibly frustrated Richardson had decided to vote for the candidate who had posed for a photo next to a lit fireplace."

705,Trump Slams Worldwide Jewish Conspiracy For Not Doing More To Prevent Synagogue Shooting,"WASHINGTON'In the aftermath of a shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue that left 11 people dead, President Donald Trump reportedly slammed the worldwide Jewish conspiracy Monday for not doing more to prevent the violent attack. 'I condemn in the strongest possible terms the shadowy global cabal of Jewish people who, despite the fact that they control everything on Earth, weren't even able to stop a single shooter,' said Trump in a press conference, adding that he didn't understand why the worldwide Jewish conspiracy didn't simply hypnotize the killer through the television or create a massive storm that would have stopped him from leaving his house. 'This entire tragedy could have been avoided if the Jews had simply manipulated the global economy and the banks to ensure that the shooter didn't have enough money to afford a gun or ammunition. It is an absolute shame that the worldwide Jewish plot failed to telepathically communicate the imminent danger to the people in the building, or use their minds to erect an invisible, impenetrable barrier around the entire synagogue.' Trump ended his speech by calling for unity in the worldwide Jewish conspiracy to prevent future anti-Semitic hate crimes with their mystical powers."
706,Trump Boys Smash Father's Cell Phone To Search For Chinese Spies,"WASHINGTON'Eric and Donald Trump Jr. reportedly smashed their father's cell phone Friday to search for Chinese spies, shouting demands that the tiny operatives come out of the receiver with their hands up. 'When we heard all these little Chinese guys snuck into our dad's phone and started listening to all the things he talks about, we knew we had to find out wherever they've been hiding,' said Donald Jr. moments before bringing a hammer down on their dad's iPhone and taking turns stomping on the shards with his brother to 'smoosh the little imbisible spies [sic].' 'Now they gotta stop taking secret stuff. And they'll never ever break out of this jar jail we made for them'even if we did poke holes in the top part so they could breath. Dad's gonna be so proud when we show him!'At press time, an exhausted Eric and Donald Jr. were taking a break from a lengthy session of interrogating the badly broken fragment of their father's phone."
707,Midterms Predicted To Have Largest Voter In Decades,"CLIFTON, NJ'Citing the nationwide surge in growth of the average American registered to cast a ballot over the past several years, political researchers working for SurveyUSA predicted this week that the 2018 midterm elections will likely feature the largest voter in decades. 'If growth trends continue, we can expect a truly massive voter to turn out, something that is especially remarkable given that this is a non-presidential year,' said data scientist Ryan Martinez, who noted that the intensity of the issues under consideration could result in the attendance of a voter double the size of the norm. 'You can really feel a sense of urgency rising among this substantial unit of traditionally overserved constituent, possibly because of the implications to healthcare, and we feel a movement is building that will see him leave the house to vote for the first time since 2008.' At press time, Martinez confirmed that a petition had been filed for an extended voting booth to accommodate the massive constituent. "
708,Man Just Knows Hillary Clinton Going To Have Opinion On Not Dying In Explosion,"SPRINGFIELD, IL'Saying he wished the former presidential candidate would 'shut up and go away for once,' area man Justin Irsay told reporters Wednesday that he 'just knows Hillary Clinton is going to have an opinion' on not dying in a pipe-bomb explosion. 'Oh God, she's going to be out there spouting some comments and making this all about her,' said Irsay, growing increasingly agitated as he imagined Clinton's likely response to the homemade explosive device mailed to her home and addressed to her personally. 'She can't let anything go. The election was two years ago, for christsakes! It's like, 'Hey, Hillary'you lost. Can you get off my TV now?' Jesus.' Irsay went on to state that dwelling on serial pipe bombings all the time would likely cost Democrats the 2020 election."
709,Chuck Schumer Relieved He's Never Taken Stance Meaningful Enough To Have Someone Mail Him Explosive,"WASHINGTON'Following reports that incendiary devices had been sent to Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and George Soros, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer expressed relief Wednesday that he has never taken a stance meaningful enough to inspire someone to mail him an explosive. 'Phew, this is where constantly equivocating and avoiding any issue that's even remotely controversial really pays off,' said Schumer (D-NY), adding that he was thankful his persistent lack of political courage had all but guaranteed no one would ever be angry enough with him to 'do something crazy or violent.' 'I really dodged a bullet there! Hopefully if I just keep my head down and stay focused on tacitly supporting the status quo, I'll keep out of the line of fire.' At press time, Schumer had issued a tepid statement urging Americans to consider all sides in the matter."
710,Midterms 2018: Gubernatorial Races To Watch,"There are 36 governor seats up for election in the 2018 midterms, as Democrats seek to make up ground against the Republicans, who currently control two-thirds of the posts nationwide. The Onion presents a guide to the most important gubernatorial races in 2018. Despite his lack of charisma and unpopular policies, Walker has managed to connect with Wisconsinites by spending millions of dollars on television ads. The Republican candidate happens to be in charge of voting in the state, and there's nothing unusual or suspicious about that, so just stop worrying, okay? After a bruising primary, Republican Molinaro faces incumbent Republican Governor Cuomo. The amount of time both candidates have spent in Iowa has led many pundits to speculate they may each be plotting a future presidential run. Democrat Pritzker is leading in the polls over incumbent Rauner, paving the way for Illinois' governorship to get upgraded from a millionaire to a billionaire. The country is keeping a close eye on this race in the hopes of discovering how many sexist and racist things a candidate can say before Maine elects a woman. Sutton is a former professional bronco rider, which may not have anything to do with governing but is nonetheless pretty badass. As the campaign for the top spot in Ohio government heats up, the race for Ohio governor is absolutely pitting two Ohioans against each other. In some ways, it's coastal Florida versus the panhandle, but in one major way, it's a white racist versus a black guy."

'All I want is to be able to check my makeup without awakening an ancient evil, causing the floorboards to shake and glasses of water to freeze solid,' said the first lady, lamenting the fact that since moving into the White House, she had constantly been faced with a barrage of demonic whispers coming from within the walls and a swarm of locusts that seemed to appear out of thin air. 'Just the other day, I saw myself in a windowpane, and the sky immediately turned blood-red, several birds fell from the sky, and my reflection turned into a skeleton. It's just so irritating'48 hours later and my ears still haven't stopped ringing.' At press time, the first lady was nowhere to be found after she reportedly looked into a mirror, saw a fiery portal open up behind her, and was sucked in with a deafening scream."

'As we've seen numerous times, the president has a tendency to stretch the veracity of objective fact, but we're confident that we'll have finished fully assessing the truthfulness of his claims within the next several decades,' said PolitiFact researcher Gregory Wu, stressing that the country's fact-checkers wanted to take their time and thoroughly vet all declarations made by the president in order to ensure that they could compile a complete list of corrections within the next half century. 'We're working around the clock, which is why we're currently on pace to finish fact-checking everything President Trump said during his first 100 days in office by the late 2020s. It's crucial for us to carefully examine every word and phrase in order to determine whether the president is deliberately lying and using false information, or whether he simply misspoke or was taken out of context. By 2050, we expect to have fact-checked every one of President Trump's public statements, interviews, state speeches, and extemporaneous remarks so that American voters can make an informed decision about the president's relationship with the truth.' At press time, a new speech at a campaign rally by Trump had forced the fact-checkers to push back their deadline to 2075."

'I promise you this, folks'if anybody here knocks the crap out of Ted Cruz, I will pay whatever it costs,' said Trump to raucous cheering from the Toyota Center audience as he demonstrated several moves, including a body slam, a chokehold, and an uppercut punch, that a supporter could use on the one-term senator. 'I mean, just look this guy. That's a real bad dude, folks, and he's just asking for it. We don't want this kind of guy here at this rally, believe me. Six figures, seven figures'I don't care how much. I'll pay for it. If you want to take a swing at him right now, be my guest.'

'C'mon, I can barely make out what Trump's talking about,' said Cruz, leaning forward in his seat in section 417 to better see whether the president's rally appearance in support of him was going well or not. 'I think that little speck next to him on the stage is my wife and kids? But back here, who knows? God, I just hope they're saying good things about me.'

'The American people deserve to know exactly where I stand in regards to financial interests, so to be completely open and transparent, I will become a member of the House of Saud,' said Kushner, who will henceforth be known as Prince Jared bin Charles. 'In addition to renouncing my citizenship, I have decided to sell all of my U.S. properties, divorce my wife, and marry the eldest daughter of Prince Faisal bin Salman. Furthermore, I have made a $2.5-million donation to the country's most selective Wahhabist school to ensure the acceptance of my heirs. Through all of this, I have been and will remain a senior advisor to President Trump.' At press time, bin Charles reportedly drove off in a gold-plated 2019 Lamborghini Aventador."

717,New Ted Cruz Attack Ad Declares Beto O'Rourke Too Good For Texas,"AUSTIN, TX'Emphasizing that the state had done nothing so far to merit anything besides the status quo, a new attack ad released Thursday by incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz declared that his challenger, Rep. Beto O'Rourke, was 'too good' for Texas. 'He's charismatic, he's good-looking, he's clearly a nice guy'and frankly, you don't deserve someone like that,' says Cruz during the 30-second TV spot, in which he is seen sitting on a living room sofa with his wife and children who stare silently into the camera and intermittently nod in agreement. 'If you elect him, he's going to come in here, listen to what you have to say, and then incorporate that into the way he governs. What makes you think you've done anything to earn that kind of treatment? I mean, if you really have your heart set on somebody who is well-liked and wants to work to bring all Texans together, then go ahead, vote for him. But that's not what Texas stands for'at least not the Texans I represent.' The ad then closes with a close-up on the senator's face and the appearance of a new slogan, 'Ted Cruz: What Texas Has Coming To It.'"
718,Melania Trump's Plane Forced To Make Emergency Landing After Smoke Begins Billowing Out Of First Lady,"WASHINGTON'In what is being described as a 'close call' for the aircraft's passengers and crew, sources reported that Melania Trump's plane was forced to turn around and make an emergency landing Wednesday after thick plumes of smoke began billowing out of the first lady. 'There was a strong burning smell, and as soon as we noticed the black smoke venting out of Mrs. Trump's eye sockets and ear canals, we realized something was seriously wrong,' said crewmember Anton Chapman, adding that, despite routine maintenance checks of the first lady to prevent such incidents, occasional mishaps could still occur, especially when internal regulating systems malfunctioned. 'Smoke started filling the cabin, and several members of the press pool began choking and gagging as we tried to contain the damage. Unfortunately, there was very little we could do before the fumes surrounding Mrs. Trump ignited and she burst into flames. Several staffers were severely impaired in the blast, and we had to make an emergency landing.' At press time, witnesses confirmed a crew of firefighters at the landing site was attempting to put out the still-burning first lady."
719,Homemade DNA Test Proves Trump Boys Are At Least One Jar Blood,"WASHINGTON'Providing vital new insight into their ancestral roots, a homemade DNA test self-administered by Eric and Donald Trump Jr. Wednesday proved definitively that they are both at least 'one jar blood.' 'I always figured I was at least half a jar blood, and now we got the proof,' said Donald Trump Jr., visibly pale, covered in blood, and reportedly feeling 'woozy' in the aftermath of the test that he and his brother had just completed, using a metal protractor to cut open their palms and two discarded mason jars they found in the trash. 'Eric is part blood, too, which makes sense, 'cuz we're brothers. Dad is going to be so proud when he hears how much blood we have in us. I bet we have a lot of the same blood as him, too, since he's our dad. I bet we even have one jar of his blood and one jar of mommy's blood in us. We'll just have to keep testing our TNA [sic] to make sure!' At press time, a groggy Eric Trump was washing down a chocolate chip cookie with a big swig of blood."

'Y'all critters ain't welcome in this here polling place'go on, get!' said commission member Greg Duckett, using a garden hose to remove a thick accumulation of spiderwebs from an electronic voting machine that, according to reports, has also been home to a small family of raccoons since the 2016 general election. 'I don't know how we're gonna get all these voting booths gussied up by Nov. 6. At this point, I've swept more squirrel nests out of ballot boxes than I can rightly count.

'The potential murder of a high-profile journalist critical of their regime raises grave concerns for us, and we appeal to the leaders of Saudi Arabia to restrict their extrajudicial murders to Yemeni people who don't have any public platform,' said President Trump, adding that the White House would not sit idly by as the Saudis caused the deaths of innocent people unless they were Yemeni children in a school bus or a group of Yemeni people attending a wedding. 'The United States asks Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to content himself with killings that don't affect business deals or call our diplomatic ties into question, such as airstrikes on Yemeni infrastructure, fueling mass cholera outbreaks, or blocking food and medical supplies from reaching civilians. Look, we don't even mind if you dismember and murder people inside the Turkish consulate, as long as they're unknown Yemenis whose deaths won't cause an international scandal. For the sake of all parties, we demand that the Saudis only kill people who hardly anyone in America cares about.' At press time, several major U.S. newspapers had published editorials praising the Trump administration for its tough stance on Saudi Arabia."

'It was so scary! The bad man told me that telling lies to Congress and asking for stuff from foreign nationals were big crimes and that I had to be at court in 30 days,' whimpered a terrified Trump Jr. while climbing under the covers with his favorite stuffed animal so he could hide from 'the mean and evil special probscooter [sic].' 'It felt so real, Dad. I want to stay here with you. You're going to protect me and make sure he doesn't get me, right, Dad? He said he had enough proof to send me away to jail for a long, long time. And that you wouldn't even try and pardon me.' At press time, the president was heard yelling obscenities after he awoke to discover his eldest son had wet the bed."
728,Report: Many States Still Relying On Outdated Methods To Disenfranchise Voters,"WASHINGTON'Urging Congress to take action before the entire system was compromised, the Federal Election Commission warned Thursday that many states were still relying on outdated methods to disenfranchise their voters. 'The fact that a number of polling places across the country are still trying to purge voter rolls by hand is a huge issue,' said FEC spokesperson Angela Larson, noting that every state should have adopted fail-safe, digital disenfranchisement systems years ago. 'We've had reports of officials manually throwing ballots in the garbage, and, frankly, that is completely absurd in 2018. The manpower something like this takes is ridiculous. Electronic voting machines should be getting hacked remotely to eliminate even the slightest possibility of a paper trail. Don't even get me started with Georgia, where they're still relying on draconian registration laws and inaccessible polling places to suppress the black vote the same way their parents and grandparents did.' At press time, Larson cautioned that many of these antiquated methods were rife for human error and could result in thousands of minorities being allowed to vote."
729,"Calm, Measured Trump Hard At Work After Freak Accident Leaves Him With Railroad Spike Lodged In Skull","WASHINGTON'Logging countless hours in the Oval Office between warmly greeting foreign diplomats, an unusually serene and well-spoken President Trump was hard at work Thursday, industriously shepherding environmental and civil rights bills through Congress just days after a freak accident left a railroad spike lodged into his skull. 'President Trump has been a model of professionalism ever since the accident'he's attentive and inquisitive during intelligence briefings, articulate at press conferences, and his tweets have been increasingly vetted and thoroughly researched,' said White House chief of staff John Kelly, echoing the general sentiments of staffers in the West Wing, where feelings of general relief and a newfound sense of job security were observed during the two-hour morning meeting Trump convened to discuss naming Ada Limn the new U.S. poet laureate. 'At first I was a bit concerned, as anyone would be when a railroad spike pierces a sitting president's cerebral cortex and bisects his hypothalamus, but the White House physician checked him out and concluded that the benign effect on Trump's disposition outweighs any possible long-term harm.' At press time, staffers confirmed Trump was growing morose and irritable after banging the protruding head of the spike on the doorframe of Air Force One while attempting to deplane."
730,New Polls Increase Fears That Midterm Elections Will Be Won By Wave Of Politicians,"WASHINGTON'Causing dread and consternation among significant swaths of registered voters, a series of Reuters-Ipsos polls released Tuesday increased fears that the 2018 midterm elections will be won by a wave of politicians. 'Right now, many Americans are worried that the 2018 elections could be an absolute landslide for politicians, and everything we're seeing seems to suggest that this is a very real cause for concern,' said McGill University political analyst Tasha Martin, warning that every predictor released by major polling organizations pointed to a 'near-tsunami' of midterm gains for politicians and political figures, groups notorious for being selfish, out of touch with the general public, and corruptly bending to outside interests. 'In fact, most predictions offer a nearly 100 percent chance that politicians will win both the House and Senate in November. For most Americans, seeing politicians completely in control of Congress might be enough to cause them to lose all faith in democracy.' Martin added that preliminary polling also raised the frightening specter of a politician taking the White House in 2020."
731,Nikki Haley Resigns To Accept Consulting Role With Afghan Warlord,"NEW YORK'Saying she hoped the new position would allow her to grow both personally and professionally, Nikki Haley announced Tuesday she would resign from her post as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in order to accept a consulting role with an Afghan warlord. 'While I have greatly enjoyed my time in the Trump administration, this opportunity fits my skill set so well that I felt I couldn't pass it up,' said Haley, adding that the job with a warlord she declined to name would permit her to continue in her career path while pursuing her passions for paramilitary operations, intimidation, propaganda, and torture. 'I'm thrilled to begin this new adventure working alongside a true strongman, someone I have long admired for his ability to get things done. I believe the role I played at the U.N. has provided me with the experiences I need to help him consolidate his power and expand his reign of terror, putting him in a better position to take control of his war-torn homeland.' Haley went on to express her hope that with a little hard work, she could help her new employer become the next Butcher of Kabul."
732,Saudis Insist Missing Journalist Was Already Dismembered Before He Left Consulate,"RIYADH, SAUDI ARABIA'Claiming that they could not have played a part in the disappearance, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman issued a statement Monday insisting that the exiled journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who went missing last week, had already been dismembered before he left the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. 'According to all reliable sources available at the embassy, Khashoggi's armless and legless torso was seen leaving the consulate on Thursday,' read the statement, adding that this claim could be backed up by security camera footage showing the journalist's severed right arm exiting a first-floor elevator earlier the same day, as well as several eyewitnesses who spotted chopped-up body parts hailing a taxi outside of the consulate that afternoon. 'Though Khashoggi was a frequent critic of our regime, we can attest that his murder and dismemberment could not have been the work of the Saudi government. The timeline simply doesn't match up. All we know is that the journalist was covered in blood and missing a lot of limbs when he arrived at the consulate on Tuesday and then left on Thursday'whatever happened to him after that remains a mystery to us. Really, we were stuck cleaning up after him. It was kind of rude to come in and leave a big mess everywhere.' At press time, the journalists reporting on this story had been dismembered."

734,Senator Feinstein Wondering If Now A Good Time To Disclose 7 Highly Credible Murder Allegations Against Kavanaugh She Received Weeks Ago,"WASHINGTON'Weighing the importance of the information against the potential political fallout, Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) debated Friday whether or not now might be a prudent time to introduce into discussion the seven highly credible murder accusations against Brett Kavanaugh that were given to her in August. 'Roughly five weeks ago, the family members of five slain women and two men presented me with dozens of file boxes full of concrete, corroborated evidence that Kavanaugh was personally and solely responsible for the deaths, and I'm now experiencing a strong feeling that maybe the other Senators, the media, and the American public should know,' said Feinstein, who also disclosed that dozens of people had come forward with information further connecting Kavanaugh to a string of brutal stranglings committed from 1986 to 2011, but had been turned away over concerns that it wasn't relevant to the confirmation process. 'His fingerprints are all over the crime scenes, there is DNA evidence from blood he left, and there are three dozen eyewitnesses. But information like that could really energize the Republican base, so you can see my dilemma here.' At press time, Feinstein had decided to sit on the evidence until a more politically expedient time."
735,Kavanaugh Blasted For Destroying Reputation Of Good Man,"WASHINGTON'Decrying the tactics as a smear campaign against an exemplary judge, Republicans blasted Brett Kavanaugh Friday for destroying the sterling reputation of a good man. 'It's despicable that this individual waited until the 11th hour to engage in offensive, partisan attacks in an attempt to discredit a decent and upstanding man,' said Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA), noting that Kavanaugh's recriminations had repeatedly made a mockery of the entire confirmation process. 'We're talking about a devoted husband and father who was the top of his class at Yale and received accolades from the American Bar Association. And now his life has been destroyed by a completely non-credible individual bent on revenge. He has cast a cloud over this esteemed man and he should be deeply ashamed of the damage he has done to his family and the country as a whole.' Grassley added that he was confident the nomination of a morally upright man who had served his country for decades would not be derailed by the ravings of an inveterate liar like Kavanaugh. "
736,Trump Wakes Up Covered In Dozens Of Small Cuts After Being Chased Through Dreams By Razor-Blade-Fingered Robert Mueller,"WASHINGTON'Slowly coming to the realization that something was terribly wrong, President Trump reportedly awoke Friday to discover his entire body covered in dozens of small cuts after being chased through his dreams by a menacing Robert Mueller brandishing fingers covered in razor blades. 'Oh, thank God. It was just a dream,' said Trump, just before seeing the very real, tiny wounds on his arms and chest that mirrored the lacerations he had received as the psychotic special prosecutor pursued him down the halls of the White House within his nightmare, laughing maniacally while he slashed violently at the president. 'What'no. This isn't possible. It was a dream! It was just a dream!' Trump later discovered that he was still asleep the moment Robert Mueller's razor claws burst through the president's mattress, dragging his struggling body down into its seemingly endless depths."
737,Dick Durbin Wakes Up Chained To Radiator With Instructions To Saw Open Own Stomach To Access Kavanaugh Report,"WASHINGTON'Stirring from his chloroform-induced stupor to discover a handwritten note shoved inside his pocket, Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) reportedly awoke Thursday chained to a radiator with instructions to saw open his own stomach if he wished to access the FBI's report on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. 'You have 15 minutes to retrieve the document, read it, and get to the chamber to cast your vote,' said Durbin, who slowly became cognizant of the binder-shaped bulge pressing against the jagged stitches transecting his abdomen. 'The vote is Saturday. If you ever want to know what's inside that report, cut it out now. There will be no further instructions.' At press time, Durbin had gingerly drawn the rusty hacksaw provided by his captors across the first few inches of his distended gut before being interrupted by a groggy Senator Cory Booker emerging from a nearby bathtub."

'It's utterly ridiculous to think that I, of all people, would have the political acumen to take down Judge Kavanaugh,' said Clinton, who pointed to her squandering what amounted to a sure bet to be elected president in 2016 as proof that she was far too inept to perpetrate the kind of elaborate political hit job on Kavanaugh that others had accused her of. 'Come on, did you see the way I bungled all those allegations about my emails during the race? Or my totally pathetic efforts in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania? I haven't even been able to shed false accusations of murder from 25 years ago. If I had tried to derail his confirmation, the whole scheme would have backfired and he'd be sitting on the Supreme Court by now.' Clinton also scoffed at the notion that she would have any impulse to do anything about the Supreme Court pick other than play up his right-wing views while soliciting donations from her base."

Sources confirmed that as the plane carrying the first lady moved across the sky high above the grasslands, herds of wildebeests were spotted stampeding directly into each other, their hoofbeats drowned out by the deafening sound of snapping bones, while a nearby pair of giraffes was seen ripping apart a screeching hyena. According to reports, the severed hyena then attempted to drown itself by dragging the top half of its body to a watering hole, which was thick with the blood of a dozen hippopotamuses that appeared to be eagerly devouring their own entrails. After the aircraft disappeared over the horizon, the hysteria reportedly ended and the savanna quickly returned to normal, with vultures descending upon the thousands of carcasses that lay rotting in the first lady's wake."
744,Kavanaugh Starting To Get Worried About Not Hearing Back After Job Interview,"WASHINGTON'Frantically pacing around his home, pausing only to refresh his email inbox and check his phone's call log, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was starting to get worried Tuesday about not hearing back from his potential employers after his job interview. 'Oh man, oh man'it's almost been a week already and still nothing? It seemed like we established a great rapport. I mean, they must have been interested if they brought me back for a second interview, right? Hell, we even delved into some personal stuff from high school, so that's a good sign,' said Kavanaugh, who had, in a state of panic, reached out to his list of personal references to see if they had been contacted in regards to his candidacy. 'Shit, I really want this job. They didn't mention interviewing anyone else for the position, but maybe they were? I feel like I asked them some pretty decent questions, too. And I mentioned I went to Yale. Fuck, what if I forgot to bring that up?' At press time, Kavanaugh was nervously rewording a follow-up email so that he didn't come off as too desperate. "
745,White House Corrects Transcript To Add Few More Insults About Female Reporter,"WASHINGTON'Claiming that the current record failed to accurately represent the exchange that occurred during Monday's press conference, White House officials announced Tuesday their correction of the official transcript to add a few more insults about the involved female reporter. 'We've released a new transcript of the exchange between President Trump and ABC News's Cecilia Vega that precisely reflects how tired Ms. Vega looked, how ugly her dress was, and how whiny her voice sounded,' read the accompanying statement from the White House, explaining that the original record of the conversation omitted far too many misogynistic and disparaging remarks to be truly representative of the president's intentions. 'It's our duty to make sure that the official transcript reflects not only how little we think of Ms. Vega as a reporter, but also of the entire failing ABC fake-news operation as a whole. At the time of the exchange, President Trump was very frustrated and exhausted with how utterly pathetic the reporter's question was, so he unfortunately let slip fewer barbs about her physical appearance and intellectual capabilities than he would have otherwise.' At press time, the record had been corrected once more to deny the existence of any previous version of the transcript."
746,Chuck Grassley Scratches 'Christine Blasey's A Slut' Into Senate Bathroom Stall,"WASHINGTON'In an effort to undermine the credibility of the woman who testified that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her in high school, Senator Chuck Grassley reportedly scratched 'Christine Blasey's a slut' into a Senate bathroom stall Monday. Sources confirmed that Grassley, 85, an Iowa Republican who has served in the Senate since 1981, spent 20 minutes grinning to himself while using a key to etch the message into the paint on the stall door and saying, 'That'll show the lying tramp for dragging Brett through the mud.' Other writing adjacent to Grassley's message on the Capitol building stall reportedly included 'For a good time call Monica Lewinsky,' a crude drawing of a penis ejaculating onto a woman labeled 'Hillary Clinton,' as well as a nearly 30-year-old faded message in black Sharpie reading 'Anita Hill is a whore' that Grassley recognized as his own handwriting. At press time, Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ) had led FBI investigators into the bathroom to show them the message, saying it offered conclusive evidence that Dr. Blasey Ford's accusations were entirely baseless and that she clearly had no integrity whatsoever."

'Listen, Brett checks in with me every morning, and I know he wants to make things right, but he's vulnerable right now, and I'm afraid you're opening him up to a relapse if he doesn't get this gig on the Supreme Court,' said sponsor and recovering alcoholic John Palladino at a press conference, adding that losing this opportunity could send Kavanaugh into a spiral of negative and compulsive behavior not seen since his days at Yale. 'We need to support him in his sobriety, because you saw how hurt and how angry he got just talking about his drinking problem the other day, and I fear for what it could do to his poor family if he doesn't get this seat on the highest court in the land. Brett just got his 10-day chip and really needs our encouragement and help, and maybe a place to crash for a bit while he gets back on track.' At press time, Kavanaugh was using his 10-day chip to play quarters."
749,Lisa Murkowski Admits She Thought Being Alaskan Senator Would Just Mean Having To Deal With Bears And Shit,"WASHINGTON'Somewhat taken aback by her pivotal role in Brett Kavanaugh's potential confirmation to the Supreme Court, Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) confessed to reporters Friday that she initially believed being an Alaskan senator would mean nothing more complex than 'having to deal with bears and shit.' 'Oh, man, I tell you what, when I first signed up for this job, I was thinking I'd just be hashing out bald eagles and glaciers and tundras and stuff, not determining the judicial course that the entire damn country will be taking for decades to come,' said Murkowski, who assumed that upon taking office she would be mainly tasked with making sure moose don't wander onto the Great Alaskan Highway and signing people's fishing licenses, not serving as one of the key figures determining the ideological framework of an entire branch of government. 'Sure, I guessed there might be some more important stuff with, like, all those forests and natural resources and where to drill and such, but the last thing I thought I'd be asked to do was establish a symbolic precedent for how the nation deals with allegations of sexual assault by judges. Seriously, at most, I thought I'd have to have lunch with people doing stuff with the oil pipelines.' Susan Collins (R-ME) concurred with Murkowski, saying she once thought her job as the senator for Maine would mainly entail dealing with, like, lobsters and maple fucking syrup."

'Seriously, that's just fucking despicable, and there's no way that little bitch should be anywhere near the Supreme Court,' said a visibly pissed-off Judge, adding that he couldn't fathom handing over a lifetime appointment to America's highest judicial body to 'some candy-ass dipshit' who couldn't remember important things like the fact that everyone knows the Devil's Triangle 'is not some dumb drinking game'it's a fuckin' threesome with two dudes on one chick. It's awesome.' 'Jesus Christ, I've never been so disappointed in someone. I mean, I knew Brett was a puker, but I simply can't accept the possibility that he blacked out from drinking 'skis so many times that he forgot that boofing is taking beer up the ass. He said it's about farting? Come the fuck on, dude'we used to boof all the time! Man, all of America was watching, and he totally pussied out. Honestly, I'm ashamed to say I was his friend.' Judge added that he hoped that further investigations into Kavanaugh could allow the nominee to prove his truthfulness by vouching for the time they were in a threesome at a party and their dicks accidentally touched."

'I'm not asking for a crowd, but I wouldn't mind a few people stopping by to yell at me or hurl some sort of accusations just so I wouldn't have to eat by myself,' said Senator Graham, who also remarked on how 'lucky' Texas senator Ted Cruz had been to be chased from a restaurant over his support of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. 'I mean, I eat at least four meals a week in this Applebee's, and I'm a staunch Kavanaugh supporter who has said a lot of frankly terrible things to discredit his accusers, so why don't the regulars here try and drive me away? Hell, they don't even have to ruin my whole meal. Just a quick 'fuck you' as they walked by would make me feel like I was noticed.' Senator Graham later became defensive when a stranger walked toward him while saying, 'Hey, you,' but almost immediately realized the man had been addressing someone behind him."

'Man, I knew the Supreme Court doesn't let just anyone in, but I've got to say, they've really made me run the gauntlet and do all this embarrassing stuff'I mean, I had to go on national television with my wife and tell everyone how long I was a virgin,' said Kavanaugh, acknowledging that he had to respect the humiliating challenges he's been put through to prove himself worthy of the Supreme Court, like showing his high school diary to the entire country and having to face multiple women from his youth who he 'didn't even go all the way with.' 'I did some pretty gnarly stuff back during my fraternity days, so I figured they'd force me to get paddled or chant the Supreme Court motto 'Equal Justice Under Law' for a few hours outside in my underwear or stick my thumb up someone's ass, but this hazing is really putting me through a wringer. But I'll do whatever I have to if it means they'll let me be a justice. Supreme Court for life!' Kavanaugh added that when he had felt especially ashamed during the hazing process, he just reminded himself that this was the same initiation his future Supreme Court brother Clarence Thomas had to endure."
758,Kavanaugh Claims He Never Committed Sexual Assault As It Will Be Defined After Future Supreme Court Case,"WASHINGTON'Speaking before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Brett Kavanaugh defended himself against accusations of misconduct Thursday with claims that he never committed sexual assault as it will come to be defined in a future Supreme Court case. 'The allegations that I assaulted these women are categorically untrue based on the 2019 case of Sandberg v. Jones, which will establish that only penetrative sex can be classified as assault, and then only in cases with up to four eye-witnesses,' said Kavanaugh, arguing that the upcoming 5-4 decision in which he will write the majority opinion would completely exonerate him. 'Admittedly, there are things from my past that cause me to cringe, but I have never done anything that could be considered illegal based on this landmark ruling that will come up in the next few months. Furthermore, these accusations are largely irrelevant as they fall significantly outside the soon-to-be-established statute of limitations of two weeks following an alleged incident.' Kavanaugh added that this whole ordeal had been extremely trying for him and his family, and he looked forward to pursuing legal action against Christine Blasey Ford for violating forthcoming laws against defaming a federal judge."

We set up this hearing and sat there for hours waiting, yet we didn't hear a single word from her,' said Senator Chuck Grassley, who claimed the Senate now had no choice but to move forward on the confirmation vote since Ford had outright refused to publicly defend her allegations or even enter the Capitol Building. 'Her absence clearly discredits her entire story. Brett Kavanaugh was brave enough to show up, he spoke very clearly and eloquently, and everyone here carefully listened to what he had to say. My colleagues sacrificed their time and energy to prepare a number of important questions and waited around, but we just got crickets.' Grassley added that it was completely unprofessional for his Democratic colleagues Dianne Feinstein, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, and Mazie Hirono to skip the hearing as well."

762,Trump Regrets Choosing Kavanaugh After Supreme Court Nominee Keeps Talking About How Much He Respects Women,"WASHINGTON'Suddenly rethinking his selection amid an already tumultuous confirmation process, President Donald Trump told reporters Wednesday he regrets choosing Brett Kavanaugh after hearing the Supreme Court nominee talk extensively about the high regard in which he holds women. 'Whoa, hang on'when I nominated him, I thought it was pretty clear where he stood with the opposite sex, but now he's on TV going on and on about how all women are entitled to dignity and respect,' said the president, explaining that while he was on board with Kavanaugh's decision to deny all accusations of sexual assault, he began to have second thoughts after hearing his nominee describe a lifelong record of promoting equality for women. 'I'm thinking, Is this really the type of guy I want on the highest court in the land? I'd be fine if he were just going around talking about how much he values women who are beautiful, but he shouldn't be saying all this other stuff. What if it affects the way he rules? I should probably just withdraw the nomination before people start questioning my judgment.' At press time, sources reported President Trump had placed a frantic phone call to U.S. circuit judge Amy Barrett, saying her views on women could definitely be trusted."
763,Kavanaugh Sobering Up After 35-Year Bender Shocked To Find Out He's Supreme Court Nominee,"WASHINGTON'Growing increasingly confused as he slowly adjusted to his surroundings, Brett Kavanaugh was reportedly shocked Wednesday to find out he's a Supreme Court nominee after sobering up from a 35-year drunken bender. 'Oh, Christ, what the hell happened last night? What am I doing here?' said the yet-unconfirmed nominee, fighting waves of nausea and massaging his throbbing temples as he attempted to piece together not only how he safely made it home after completely blacking out, but also the series of events that resulted in him graduating from Yale, embarking on a career in law, getting married, buying a house, and starting a family. 'The last thing I remember was that I was about to nail that hot shooting guard from the women's basketball team, and then everything gets kind of hazy. Holy shit, wait'I worked for the Bush administration? I didn't even know there was a Bush presidency. And apparently Donald Trump is president now, whoever that is. I know I sometimes do crazy shit when I'm fucked up, but this is another level. Jesus'that's the last time I do shots of Jager.' At press time, Kavanaugh was reportedly attempting to quickly sober up by eating a 17-year-old slice of pizza he had found on the floor of his bedroom."
764,"The Investigation Ends Now,' Growls Shadow Counsel Holding Mueller By Throat At Top Of Washington Monument","WASHINGTON'After brutally launching the head of the special counsel investigation into Russian election interference through every marble pillar of the Jefferson Memorial, the nefarious shadow special counsel held Robert Mueller by the throat at the top of the Washington monument Wednesday and hissed that 'Your investigation ends now.' 'You've followed your little trail long enough, you paltry, pathetic patriot,' said dark Mueller, his viselike grip tightening on the neck of the attorney and former FBI director as he inexorably forced the special counsel's face down toward the monument's razor-sharp electrum-plated pyramidal tip. 'Your time is up! The president will be exonerated! Any final questions?' Eyewitnesses fleeing the scene reported having no idea as to how the conflict ended, as their view was obstructed when Mueller countered the shadow counsel's onslaught by launching both himself and his foul doppelganger off the top of the monument, causing them to plummet the full 554 feet to the bottom of the reflecting pool, which emptied itself thunderously as all its water leapt skyward in the cataclysmic shock wave."
765,Kavanaugh Says It's Super Embarrassing And Sad That Christine Blasey Ford Still In Love With Him,"WASHINGTON'Saying the continued attention from his former flame was beginning to border on obsession, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh told reporters Tuesday it's super embarrassing and sad that Christine Blasey Ford is still in love with him. 'It's just so awkward that she keeps holding a candle for me even though it's been, like, 35 years now,' said Kavanaugh, explaining that while he and Ford may have shared a romantic moment as teenagers, it's 'kind of pathetic' that she continues to dwell on it. 'In a way, I'm flattered, I really am, but at this point it's starting to get a little creepy. I hear she's even telling her therapist about me. Apparently, some people just never move on from high school. It's like, come on, Christine'it's not going to happen, okay? Sorry.' Later, the visibly distressed nominee expressed his hope that there weren't too many other loves from his past out there who have yet to get over him. "
766,Everyone At U.N. Watching Trump Speak Can't Believe They Used To Consider U.S. A Superpower,"NEW YORK'Shaking their heads in disbelief at their past views, everyone present at the United Nations summit watching President Donald Trump deliver a speech Tuesday reportedly couldn't believe they used to consider the United States a superpower. 'I mean, wow, we would base most of our decisions on what the U.S. was going to do'seriously, what the hell were we thinking?' said Prime Minister of Portugal Antnio Costa, echoing the sentiments of dozens of other world leaders attending the General Assembly session who wondered how they had ever convinced themselves that they should care what America thinks. 'We really used to see the U.S. as one of, if not the dominant force in the world, but that seems like forever ago. There are probably 20 or 30 countries whose plans I'd pay attention to before I even thought to consider how America would react. Seriously, imagine being concerned over how your diplomatic relations with Donald Trump are going'it feels totally beside the point, right? Although, jeez, if I'm being honest, maybe ever considering America to be a global superpower in the first place was misguided.' At press time, Trump casually threatening to unilaterally bomb multiple other countries with little justification reminded everyone at the U.N. that this was the reason everyone had to take America seriously."

770,"Over 417,000 Hours Of Private Presidential Conversations Discovered After No One Remembered To Turn Off Richard Nixon's Tape Recorder","WASHINGTON'Baffled as to how the potentially disastrous mistake could have gone unnoticed for so many years, White House sources confirmed Friday that roughly 417,225 hours of private presidential conversations were discovered immaculately preserved due to the fact that no one remembered to turn off Richard Nixon's tape recorder. 'Uh oh'it turns out that every single word that has been uttered in the Oval Office since the early 1970s has been perfectly recorded on this hidden device. This could be pretty bad,' said a Trump administration official who wished to remain anonymous, revealing that aides had stumbled upon the tapes earlier this week and, after discovering they contained thousands of clearly recorded conversations over the course of the Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush, Obama, and Trump presidencies, had been unsure how to proceed in handling a find of such magnitude. 'I'm not sure the American public could handle some of the information these tapes contain. There's key information that could clarify the Iran'Contra scandal, countless conversations about the war in Iraq'there's even a meeting where George W. Bush and Dick Cheney discuss 9/11 almost a month before it happened. This is going to have huge repercussions.' At press time, sources reported that the panicked aides had, in a botched attempt to delete the recording, accidentally begun to play on a loop the audio of a 1981 Oval Office meeting in which Vice President George H.W. Bush hires John Hinckley Jr. to assassinate president Ronald Reagan."
771,,"WASHINGTON'Questioning the actions taken by Christine Blasey Ford in the 1980s following the alleged sexual abuse by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh while they were in high school, President Donald Trump reportedly asked Friday why she didn't just immediately request hush money. 'If this thing actually happened, why didn't she come forward 30 years ago with a demand for secret payments to keep quiet?' said Trump, adding that a decades-old allegation of sexual abuse that wasn't instantly followed by her threatening to go public unless Kavanaugh and his family paid her off totally lacked credibility. 'If the attack on Dr. Ford was as bad as she says, surely she has a copy of the demands she sent to Brett Kavanaugh or bank documents showing the transfer of a six-figure sum into her account during the '80s that she could show us. It's baffling'if he really did something illegal, why didn't she just demand money for her role in covering up the crime? That's what any normal person would do.' The president acknowledged that he could see how someone might have difficulty remembering the exact details of their involvement in a six-figure hush money payment made back in the 1980s."
772,Congress Wishes They Could Help Puerto Rico But It's All The Way Over There,"WASHINGTON'Emphasizing that they really want to help any way they can, members of Congress announced Friday that while they desperately wish they could lend aid and assistance to the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico while it struggles to recover from Hurricane Maria, the fact remains that the island is all the way over there. 'It should go without saying that our hearts go out to the residents of Puerto Rico in this hour of need, and we want nothing more than to help its citizens, but they live way, way off in the sticks,' said Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-WI), stressing that Puerto Rico is not connected to the mainland by either bridges or tunnels, and when you look at a map you can plainly see it is all the way out in the Caribbean. 'Let's be clear'we all feel that it would be fantastic to provide these people post-disaster assistance, but have you ever been to that part of the world? It's pretty much halfway around the globe. Any doctors, engineers, or infrastructure technicians we sent would be, like, 'Ugh, how long does it take to go the whole way to Puerto Rico?' after just a few hours, trust me.' Congress has also released a non-binding resolution officially declaring that by the time any U.S. aid reached Puerto Rican residents, they probably would have the hurricane damage all fixed anyway."
773,"GOP Officials Urge Calmer, More Reasonable Death Threats Toward Kavanaugh Accuser","WASHINGTON'Urging a return to civility amid a contentious confirmation fight, GOP officials called Thursday for calmer, more reasonable death threats to be made toward Judge Brett Kavanaugh's accuser. 'We understand there's a lot of controversy around this, but she still deserves to have people threaten to kill her in a polite way,' said Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA), who added that cooler heads must prevail, especially when dealing with a situation as delicate as taunting the accuser by vowing to broadcast her family's home address. 'It's important for us to maintain a sense of decorum. Now, that doesn't mean we have to stop sending graphic emails'it just means we should tone down the rhetoric about mutilating her corpse. You should always take the high road and leave her children out of this. Remember, there's really no need to use misogynistic slurs such as 'bitch' when 'lying whore' will suffice.' At press time, Grassley reiterated that a 'true conservative' would terrorize her in a way that would 'make our founding fathers proud.'"

'We're talking about something that occurred when Mr. Kavanaugh was a mere 17-year-old Caucasian,' said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), adding that it was ridiculous to allow a single incident that happened when Kavanaugh was in an elite and mostly white high school ruin the career of such an accomplished white person. 'I expect most of my colleagues here in the Senate remember what it's like to be a young white man and make mistakes. The important thing is that we learn from those mistakes and grow up to be responsible white adults. It's shameful that my Democratic colleagues feel the need to sully Judge Kavanaugh's reputation when they, too, surely understand that boys of European descent will be boys of European descent.' McConnell went on to state that the assault would hardly even be noteworthy had the victim not been a 15-year-old white girl."
778,Ink-Splattered Trump Boys Counter Media Bias By Hand-Printing Own Newspaper In White House Basement,"WASHINGTON'While using brightly colored magic markers to write articles in a makeshift bullpen deep beneath the White House, an ink-splattered Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. said Wednesday they had made it their mission to fight bias in the mainstream media by hand-printing their own newspaper. According to the brothers, the inaugural issue of their paper, called The Trump Boy Times, covers the most pressing issues of the day, with front-page stories such as 'The Time Dad Saved The Country In Porko Reeco From A Hurricane' and 'Dad Again Tops List Of 100 Best American Pretzeldents.' Though fingerprints and smudges rendered much of the text unreadable, the content inside the paper appeared to include obituaries of 'dumb Democrats' the boys wished were dead and a comic strip depicting the misadventures of a character called Little Eric. 'When we heard the stuff those mean news jerks were talking about, we knew we had to find a way to get a whole bunch of the actual truth out there,' said Eric Trump, who held up a copy of the issue to show how hard he had worked to decorate its construction-paper pages with stickers and glitter, continuing on with the project even after a misapplication of rubber cement resulted in his hand being stuck to a table for more than an hour. 'Unlike those lying germalists [sic], when we make up the news, we don't use any bias. We are doing lotsa good work.' 'After all, President Dad is counting on us!' Eric added. Reports within the executive residence confirmed the Trump boys were going through two packs of candy cigarettes a day as they sat in an unused closet illuminated only by their Vtech Spin and Learn Color Flashlight, transcribing notes they had written on their hands during a 'top-secret meeting' with Ben Carson. White House sources confirmed the brothers cornered the Housing and Urban Development secretary in the West Wing and peppered Carson with questions about how much bigger and louder America's bombs were than North Korea's. With the first issue's publication fast approaching, sources said production had come to a screeching halt early Tuesday, when Don Jr. yelled, 'Stop the presses!' after Eric hit him on the arm for saying the younger brother wasn't old enough to be the newspaper's editor. The boys then reportedly began wrestling as they argued over whether to lead the edition with the story about their dad being the number-one president of all time or an exclusive headlined 'No Moore Choccccolate Milk In White Howse Cafurteria.' The tense editorial meeting reportedly came to an abrupt conclusion once Eric started crying after being placed into a headlock. Later, while touting The Trump Boy Times as 'the only place to get the real story that probably happened,' Don Jr. and Eric were seen distributing the half dozen handmade copies they had finally produced to the first people they encountered in the halls of the White House, including a Secret Service agent, two West Wing interns, Melania Trump, and a butler who brought them a snack after they complained about running out of graham crackers. Deeming their project a success, the brothers were soon overheard planning the launch of a Trump Boys TV news channel, and after climbing inside a large cardboard box with a hole cut out of the front, they spent much of the afternoon interviewing their favorite action figures and asking them why people spread so many lies about their dad. 'Now that we're on the beat, there will finally be a paper that runs real news about Dad,' Don Jr. said while taking a break from penning a statement from the newspaper's editorial board urging the president to let his sons stay up until 8:30 p.m. and eat ice cream. 'It's been super tough trying to get the story. Sometimes you have to camp out underneath the Resolute desk for a whole hour, and sometimes Eric has to keep going to the press briefings every day even though Sarah Sanders never calls on him. But no matter what, we always get the scoop.' 'I bet we'll get a Publisher's Surprise [sic] for this,' he added. At press time, sources reported President Trump was throwing a wadded-up newspaper at the boys and telling them to get out of his office."

Ted Cruz (R-TX) reportedly tried to connect with the audience at a candidate forum Tuesday by wearing the bloody, skinned face of a far more handsome man as a mask. 'People are really responding to this new, dapper Ted Cruz,' said campaign manager Jeff Roe, noting that recent internal polls show that since Cruz adopted the new look, voters are twice as likely to describe the expressionless, gore-covered incumbent as 'trustworthy,' 'affable,' or 'charming.' 'That rough-cut mask of rotting skin is doing wonders for the senator on the campaign trail. He's honestly never looked better, and the voters are really beginning to take notice. Even with the stench of decomposition, most people we talk to remark upon how Sen. Cruz doesn't make them feel as nauseous as he used to. He's looking a lot healthier, too.' Roe later confirmed that while Cruz's current mask was rapidly decaying, the candidate had a freezer filled with enough handsome and blood-encrusted masks of human skin to last him through the campaign's final stretch."

'We feel strongly that 15 million people fleeing abuses in their own countries can be accommodated by our great nation's fiery, spike-covered compactor,' said Trump, noting that this number represented the highest cap on asylum seekers since the hydraulically powered displaced-person-reducer was first created in 1980. 'We are proud to welcome those without a home into our state-of-the-art refugee pulverizer where they will be greeted by rows and rows of razor-sharp spears lacerating their flesh as the walls slowly close in around them before ultimately being reduced to ashes by 450-degree flames. Every refugee, no matter their circumstances, deserves the chance to be admitted into this harrowing gauntlet of torture and death.' Trump added that emigrants from countries impacted by the travel ban would still be forced to return to their respective home countries' citizen crushers."

'Thanks to President Trump's incredible hurricane response team, the population of North and South Carolina is actually skyrocketing, with over a dozen people being born, spontaneously generating, or being resurrected,' said White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, adding that despite 90-mph winds and 7-foot flood zones, FEMA and the National Guard had found several newborns, clones, and reincarnated individuals nearly every hour on the hour. 'Not only have zero American citizens died during this record-breaking storm, but over the past few days alone, workers have also located a number of missing people, including many Puerto Ricans who were declared missing or dead during Hurricane Maria. As the storm continues to move up the coast, we can only pray that many, many more Americans are created in the wreckage.'

I was so confident I cashed in my 401(k), borrowed $65,000 on top of my mortgage, and shoved my daughters' college funds in the pot. I can't have it go south now,' said Kavanaugh while texting his bookie on his burner phone, insisting that the Senate vote would go exactly to plan and that caving in his kneecaps wouldn't be necessary. 'If I don't get a few more days to make sure these Republican senators don't flip, Vito's going to feed me to the pigs. That guy does not fuck around.'

'Given the significance of this vote and the accusations at hand, it's of the utmost importance that we give ourselves the time to carefully drag Miss Ford's name through the mud and make her regret ever coming forth with these accounts,' said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), stressing that he would urge his colleagues to push back any vote on the nomination until the Senate Judiciary Committee had taken every opportunity to tear apart Ford's character on a national stage, question her mental stability, and repeatedly trivialize her experience of sexual trauma. 'We can't in good conscience confirm Judge Kavanaugh'to the highest court in the land, mind you'without making a serious attempt to find evidence from the accuser's life suggesting she's nothing more than a serial liar and attention seeker. If not just to slander her name, than at least to invalidate the experiences of every sexual assault victim in the country.' McConnell stressed that he understood the need for swiftness in the matter, as the Senate would absolutely confirm Kavanaugh regardless of any findings."
786,Koch Brothers Furious Kavanaugh Never Disclosed That Nation Might Care About Sexual Abuse,"WICHITA, KS'Expressing their displeasure that the Supreme Court nominee had failed to warn them about a factor that could harm his candidacy, the Koch brothers were reportedly furious Monday that Brett Kavanaugh never disclosed that the nation might care about sexual abuse. 'When we agreed to spend millions of dollars toward his confirmation, we never believed Kavanaugh would've withheld important information from us like the fact that being a sexual predator could someday have consequences,' said an angry Charles Koch, adding that his advocacy group, Americans for Prosperity, would not have committed money to supporting Kavanaugh if he had come clean about the recent shift in America's societal conscience that held some men credibly accused of sexual misconduct accountable for their actions. 'Look, we've been building up Kavanaugh's resume and qualifications for decades, and not once did he make any sort of suggestion that committing a nonconsensual sexual act on another person could be a problem in the United States. We would have never put him on our shortlist for the nation's highest court if we knew the American people would ever pay attention to this or that it could have any adverse effect.' The Koch brothers added that they were already putting a more strenuous vetting process into place, stating that they were now asking candidates if the nation would ever care about racism."

'He told me that I was the chosen one and I'm the one true president, but also it was the wrong guy speaking on God's behalf. I'm not a huge supporter of Islam, but on the other hand, I really liked what Muhammad was saying. Hmm, this is a toughie,' said the vice president, attempting to weigh his desire for political power against his strict commitment to Evangelical Christianity, which were seemingly unable to coexist in the vision of the future brought forth by the sacred prophet and founder of Islam. 'Maybe it was just Jesus disguised as the prophet Muhammad and he was trying to test my faith. But then, does that mean it's not my fate to be president? I guess I could convert to Islam for a few days just to claim my destiny and then convert right back to Christianity. I mean, Islam and Christianity are actually kind of similar when you think about it, right?' At press time, Pence had decided to split the difference between the two religions and converted to Judaism."

The Onion presents the case for and against confirming Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court. Will interpret the law using framers' original intent of unlimited executive power. Made it through entire hearing without perjuring himself more than a couple times. Would deal significant blow to Cory Booker's 2020 presidential chances. Told Senator Harris he didn't discuss the Mueller investigation with anyone, so it's nice he's not a gossip. Served as White House staff secretary under Resistance hero George W. Bush. Would give next several decades of activists lots to work with. Last thing we need is another dirty Catholic on the bench. The country's complicated labyrinth women must navigate to get an abortion is fine just the way it is. Attended Yale. Favorite Supreme Court case is the hacky, cliched Biddle v. Perovich. Would offer fun challenge to conservative donors to find someone even worse. Staunch version of originalism doesn't take into consideration that those things happened 250 years ago and most people were really fucking stupid back then."

'While Trump is right that economic inequality is increasing under him, he cannot ignore the Obama administration's significant contributions to the current wealth gap,' said Brookings Institution senior analyst Gregory Chen, adding that any overview of rising economic inequality must also consider other factors deserving credit, such as banks, technology companies, and other corporations that routinely broke laws and engaged in predatory practices, over which any president has little control. 'President Trump needs to face the fact that he is simply not solely responsible for the further enrichment of corporate executives and for making millions of Americans' lives more financially precarious'President Obama made great strides in those areas over his eight years as president. Credit where credit is due. However, if Trump's massive tax reforms continue transferring money to the ultra-wealthy, we could certainly see a time in the future where Trump's contributions to economic inequality override Obama's legacy and truly help American households in the top 1 percent.' At press time, critics also slammed Trump for taking credit for many of the part-time jobs with no benefits and zero job security added to the U.S. economy for which Obama is actually responsible."

'Everyone is super mad about this secret bad guy in the White House, but we put a whole candy bar and a bunch of real money in there, and we're gonna catch the crook,' said Donald Trump Jr., who, along with his younger brother, was crouched behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office to monitor their trap and pull the rope once the 'buttless [sic]' opinion-piece writer climbed under the plastic tub to grab the candy. 'I've got a Super Soaker and Eric has a broom so we can arrest him once he gets stuck. We also dug a pretty deep hole in the backyard and covered it with a blanket and some pieces of grass on top. It has our Iron Man action figure and some Skittles and some of Dad's Pop Secret [sic] work stuff on it to trick him to walk over and then fall down and never, ever get out unless we say so.

'We're experiencing a crisis in our democracy that can only be stopped by showing up to vote for people who will fight for transformative change, but until we start offering that, please just go to your polling place and cast your vote for whichever mediocre Democrat is on the ballot,' said Obama, pressing young people to avoid thinking about the actual track records and ideological beliefs of Democratic Party politicians who have been in government for years and just concentrating on the (D) next to their name. 'We have too many eligible voters who are staying home on Election Day instead of standing up to the Republican Party by voting for Democrats who are in many respects exactly like their Republican opponents. Less than one in five young Americans voted in the 2014 midterms because our party ran very few good candidates, and we implore you to go out and vote this time even though we're doing that again. What's important for the future of America is that you just close your eyes, don't think about it too hard, and select that name.' At press time, Obama urged the young generation of voters to stand up and save the U.S. democracy, since his generation of Democratic politicians was not capable of such a feat."

'Honestly, I'm kind of shocked that these senators didn't rake me over the coals for not having a law degree,' said Kavanaugh, noting that while he took a few political science classes in college and read SCOTUSBlog from time to time, he was really more of a legal hobbyist. 'I'm happy to share my opinion on abortion and stuff, but, again, that isn't grounded in any kind of legal background, per se. In fact, I actually majored in sports medicine.' Kavanaugh went on to note that despite not knowing exactly how the Supreme Court functioned, he was sure he would pick up on most of the U.S. judicial system's quirks after a few weeks on the job."

'Oh, man, I can't believe I fucked this up and sided with the Prince of Darkness'I was doing so well up until then!

797,John Kelly Relieved Trump So Fucking Stupid He'll Believe Woodward Made Up Disparaging Quotes,"WASHINGTON'Expressing his gratitude that the president was a big enough dipshit to be this easily placated, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly was reportedly relieved Wednesday that Donald Trump was so fucking stupid that he believed Bob Woodward had fabricated disparaging quotes from staffers in his upcoming book, Fear. 'I was sweating bullets for a minute there when the president called me into his office for referring to him as 'unhinged' and 'an idiot,' but luckily when I told him Woodward invented the whole thing, that dumbass fell for it hook, line, and sinker,' said the retired Marine Corps general, explaining how easily he convinced Trump that the Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist was lying by just saying 'fake news' a couple times and assuring the president that he was an incredible leader. 'I thought I might run into some trouble because this is the same excuse I used in April when NBC quoted me calling him an idiot, but nope, he lapped it all up again no problem. I guess I forgot for a second what a drooling, slack-jawed moron the president is. Honestly, even if I had owned up to it, old shit-for-brains probably would have forgotten what I said 15 minutes later.' Kelly added that now that this controversy had been laid to rest, he could focus on steadfastly serving the unconscionable dumbfuck for the remainder of his term."
798,Kavanaugh Packing Gun At Congressional Hearing In Case Parkland Father Tries To Shake His Hand Again,"WASHINGTON'Fearing for his safety after an incident with Fred Guttenberg the previous day, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was reportedly packing a gun at his Senate hearing Wednesday in case the father of a Parkland shooting victim tried to shake his hand again. 'If that son-of-a-bitch comes up and threatens to greet me one more time, he's got another thing coming,' said a jumpy Kavanaugh, who concealed a semi-automatic pistol in his belt to protect himself against the gun control activist as he appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee, reaching toward the firearm several times believing he saw Guttenberg approaching to introduce himself out of the corner of his vision. 'I'm not going to sit here unable to defend myself against people trying to meet me'I know my Second Amendment rights. This is my confirmation hearing, and if that bastard comes at me again, I'm going to blow off his damn hand.' At press time, a frightened Kavanaugh had grabbed his gun to stand his ground against a threatening black man and shot Senator Cory Booker."
799,Trump Disapproval Rating Reaches All-Time None Of This Matters,"WASHINGTON'Offering an overview of Americans' opinions of the commander in chief's job performance, a new poll released Friday indicated that President Trump's disapproval rating had reached an all-time none of this matters. The report, released by who really cares which of the utterly useless polling firms and corroborated by several leading increasingly feckless news organizations, confirmed that well over half of those surveyed for really no goddamn reason. In addition, the poll found strong support for who gives a shit, it's just a bunch of fucking numbers. Sources explained that the change in the polls was in response to something the president did or said that is similar to things he has done or said for years, and that the disapproval rating would change on a whim soon just like it does with every president because those surveyed will have gotten mad about something else or forgotten about it or are just unable to contextualize current events within any sort of historical or societal framework, so simply gathering and staring at a bunch of different statistics doesn't mean jack shit. At press time, a new poll had found that President Trump's disapproval rating was now at, Jesus Christ, a sizable portion of the country supports and has always supported an openly white supremacist president and the party he leads, and a bunch of goddamn numerical ratings aren't going to do a fucking thing to change that."

'Many of my critics on the left fail to understand that my words were simply meant to fly under the radar and reach an intended audience without repercussions,' said DeSantis, lamenting that his code words caused a media firestorm when his only objective was to target a specific bigoted group that agreed with the message. 'This whole media outcry is, frankly, overblown. People are acting like I threw out an actual racial slur when what I actually said was a harmless piece of rhetoric that's been used to dehumanize black people for centuries. If anything, folks should be upset that 'monkey this up' isn't a real idiom.' DeSantis concluded his press conference by issuing an apology to 'Mayor Gillum and his family' followed by a sly wink."
802,Ryan Zinke Calls For Legislation To Slow Down Destruction Of Wildlife So He Can Truly Savor Every Minute Of It,"WASHINGTON'Declaring the rapid decrease in the population of several endangered species 'problematic,' Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke called for new legislation Thursday designed to slow the destruction of the nation's wildlife so that he might relish every last minute of its extinction. 'We need to preserve these magnificent animals so that I can watch them suffer one by one,' said Zinke, adding that the more species were preserved, the more opportunities he would have to look on as they starved, choked on garbage, or became caught in bear traps. 'Animals, plants, and insects are currently dying out at the rate of 200 per day, and it's just not humanly possible to savor the death throes of the last of something's kind if they're all happening at once. We need to pump the brakes and make an effort to preserve, oh, let's say, the last thousand Hawaiian harbor seals so that someday my grandchildren can experience the wonder of watching as the life drains from their adorable little eyes.' Zinke concluded by introducing a fundraising measure designed to draw out the suffering of the nation's most iconic endangered bird by selling T-shirts and bumper stickers emblazoned with the legend 'SAVE THE CALIFORNIA CONDOR FOR LAST.'"
803,Trump Revokes Puerto Rico Recovery Funds After Learning Hurricane Maria Had Fewer Survivors,"WASHINGTON'Following the release of official reports that attributed 2,975 deaths to the 2017 storm instead of the previous estimate of 64, President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he was revoking a significant amount of funding devoted to Puerto Rico after learning that Hurricane Maria had way fewer survivors. 'The new data shows that there are substantially less people than we thought who are still alive, which means they don't need as much money to help each of them recover,' said Trump, adding that he was slashing the $18.5 billion earmarked for the island's recovery by the Department of Housing and Urban Development by at least $12 billion to $15 billion since 'now they don't need as much food and houses and stuff.' 'We want to help the people of Puerto Rico recover from this massive, massive storm, but it's too late to help people recover if they're already dead. And, look, I'm not saying the people of Puerto Rico were lying to get more money, but it's pretty suspicious that they waited until now to tell us how many more people died. At least finding out about the hurricane death toll now means a lot of American money will be saved.' Trump added that the people of Puerto Rico should be pleased about the reduced recovery funding, since there would be less U.S. money wasted there the next time a massive hurricane hits."

'Sadly, RedTube displays a consistent left-leaning bias, whether through its temporary ban of outspoken Republican porn star Cindy Lixxx's popular 'Spread Bald Eagle' channel or its hiding of search results for phrases such as 'Stars and Stripes double penetration,'' said Rep. Steve King (R-IA), who echoed dozens of GOP lawmakers as he argued that such actions not only suppress important voices, but also discriminate against conservative viewers who simply want to see bondage scenes of right-wing cam girls blindfolded and bound with the American flag. 'RedTube operates a widely used public forum for the exchange of hardcore materials, and it should not be allowed to determine whether Americans are permitted to watch rock-hard Republicans cuming on the tits of fiscally conservative adult film stars. Otherwise, before you know it, the only pornographic videos online will be liberal bukkake or'I shudder to even say it'socialist gang bangs.' In response, a RedTube spokesperson cited the company's history of providing a neutral platform and pointed to its long-running offerings favored by establishment Republicans, including the premium pornography channel, 'Bush.'"
806,New Ted Cruz Campaign Ad Features His Kids Begging For Beto O'Rourke To Be Their New Dad,"HOUSTON'With scenes in which the two little girls can be seen pleading with outstretched arms, a new Ted Cruz campaign ad released Tuesday features the incumbent U.S. senator's children begging for challenger Beto O'Rourke to be their new dad. 'Mr. O'Rourke, could you be our new daddy'please, please, please, with a cherry on top?' Cruz's 10-year-old daughter Caroline said in the 30-second spot, promising that she and her sister will get straight As and be on their best behavior if the current U.S. representative from El Paso would take over all fathering duties immediately and let them come live with his family. 'You'd be a nice, normal daddy, not weird and creepy like the one we have now. We could even introduce you to our friends without being embarrassed. We love you, Beto!' The campaign advertisement concludes with a tearful Heidi Cruz begging on bended knee for O'Rourke to be her new husband."
807,White House Flag Now Moving Minute To Minute To Indicate Trump's Mood,"WASHINGTON'Controversy surrounding whether the commander in chief was properly honoring recently deceased Senator John McCain increased Tuesday after reports indicated that the White House flag was now being moved up or down on its staff minute to minute to indicate President Donald Trump's current mood. 'It's no secret that the president and the late senator had a contentious relationship, and President Trump wants the flag's position to be perfectly calibrated to his current sentiments about Mr. McCain so the nation knows exactly how he feels,' said White House deputy chief of staff of operations Daniel Walsh as facilities employees raced to raise the flag precisely 26 inches above half-staff to reflect a surge of anger Trump had just experienced toward McCain receiving so much public adulation. 'Obviously, we lowered the flag to half-staff on Monday after the president plunged into an extended bad mood due to the backlash over raising it to full staff on Sunday, but then we had to lower the flag another fifth of the way down the flagpole early this morning when Mr. Trump woke up and felt even worse about it. Then, at 9:41 a.m., we had to raise it 59 percent up the staff because Mr. Trump was feeling somewhat contrite about not honoring Mr. McCain, but not as bad as before, only to raise it to 86 percent of the way up at 9:49 a.m. because the president decided he didn't care that much about the senator anymore. For the last couple hours, we've been raising and lowering the flag from anywhere to just one quarter of the way up the flagpole to 96 percent of the way up, depending on how mad, sad, guilty, jealous, apologetic, fearful, or annoyed Mr. Trump is feeling about the senator at any given moment. We also had to rush to take it down entirely from 10:47-10:54 a.m. when Mr. Trump just got bored of the whole thing. We've definitely been scrambling'wait, I'm just receiving word now that we've got to lower it another 2.6 inches because the president is excited about pissing off liberals but he's also sleepy and hungry.' Walsh added that although it was tiring for his staff to keep raising and lowering the flag, they would keep doing it, because the position of the White House flag is of the absolute utmost national importance."
808,White House Releases Moving Statement Honoring Woman Who Called Obama An Arab In 2008,"WASHINGTON'In a timely tribute to a woman they are calling a fearless American hero, the White House released a statement Monday recognizing and honoring the woman who called then-presidential candidate Barack Obama an Arab during a town hall event in 2008. 'It is with great reverence that we celebrate the courage, life, and work of the woman who told John McCain at a 2008 campaign rally that she couldn't trust Barack Obama because he was an Arab,' the statement read in part. 'Despite the fact that it would have been far easier for her to hold her tongue and remain silent, she bravely stood up for her country and called Obama out for being a foreigner, and in doing so, she truly earned the title of 'maverick.' A ruthless defender of patriotism who refused to cower during her shining moment on the national stage, she courageously focused national attention on Obama's Muslim pedigree. From the bottom of our hearts, we thank you for your service, ma'am.' The statement concluded by saying that her brave and inspiring comments would live on in this country for generations to come."

'Congressman Hunter's actions simply do not line up with the Republican party's core principles with regards to the possession of personal wealth. The simple fact that the representative does not have enough money to pay for third or even second homes, private schooling for his children, or basic cosmetic health care, constitutes a betrayal of everything the party stands for,' the statement read in part. 'This gross lack of personal finances does not represent the Grand Old Party writ large. That Duncan Hunter held actual middle-class status for years, instead of merely pretending to share middle-class values, is absolutely reprehensible behavior unbefitting a Republican congressman.' Beltway insiders expect Hunter to resign his office and relinquish his House seat to an astoundingly wealthy party member as soon as possible."

'My God, what have we done?' said California representative Devin Nunes as the merciless identical counterpart to the special counsel, who was created from DNA covertly harvested from Robert Mueller in order to halt the former FBI director's progress on the Russia probe, exploded from the straps binding him in the incubation chamber, sloughed off the birthing gel, lurched forward, snapped Rand Paul's neck, and quickly put on the Kentucky senator's suit. 'Look upon him'why, he is both man and beast. The world shall never be the same thanks to this abomination.' At press time, the shadow counsel jumped out of a nearby window and began heading to the D.C. Appellate Court in order to file a writ to have Paul Manafort's conviction reversed, citing wrongful admission of evidence."

Hatch Says Trump Allegations Not Serious Enough That Scales Should Fall From Eyes Revealing What Madness We Have Begotten,"WASHINGTON'In the wake of Paul Manafort's conviction and Michael Cohen's guilty plea, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) told reporters Thursday that the mounting allegations against President Trump are not yet serious enough to make the scales fall from the eyes of Republicans and allow them to behold the sheer shrieking madness they have begotten. 'Simply put, there is at present insufficient evidence against the Trump administration to justify the tearing of blindfolds from Republican eyes at this point, and therefore, we remain safe from gazing in horror at the maelstrom of sheer insanity that we ourselves have loosed upon the world,' said Hatch, claiming it would be woefully premature for Congress to commit themselves to any course of action in which they might glimpse the unveiled face of the ravening madness vomited into existence by them and them alone. 'Perhaps six months from now, as even more damning details of the president's action are divulged, we can more confidently open our eyes to the corrosive reality we unleashed when we damned ourselves by giving birth to this repellent idiot abomination, suckling it on the putrescence of our own squalid ambition, weaning it with pain and hatred in our foul nest of all-consuming mania to slaver forever in the fetid darkness, untouched by mercy or hope. But until then, the GOP will take the wait-and-see approach.' At press time, Hatch declined to support measures to ensure the preservation of the republic should Congress stare into the abyss of their own blasphemous hypocrisy and, in so doing, be consumed by it."

'Okay, Eric, I think we melted down all the stuff we wrote from last year so now Mr. Mueller can't never find it'time to start wrecking all the emails from this year,' said Trump Jr., who, along with his brother, had stayed up all night printing out every single email ever sent or received by either of the boys and setting the stacks of paper ablaze in a plastic garbage can to eliminate any evidence that could be used against them in an investigation. 'We gotta type up copies of our texts so we can print them out and burn those, too'you can't be too careful with the witch hunt. And once we finish burning all the evidence, we have to take pictures of our faces on Instagram and then print out those, too, and burn them so we can delete our identities. Then we have to leave and never come back, okay? We have to go to one of the small dots on a map where they can't find us.' At press time, the Trump boys were attempting to erase any trace of their deliberate destruction of evidence by using masking tape to secure rocks to the top of the printer and pushing the device into the depths of the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool where it would 'never, ever be found.'"
817,GOP Quick To Point Out That Michael Cohen Was Merely RNC's Deputy Finance Chairman,"WASHINGTON'Explaining the position was essentially a minor role, the GOP quickly pointed out Wednesday that Michael Cohen was merely the Republican National Committee's deputy finance chairman. 'Look, at the end of the day, all Michael Cohen did was help oversee the finances for one of the two major American political parties in a leading capacity,' said RNC chair Ronna Romney McDaniel, adding that the president's lawyer, who was under investigation for $20 million in bank fraud, was only the second most powerful person when it came to determining the nationwide organization's budget and long-term financial goals. 'Seriously, he wasn't in charge of all of the money; there were at least two or three people above him. People are acting like Cohen was this super important figure, but when you look at it, he just worked in a top position for a political group representing over 60 million Americans.' The GOP was also quick to point out that Paul Manafort, who was found guilty of eight counts of financial crimes, only served as the campaign manager for the current United States president, performing minor tasks such as handpicking Mike Pence as Donald Trump's running mate."
818,Mueller Immediately Regrets Coercing Michael Cohen To Flip On Trump After Having To Spend Time With Him,"WASHINGTON'Admitting that it was probably the worst mistake he has made since starting the investigation, Special Counsel Robert Mueller told reporters Wednesday that he immediately regretted coercing Michael Cohen to flip on the president after having to spend time with him. 'At first, I thought that getting Cohen to cooperate would be great for the case, but Jesus, I can't handle dealing with this fucking idiot,' said a visibly irritated Mueller, explaining that gaining valuable evidence on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election straight from a source deep within Trump's inner circle just wasn't worth hearing the 'smug, insufferable moron blathering on and on.' 'We're only a quarter of the way through, and this obnoxious dumbass is already on my last nerve. I should have just let him go to trial'this is excruciating.' Mueller later conceded that he was happy that Manafort hadn't flipped yet because he doesn't think he could handle '30 seconds in a room with that annoying shithead.'"

'Wow, it is so hypocritical of the first lady to criticize cyberbullying when she's married to a man who regularly uses social media to harass and torment people,' said Morelli, using his shrewd acumen to alert readers to the complex paradox, which most unthinking plebeians lack the brilliance to discern.'I mean, seriously, right after she spoke, he was tweeting insults about his political opponents.

'It's clear that the disgusting and disgraceful voters are going to try to influence the midterms'the voters must be stopped!' said Trump in a series of tweets, asserting that millions of voters were potentially involved in a massive, coordinated effort to handpick election winners. 'I've been hearing about all these voters who are already plotting to go to their polling place, show their ID, and cast their vote all on the same day, and that's a big problem. And it's already happening, folks'just take a look at the primaries. We've got voters with ulterior motives online, too, trying to influence people by spreading information about candidates on social media. We absolutely cannot as a society allow voters to meddle in our elections, and if we don't do something, voters will try to interfere with the 2020 presidential election, too.' At press time, Trump's advisors were reportedly attempting to calm him down by reminding him that there was virtually no evidence to suggest that American voters were interested in influencing midterm elections."

'People are under the false impression that yachts come fully stocked with all the things you'd need to create a great environment, like caterers and live cellists, but they don't realize that I often have to pay out of my own pocket, and that gets very pricey,' said DeVos, revealing that under the current Department of Education budget, she was obliged to shell out of thousands of dollars to outfit her yacht with all-new bidets. 'It's really tough, because I just want to make sure that everyone who steps foot onto this vessel has an enriching experience that lasts a lifetime. We're talking about 30 or more guests at every party'it adds up quickly. Just maintaining the wine cellar accounts for nearly one-third of my salary. It's no wonder so many yacht owners get burnt out after even a short period of time.' At press time, the GoFundMe account that DeVos set up to raise money to redo her marble countertops had already hit $2.7 million in donations."
825,Michael Cohen Relieved To Remember It Illegal To Charge Lawyer With Crime,"NEW YORK'Admitting that he initially started to panic upon discovering that federal prosecutors were investigating him for charges of bank and tax fraud, Michael Cohen reportedly expressed relief Monday after remembering that it is illegal to charge a lawyer with a crime. 'Wow, I was really freaking out there for a second thinking I was definitely going to prison, but then I remembered you have immunity from all criminal charges when you're a lawyer,' said Cohen, adding that his concern over the mounting evidence that he was involved in multiple crimes while serving as President Trump's lawyer disappeared after he recalled the part of getting admitted to the bar that makes questioning a lawyer about anything they've ever done a Class A felony. 'I can't believe I almost forgot that lawyers are the part of the legal system who talk about the laws when they prosecute and defend people for crimes, not the people who actually have laws applied to them. Lawyers obviously get attorney'legal system privilege. Jeez, though, that was close.' At press time, Cohen was growing even more relaxed after recalling all the lawyers he knows who have committed scores of illegal acts and never received any punishment whatsoever."

'C'mon, just open the door, guys! I didn't mean to strip myself of access to classified information and restricted areas,' said Trump, who was forbidden from entering the premises after unwittingly writing his name on the list of individuals having their clearances revoked, thinking it was where he was supposed to place his signature. 'Please, I'm sorry! I really wanna come back inside. It was an honest mistake. Oh, no, it's starting to rain.'

'We'll have an opportunity to thoroughly vet Judge Kavanaugh's beliefs as soon as they are established precedent and a permanent part of our nation's legal framework,' said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, explaining there was no need for anyone to read Kavanaugh's thoughts on the environment or immigration since they would be readily available to the public once he sat on the Supreme Court and began issuing opinions. 'The Democrats will have decades to closely analyze Judge Kavanaugh's views on issues such as labor unions, gerrymandering, and executive power. Why should they read a million documents from his time in the George W. Bush administration when they will be able to find out most of what they need to know just by reading his majority opinion striking down Roe v. Wade?' McConnell added that Democratic criticism of Trump's nominee represented the 'same old obstructionist tactics' that in 2032 the Supreme Court will rule is legally punishable by death. "

'C'mon, c'mon, I know Trump's in here somewhere,' said Manigault-Newman as she fast-forwarded through a recording of Stephen Miller and Jeff Sessions casually using the racial slur during a conversation in the West Wing. 'I've got hours of John Kelly dropping N-bombs and a several where Trump is in the room when Bannon yells it, but I haven't found any of the president yet. One tape seemed promising, but there's a lot of crosstalk where everybody in the room was saying the N-word over each other, so you can't make out Trump clearly. Ugh, this is going to take forever.' At press time, Manigault-Newman was forced to keep looking after all that turned up so far were two dozen recordings of Trump saying 'wetback' and 'dune coon.'"

'I want to apologize to the American taxpayers for abusing my power as a public servant in the USDA, as well as everyone depending on me to supply high-level classified information from the Trump administration as the leader of QAnon,' said Ray Benjamin, 59, who stepped down from his post as a commodity grader in the Agricultural Marketing Service division of the USDA after 26 years with the agency and nearly a year posting on 4chan and 8chan as Q. 'I deeply regret failing to document my $15.35 meal, as well as several other business expenses, including a reimbursement for parking, but ultimately I must own up to my mistakes. Unfortunately, with my security clearance revoked and my access to top-secret government intelligence cut off, it means that I will no longer be capable of posting updates about The Storm, offering informed predictions of Hillary Clinton's imminent arrest, or unmasking the establishment liberals involved in a massive international human-trafficking ring. I am profoundly sorry to both the Department of Agriculture and to my QAnon supporters. I let you all down.' Reached for additional comment, Benjamin admitted that he was privately relieved that he was no longer under the obligation to run QAnon and could spend more time relaxing with his wife, gardening, and watching University of Virginia football."

'I'm shocked and completely furious that people who I generously gave jobs in my administration would turn around and use a secret recording studio during meetings,' said the president, criticizing staffers who constructed a soundproof live room, vocal isolation booth, and mixing console in the West Wing to record, monitor, and master his statements in high fidelity without his knowledge. 'I trusted these people not to sit me down and do a soundcheck, request that I do multiple takes, and play back my statements in the room until everyone agrees we've got what we're looking for. I had no idea Omarosa was making suggestions about my microphone placement in between working with the audio engineer during takes, and, frankly, it's a disgrace.'

'No, no, no! No! Aw, jeez, this is really bad,' said the panicked FBI investigator, frantically scooping handfuls of partially melted purple ice off of a painstakingly transcribed and annotated Michael Flynn interview back into its original 32-ounce plastic cup with his hands and attempting to blot it dry with an extra copy of the evidence inventory from his raid on Michael Cohen's office. 'Everyone's going to be so mad at me for having my soda next to so much important stuff. Maybe if I spread it all out and let it dry, no one will notice? Dang it. I can't believe I did this twice in one week.'

'Though we are grateful for the vice president's interest in national defense, the prospect of using seraphim-targeted bombs and heretic-seeking missiles to protect America from hostile sinners is not feasible, nor indeed useful, at this time,' said Secretary of Defense James Mattis, graciously thanking Pence for his hand-drawn schematics of a proposed Holy Ghost cloaking device that would allow planes to fly undetected above the homes of prostitutes and thieves. 'Obviously, we cannot plan our defense against North Korea around the face of God appearing before Kim Jong-un and turning him into a pillar of salt, but it's not like I can tell the vice president of the United States to stop talking. Luckily, he wound down after explaining how the Gabriel's Trumpet Alert System worked, which is just as well, because apparently the idea behind it is that we would just all ascend bodily into Heaven, which in many ways contradicts our current strategic goals.' The National Guard, however, may consider Pence's contingency plans for non-lethal counters to possible civil unrest, saying the idea of a crowd-dispersing holy water cannon is 'not completely without merit.'"

838,Giuliani Demands Mueller Wrap Up Investigation And Imprison President By September,"NEW YORK'Saying that the affair was rapidly deteriorating into a boondoggle that should have been resolved months ago, presidential lawyer Rudy Giuliani demanded Thursday that Special Counsel Robert Mueller stop wasting taxpayer money, wrap up his investigation immediately, and imprison the president no later than September. 'This inquiry into President Trump's dealings with Russia has clearly run its course, and it's high time that the FBI cuts to the chase and arrests him for his crimes,' said Giuliani, adding that the special counsel's investigation into Trump's business practices was 'a step too far' and that Mueller's team almost certainly had enough information on election interference alone to incarcerate the president before Labor Day. 'The American people deserve better than this. If the special counsel were any sort of professional, he would publicly admit what everyone knows'that he has all the evidence he needs to build an airtight case against Trump. Dragging this out is a disgrace, a mockery of our legal system. Look, we're just asking for Mueller to convict the president by the midterms, or the White House will ask Congress to dissolve his team and put Trump in prison ourselves.' In a clear challenge to Mueller's authority, Giuliani then reported to Hazelton Federal Penitentiary to serve a three-to-five year service for aiding and abetting treasonous behavior against the United States."
839,Shy Congressman Wishes Other Lawmakers Would Include Him In Their Crimes,"WASHINGTON'Saying he just wants to fit in with his colleagues, shy Rep. Harold Olsen confided to reporters Wednesday that he often feels left out of all the illegal activities going on in Congress and wishes his fellow lawmakers would include him in their crimes. 'I see everyone around me committing these felonies'embezzlement, tax evasion, insider trading'and all I want is to join in and be a part of it,' said the bashful congressman from South Carolina, adding that he knows a lot about racketeering and wire fraud, as well as making false statements to federal investigators, and would thus have a lot to offer. 'I saw a group of high-ranking congressmen chatting the other day, and I wanted to ask if I could join their money-laundering scheme, but I lost my nerve. It's so intimidating to approach these guys because they've been committing crimes together for years, even decades. But I know if someone gave me a chance, I could prove I'm every bit as seedy as they are. I've been misusing public funds on my own for so long'imagine how much we could steal if we worked together!' Olsen added that maybe he could impress his colleagues by inviting them out on the boat he bought with campaign contributions."

'You get a taste for immigrant children suffering and then you're always chasing the dragon'now I need at least half a dozen articles about kids being abused by their captors just to get to normal,' said the president's senior advisor, absentmindedly scratching his arm and pacing back and forth as he sought out photos of crying Mexican mothers, lice-covered infants, or anything else that could provide him with a moment of much-needed release. 'The hundreds of families still separated kept me going for a while there, and of course those reports of children being forever changed when they reconnected with their parents were some really good shit. But it's just not enough anymore. I'm totally jonesing for something big, like an ICE detention center catching fire and burning everyone alive'something that can really get me off.' At press time, a blissed-out Miller had reportedly worked up a pretty good buzz looking at videos of tortured Libyan refugees who were barred from entering the United States under President Trump's travel ban.

'I was just a pauper sleeping on the streets of D.C. when I was approached by a peculiar, top-hatted young man, as dirty a juvenile as you'd ever see, but with all the airs of a gentleman,' Gates told prosecutors, explaining that after swiping a bushel of apples from a nearby street vendor, Manafort had introduced him to a gang of ragamuffins headed by an old, shriveled wretch by the name of Roger Stone. 'They taught me their ways, and before long, I was filching right proper. Whenever a rich mark would come along, Manafort would distract him while I snuck up behind him and filched his pocket-book or snuff box. Sure, we had to scamper off any time the coppers turned up, but it sure beat living in the workhouse.' Gates confirmed that his partnership with Manafort would have likely continued indefinitely had they not been caught in an unsuccessful attempt to steal Robert Mueller's monogrammed handkerchief."
845,Russian Orphans Devastated After Realizing Trump Tower Meeting Not About Getting Them Adopted,"NORILSK, RUSSIA'Following the president's disclosure that the purpose of the controversial June 2016 Trump Tower meeting was in fact held to collect opposition research on Hillary Clinton, hundreds of Russian orphans were devastated Monday after realizing that Donald Trump Jr. did not in fact call Russian lobbyists to the headquarters of his father's business in order to arrange their adoptions. 'We truly believed the nice Americans were going to save us from this hopeless life of hardship and toil,' said Evgeny Mikhailov, age 9, tearfully unpacking a small suitcase in his boarding house room in a frigid industrial city at the northernmost edges of Siberia and comforting his six hungry, tired siblings as best he could while they sobbed themselves to sleep. 'This was the glimmer of hope we needed after the tractor factory took our Mamka and Papenka, but we learn now that all is a sham. We thought the Americans really cared for us, but they were just trying to cover their deceitful tracks.' The more than 25,000 orphans betrayed by the scandal have gone on record to express their satisfaction at learning how President Putin was at least helping oppose the deceitful Trump by supporting American Democrats."

'Despite reports that I'm concerned about my wonderful son being sent to jail, I actually think there wouldn't be much harm at all if he was imprisoned for a decade or so,' said the president, directly contradicting previous reports that he had expressed worry to aides about his son facing legal repercussions for meeting with Russian agents by noting that Donald Jr. was a 'resilient kid' who could easily weather a stint in a federal penitentiary until 2025. 'Look, my son is young, he's got a good head on his shoulders'I bet he'd do absolutely fantastic behind bars. Frankly, I've just got no problem with him getting locked up in a cell until he's around 50. And, honestly, any news story telling you otherwise is a complete fabrication.' Trump also dismissed claims that he had any qualms about never seeing Jared Kushner again if his senior advisor were to receive a life sentence for treason."
848,White House Reporters Warn Huckabee Sanders She Harming America And It's Selling Like Fucking Hotcakes,"WASHINGTON'In a statement intended to send a strong message to the White House press secretary in response to her controversial and adversarial remarks regarding the media, press corps reporters united Friday to warn Sarah Huckabee Sanders that her veiled accusations and outright untruths were doing deep, untold harm to America and the results were selling like fucking hotcakes. 'Secretary Sanders, the pattern of distrust you and the president have established towards the constitutionally protected practice of the First Amendment is eroding Americans' faith in their nation's most fundamental institutions, and we'll be goddamned if people aren't eating it right the hell up,' said NBC's Kasie Hunt, who cautioned Sanders that she was in danger of going down in history as the press secretary who spread discord among the American people, threatened the free press, and waged war on freedom of in speech in general, all of which have grown readership like nobody's business. 'Each day that you stand behind the podium and call the press the enemy of the American people is another day you corrode the fundamental trust at the heart of democracy's basic social contract, and also another deadline where we can just record what you say verbatim, print it, and beat our circulation goals by 35 percent.' Immediately following her statement, Hunt was drowned out by other members of the White House press corps fighting to thank Sanders for keeping their respective publications in the black. "

'Paul is a savvy businessman, an upstanding member of his community, and, above all else, one of my closest friends,' said Macanga, a warlord personally responsible for the brutal slaughter of thousands of innocent women and children during the Angolan Civil War. 'When I was down on my luck during a particularly difficult diamond smuggling operation, Paul stood by me. And when I was almost assassinated in a coup by my own soldiers, Paul lent me the money to pay the mercenary I used to hunt down and murder the families of those who betrayed me. I wouldn't be where I am today if it weren't for that defendant right there, Paul Manafort.' At press time, Manafort's defense called up their next witness, a trembling former intern who insisted his boss was a great guy who never once threatened to break his fucking legs so bad he'd be walking sideways the rest of his life."
850,Ivanka Trump Distraught After Learning Detained Migrant Children Completely Without Sewing Machines,"WASHINGTON''While being briefed on the inhumane, unsanitary, often abusive conditions in facilities housing more than 700 immigrant children who have been separated from their families for months on end, White House advisor and first daughter Ivanka Trump was distraught to learn Thursday that none of the detainees from ages 1 to 12 had even the most basic access to sewing machines. 'When I think of those poor kids, caged so far from the factories where they belong, it just breaks my heart,' said Trump, as her chin quivered at the mere thought of the hundreds of young children who had been stripped of their right to make designer bags, shoes, and clothing. 'These poor little children have the ideal hand and finger size to make small, precise stitches in profitable designer clothing, and any decent sweatshop should be able to find more than enough room for them. It's deeply upsetting to picture them just waiting on a cold, empty concrete floor without a single purse or jacket to sew. That any child, regardless of national origin, should be treated like this is an unthinkable waste, and I intend to personally see that these children are reunited with their sewing machines immediately.' Ms. Trump later announced the establishment of the Ivanka Trump Collection Foundation, which will donate thousands of dollars' worth of garment-making equipment to ICE facilities."
851,Sessions Vows To Protect All Deeply Held Religious Bigotry,"WASHINGTON'Standing firm in his commitment to one of the nation's guiding principles, Attorney General Jeff Sessions went on record Wednesday vowing to protect the deeply held religious bigotry of all Americans. 'Dating back to colonial times, America has been a place where individuals are free to live in accordance with their own personal prejudices, and I'm dedicated to ensuring our people retain the right to discriminate against others based upon their religion,' said Sessions, condemning what he described as secular trends within society that threaten the freedom to treat people as second-class citizens if they adhere to a different faith or no faith at all. 'I was raised in a devoutly intolerant household, so I understand the importance of being allowed to hate in whatever way one sees fit. To me, that's what being an American is all about.' In his closing remarks, Sessions warned that surrendering the right to discriminate according to religion could be the start of a slippery slope that ends with Americans losing their sacred right to discriminate according to gender, sexual orientation, or even race."

Sulzberger revealed Sunday that he asked President Trump to decrease his anti-media rhetoric during their July 20 meeting, excepting those made against 'those fuckers at The Washington Post.' 'We urged him to back off of reporters and editors who are performing not just their jobs for their respective news organizations, but a valuable public service, and as members of a free press in a free country, should not have to feel their lives are at risk. I also entreated him to to join us in uniting against those WaPo shitasses,' said Sulzberger, emphasizing that Washington Post journalists should not be exempt from being mercilessly ridiculed by Trump and anyone who consumes media. 'Using the term 'fake news' is harmful for all non-Washington Post staffers involved and creates an unsafe adversarial atmosphere that should be reserved for enemies of our country, such as, say, all Washington Post staffers. If this borderline slander continues, it could conceivably lead to violence against respected and skilled journalists who work for credible media organizations, which of course excludes the Post. I think we left that meeting with a real understanding that Trump should tone it down a bit, and redirect his vitriol where it belongs, toward those Washington Post dumbfucks.' At press time, Sulzberger believed Trump had listened to his arguments after learning that The Washington Post would be banned from all White House press briefings. "
854,Trump Denies Existence Of 2016 Russia Meeting Commemorative Merchandise,"WASHINGTON'Saying the reports were a ludicrous attempt by the mainstream media to discredit him, President Donald Trump vehemently denied Monday the existence of 2016 Russia meeting commemorative merchandise available at the Trump Tower gift shop. 'There is absolutely no evidence to suggest that exquisite, handcrafted Trump'Russia meeting decorative plates are on sale for just $39.99 per plate or $199.99 for the entire six-plate set,' said the president, noting that if such collectibles did exist, they would no doubt feature the portraits and signatures of those who attended the meeting as well as a bonus silver souvenir spoon hand-stamped with the date '6/9/16' at no extra charge. 'Despite what CNN might tell you, there is no proof that special-edition T-shirts featuring my son Donald Jr. making a handshake deal with Russian nationals to provide our campaign with dirt on Hillary Clinton are going fast and won't be on the racks for long. Furthermore, we cannot corroborate that a 2016 Russia Meeting stein handsomely emblazoned with the word 'COLLUSION' would make the perfect gift for birthdays, anniversaries, or graduations.' At press time, Trump denied that the low-low prices on the commemorative merchandise would be affected by recent tariffs on Chinese goods."

'Come on, Don, keep your eyes super wide open so the memory ray can work,' said the 34-year-old, shining a Trump Organization-branded laser pointer into Donald Jr.'s eyes while repeatedly shouting 'You don't remember the bad stuff! You don't remember the bad stuff!' 'It might hurt for a little bit while the memories are going away, but don't move or it could give you total amnesia. Here, drink this, too. It's a forgetfulness potion I made out of all the pills in Dad's medicine cabinet. He takes 'em all the time and he never remembers nothing.' At press time, a frustrated Eric lost patience and instead opted to use a hammer to smash the memories out of Donald Jr.'s brain."
857,House Conservatives Introduce Resolution To Impale Rod Rosenstein,"WASHINGTON'Claiming that the United States Deputy Attorney General had failed to uphold his oath of office, 11 Congressional conservatives reportedly introduced a resolution Thursday to impale Rod Rosenstein. 'Mr. Rosenstein's tenure has been marked by rampant partisanship, leaving us with no choice but to move forward with articles of impalement,' said Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, telling reporters that, if approved, the motion would require Rosenstein to immediately have his body driven through by a 20-foot pike on the steps of the Capitol Building as a warning to all who would defy the president. 'Time and again, Mr. Rosenstein has crossed the line in his investigation into Russian meddling, and we intend to make a statement against these outrages by lancing him from anus to mouth, leaving him alive to scream in agony as he slowly exsanguinates.'At press time, the resolution had stalled after House Republicans were unable to reach a consensus about whether Rosenstein's eyes should be immediately gouged out or remain in place to be eaten by crows. "
858,White House Press Corps Wishes Show Of Solidarity Over Banned Reporter Could Be For Better News Organization Than CNN,"WASHINGTON'Even as they united behind journalist Kaitlan Collins after the Trump administration barred her from attending a press conference with the president, the White House press corps reportedly admitted Thursday that they wished their show of solidarity over a banned reporter could be for a better news organization than CNN. 'Obviously, we'll stand behind any news outlet that has its access suspended, but did it really have to be CNN?' said NBC News chief White House correspondent Hallie Jackson, echoing the sentiments of her colleagues who begrudgingly agreed that any move to infringe upon one reporter's journalistic freedoms, even if it was someone from CNN, was an assault on the entire free press. 'Although we'd much rather stand up for someone from, say, the New York Times, or C-SPAN, or, Christ, even The Hill, it's important to inform the White House that blocking any news organization from a press event will not be tolerated. Journalists are here to ask tough questions and keep the public informed, and even if they represent a network that never does those things, a ban like this sets a grave precedent. Solidarity with'ugh'CNN.' At press time, CNN senior White House correspondent Jeff Zeleny issued a statement thanking the press corps for coming together to support holding the powerful accountable and also for whatever it is that CNN does."
859,"Trump Vindicated After Rest Of Leaked Recording Reveals Him Urging Racial Reconciliation, Calling For Interfaith Dialogue, Condemning Gender Inequality","WASHINGTON'Expressing relief that the leaked recording of his meeting with lawyer Michael Cohen revealed more than merely his practice of paying hush money to his mistresses, President Donald Trump told the reporters Thursday that he felt 'vindicated' by the captured conversation, during which he clearly and unequivocally demonstrated his yearning for reconciliation between the races, called for an earnest and compassionate ongoing dialogue among those of different faiths, and unequivocally condemned the rampant gender inequality at all levels of American society. 'Sure, it might look like I'm only concerned with silencing a Playmate in exchange for a large sum of money, but that's only because the crooked media edited out my call for Americans of all colors, creeds, and convictions to finally come together as one people and embrace the differences that are ultimately our chief source of strength, instead of using them to sow further discord,' said the 45th president of the United States, citing a section at the recording's 12-minute mark where he was heard challenging his 'brothers and sisters in democracy' to work together and uplift traditionally marginalized groups. 'This is far from the first time my words have been taken out of context. Yet this incident only serves to strengthen my resolve. My message was clear then, and it's clear today: We cannot move forward as a nation unless and until we atone for generations of systemic oppression by committing all our resources to opposing that oppression in all its forms, because the only true measure of a society is in its treatment of its most vulnerable members.' At press time, a Pew Research Center poll showed Trump's approval rating plummeting to 1 percent among Republicans."
860,Huckabee Sanders Claims Playing Cohen Tape Backward Reveals Hidden Message Exonerating Trump From All Wrongdoing,"WASHINGTON'Explaining that the release of the secretly recorded conversation between Donald Trump and Michael Cohen could not have come at a better time, Sarah Huckabee Sanders stated Wednesday that playing the tape backward reveals a hidden message exonerating Trump from any misconduct. 'I can confirm that if you play these recordings backward and at half speed, you can clearly hear the voice of Barack Obama saying, 'We should frame Donald Trump so people think it was him, not me, who had all those extramarital affairs,' and then Cohen saying, 'You're my best client, Barack,'' said the White House press secretary, adding that if you turn the treble all the way up and listen closely around the tape's six-minute mark, you can make out former Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz instructing staffers to steal hacked email servers. 'President Trump is actually quite grateful for the release of this tape, as it provides conclusive proof that investigations into his financial transactions and personal life are merely witch hunts meant to distract Americans from the real issues. Try it at home and hear the truth for yourself.' Huckabee Sanders went on to add that, later in the tape, one hears the voices of both Bill and Hillary Clinton confessing to the murder of Vince Foster."
861,Michael Cohen Promises More Damaging Recordings Of Trump Already Public,"NEW YORK'Saying the leaked audio of Donald Trump approving a payment to ensure the silence of a former Playboy model had 'barely scratched the surface,' embattled attorney Michael Cohen promised Wednesday that even more damaging recordings were widely available to the public already. 'You may think this is bad'the president agreeing to reimburse the $150,000 paid out to a woman he allegedly had a yearlong affair with'but trust me, there is a lot more where that came from, and it's been airing nonstop on every major news network for three years now,' said Cohen, who later teased some of the thousands of potentially compromising statements that are readily accessible on the president's personal Twitter account and have been since 2009. 'What came out yesterday is just the tip of the iceberg. There's actually a taped conversation with Lester Holt in which Trump openly admits to obstructing justice, and many, many other tapes in which he offers effusive praise for murderous dictators like Kim Jong-un and Rodrigo Duterte.' At press time, sources confirmed Cohen had taken to social media to alert Americans to the October 2016 release of a recording containing an extremely damning conversation where Trump admitted to sexually assaulting women while speaking with former Access Hollywood correspondent Billy Bush."

'Wait, doesn't anyone remember? We arrested a bunch of people and shut down the whole thing. Where were you guys?' said the baffled special counsel, carefully recounting the FBI's painstaking interrogation and evidence-collection processes, which culminated in a series of trials that had been televised and broadcast across every major television network. 'Seriously, I was on TV every day for, like, six months straight. We got nine people arrested on counts of high treason and uncovered a 30-person ring of Russian dark-web cybercriminals. Remember? Is this seriously not ringing any bells?' At press time, Mueller bashfully acknowledged that most of the suspects were eventually released on legal technicalities."

'I'm sorry to duck out like this, but I'm running late for an important date in Moscow. Ciao, Robert,' said Butina, who tossed a French tickler on the special counsel's bare chest before emptying his wallet, grabbing his gun and FBI identification, and pocketing a small flash drive. 'Don't take this too personally, Robert, I've had a lot of fun, but I just don't think we have much of a future together. You can always drop me a line next time you're in Russia.' At press time, Butina was in the back of a limousine, wiping away a tear while gazing at the necklace Mueller had gifted her earlier that day."
871,Dozens Of White Houses Materialize From Temporal Vortex As Trump's Changing Account Of Putin Meeting Tears Apart Space-Time,"WASHINGTON'Revealing that the physical world could no longer bear the weight of numerous contradictory realities, sources confirmed Friday that dozens of Whites Houses have begun to leak from a temporal vortex as President Trump's rapidly changing story of meeting Putin tears apart space-time. 'A White House is blinking in and out of reality atop the Washington Monument, and another has materialized inside the wall of a Georgetown apartment building'it appears the fourth dimensional plane is collapsing in on itself as Trump's untenable, competing statements rupture the very foundation of time and relativity,' said astrophysicist Maria Steagall, who confirmed an entire unit of the Army National Guard was instantly vaporized attempting to enter the vortex, and several members of the White House press corps were reportedly stretched out for the entire length of the Milky Way Galaxy and then collapsed to the size of a single atom after simply trying to make sense of the president's conflicting remarks. 'One witness reported seeing 6,000 Mike Pences pouring out of a small wormhole in the Cabinet room before suddenly vanishing. Countless universes are colliding and folding over each other every time Trump disputes his earlier statements; this is one of the greatest traumas the fabric of the universe has suffered since the Big Bang. In fact, the sheer heat being created by all these Putin stories battling each other to stabilize space-time may cause a black hole to form at the Earth's core, causing the planet to implode.' At press time, scientists studying the vortex had confirmed that Trump was President in every single Earth reality and would be forever."
872,Senate Passes Bipartisan Resolution Preventing Themselves From Stopping Trump,"WASHINGTON'In a sharp rebuke of the President's failure to denounce Russia for interfering in the 2016 election, the Senate passed a bipartisan resolution Friday preventing themselves from stopping Trump. 'Today, in service to the American people, we set aside our differences and reached across the aisle to send President Trump an important message; we will not be the ones to keep him in check,' said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, detailing the Congressional Paralyzation Act, which passed in a 98-0 floor vote and decreed that no member of congress shall attempt to impede the President's actions, regardless of how illegal or immoral. 'Finally, after months of infighting and delay, our hands are officially tied when it comes to Donald Trump. The president must understand that we will not, and as of today cannot, do anything to stop him. With the support of our colleagues in the House, we remain steadfast in doing absolutely nothing whatsoever to curb his power.' At press time, Senators who had originally rejected the bill, including Jeff Flake and Susan Collins, had taken to social media to explain why they had ultimately changed their votes to 'yes.'"
873,"FBI Reveals Maria Butina Traded Sex In Exchange For All 62,984,828 Votes Trump Received In 2016","WASHINGTON'Saying that their investigation indicated her involvement in election interference went deeper than previously believed, the FBI revealed Thursday that Russian agent Maria Butina traded sex in exchange for all 62,984,828 votes Donald Trump received for president in 2016. 'Our inquiry into Ms. Butina recently lead us to documents showing that while acting as a Kremlin asset, she approached every single registered voter in the country and, ultimately, exchanged sexual favors for each of the nearly 63 million votes President Trump received,' said FBI spokesperson Fred Rawlings, adding that the investigation had also concluded that every single dollar Trump received from donors such as Robert Mercer, Sheldon Adelson, and Linda McMahon was given as compensation for sex with Butina. 'Beginning in at least 2011, Ms. Butina successfully established back channels with a significant portion of the nation's 235 million citizens of voting age, ultimately trading enough sex to win Mr. Trump the election. It was clearly a fairly sophisticated operation, as Ms. Butina used intelligence gathered about American voters to target people willing to exchange their vote for sex in specific, crucial swing areas such as the upper Midwest, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina as Election Day approached. Our conclusions are clear: Without Ms. Butina's sexual favors, Mr. Trump doesn't win the election.' FBI officials added that the investigation into Butina's involvement concurred with the intelligence community's earlier findings that Hillary Clinton's campaign likely lost the 2016 election because it did not offer enough sex to voters."
874,Paul Ryan Worried History May Judge Him Harshly For Failure To Confront Tyrannical Food Stamp Abusers,"WASHINGTON'Expressing concern that he had not done enough to stop the oppressive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters Wednesday that he was worried history may judge him harshly for his failure to confront the ruthless tyranny of government food stamp abusers. 'What will I say when my grandchildren ask, 'What did Grandpa Paul do to prevent those cruel and remorseless monsters from collecting $125 per month to spend at the supermarket?'' asked Ryan, who hopes he won't be viewed as a coward by future generations for not speaking out sooner against the powerful children, seniors, and disabled people who comprise the majority of SNAP's 40 million low-wage recipients. 'How can I sleep at night knowing there are still despotic poor families out there buying groceries and other basic necessities totally unimpeded? God, it just kills me.' At press time, a resolute Ryan decided wallowing accomplishes nothing and resolved to focus his remaining time as House Speaker on saving the country from the iron-fisted rule of impoverished Americans."
875,Mueller Reveals Russia Investigation Just Elaborate Sting To Nail Clinton Child Sex-Slavery Ring,"WASHINGTON'Lauding President Trump for his invaluable role in the operation, Special Counsel Robert Mueller informed the public Wednesday that his so-called Russia investigation was in fact merely a cover for an elaborate sting to bring down the Clinton family's child sex-slavery ring. 'The Justice Department has finally been able to track down and arrest everyone associated with the Clinton Foundation's unconscionable crimes, and it's all thanks to President Trump agreeing to work undercover and play along with our fabricated accusations of Russian interference in the 2016 election,' said Mueller, explaining that after its agent Seth Rich was killed by the Clintons, the department recruited Trump to distract high-ranking Democrats with social media stunts, continuous denials of Russian involvement in U.S. politics, and glowing praise for Vladimir Putin. 'Without the president's help, we never would have been able to keep the guise of the 'Russia investigation' going long enough to launch our successful raids of Comet Ping Pong and secret locations in Haiti'efforts that ultimately brought the Clintons' human-trafficking crimes to light. Thanks to the heroic actions of Donald Trump, we can all sleep a little more soundly tonight, knowing the world's children are safe.' Mueller went on to thank the numerous media personalities and Republican lawmakers who first pointed out to federal investigators that the real problem lay in Hillary Clinton's missing emails."
876,Senate Leaders Warn It Too Early To Discuss Trump,"WASHINGTON'In response to public outcry over his recent controversial press conference with Russian president Vladimir Putin, Senate leaders cautioned Tuesday that it was far too early to discuss Trump. 'We understand that many Americans may not agree with everything the president says, but these calls for the Senate to start conversing or thinking about Trump are entirely premature,' said Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY), echoing sentiments from fellow Democratic leaders and several Republicans that it would be rash and self-defeating to bring up Trump in the Senate without ample reason to do so. 'We're aware that a few members of the House of Representatives have initiated proceedings to raise the idea of Trump, but what activists and left-leaning politicians need to remember is that impulsively throwing around the concept of Trump will likely do much more harm than good. At this point, there's just no evidence that we should mention the word 'Trump' in the Senate at all.' Schumer also warned that historical precedent had revealed there was very little benefit to be gained from discussing a sitting president in an election year."
877,World Wonders What Trump Has On United States That's Forcing Nation To Keep Him In Power,"EARTH'Assuming the controversial president of the United States must be in possession of potentially damning information concerning his home country in order to keep them so completely under his control, the rest of the world wondered aloud Tuesday about exactly what Trump has on America that compels the nation to keep him in power. 'Whoa, he must have some real bad dirt on the U.S. populace for them to just let him get away with so much unconscionable bullshit. You have to wonder what he knows,' said billions of world inhabitants outside of President Trump's jurisdiction, further speculating that the only possible explanation for the continued deference of American elected officials, American media, and American citizens to an obviously corrupt and incompetent leader would be Trump's possession of damaging information that could take down the entire country. 'There's no way a truly proud and free nation would put up with this if Trump weren't blackmailing them with something really, really bad'something so unspeakably heinous that it would destroy their country if anyone found out. Otherwise, why wouldn't they nail this asshole to a burning outhouse?' At press time, the world was experiencing a sinking feeling that Trump may have compromising information on them as well."

'God, I can't believe I've wasted more than a year of my life working on something the president thinks is foolish, dumb, and'worst of all'a distraction,' said a visibly upset Mueller, shaking his head as he reminded himself to drop all charges against Paul Manafort and anyone who was arrested or pleaded guilty during the investigation before feeding hundreds of pages of warrants, subpoenas, and indictments into the raging flames. 'It's a real shame because I thought I was getting close to something with those Trump Organization wiretaps, but when the president says you're being reckless, you listen. Frankly, I just hope he takes Putin up on his incredible offer to work with the Kremlin on a more honest investigation.' At press time, Mueller's actions had been applauded by the heads of the FBI, CIA, and NSA, who also announced plans to immediately suspend their operations pending review by the White House."
881,Supporters Praise Trump For Upholding Traditional American Value Of Supporting Murderous Dictators For Political Gain,"WASHINGTON'In the aftermath of the president's controversial meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin in Finland, supporters reportedly praised Donald Trump Tuesday for upholding the traditional American value of supporting murderous dictators for political gain. 'It is a proud moment in American history to witness President Trump embracing one of our most cherished principles by ingratiating himself with a foreign tyrant in the service of advancing his political goals,' said Layton, UT resident Carl Fredericks, echoing thunderous approval from dozens of the president's allies in Congress and the media, as well as millions of voters around the country, for using a meeting with the leader of a repressive regime as an opportunity to get on his good side. 'What we saw from President Trump at the summit was an outstanding commitment to maintaining our proud national tradition of cozying up to brutal dictators and sweeping their crimes against humanity under the rug if it's politically expedient to do so. When Trump chose to side with a murderous despot who has violently eliminated his enemies, cracked down on civil liberties, and caused widespread suffering among his people, he showed beyond a shadow of a doubt that he's an American president in the mold of his predecessors. He's a true patriot.' In addition, Trump's supporters praised him for his continued efforts to uphold the longstanding presidential tradition of getting America involved in foreign conflicts they were in no way prepared for out of sheer arrogance and hubris."
882,GOP Leaders Move Goalposts On Opposing Trump To Him Being Filmed Masturbating On U.S. Flag In Arlington Cemetery,"WASHINGTON'Promising citizens that they would finally take action if the President crossed this new red line, GOP leaders announced Monday that they were moving their goalposts for opposing Trump to him being filmed masturbating on an American flag in Arlington National Cemetery. 'After today's attack on U.S. intelligence agencies, we have officially moved our line in the sand to President Trump being caught on video, vigorously pleasuring himself to completion amid the graves of fallen U.S. soldiers,' said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who claimed that in order for Republican officials to begin blocking Trump's nominations or voting against his policies, the video must be at least a half hour of the president with his pants around his ankles, humming the national anthem, and giving the middle finger to the Tomb Of The Unknown Soldier. 'Unless we see clear footage of President Trump looking into the camera, his face twisting in pleasure as he climaxes, we will refrain from taking any concrete measures to reel him in. If Trump is masturbating on a flag anywhere other than Arlington, or if he does not ejaculate directly on Old Glory, we will continue to stand behind him. And if fewer than 100 eyewitnesses see him engaged in the masturbation, we will dismiss it as hearsay. Of course, it goes without saying that if he claims it was a joke, all will be forgiven.' McConnell added that Republicans would stand firm on their new line for President Trump except in the extraordinary circumstance of another open seat on the Supreme Court."

'When interviewed, the overwhelming majority of Americans did not recognize Donald Trump's name, did not know he was associated with the federal government, and were unable to state whether he was a living person or a historical figure,' said pollster Jason Costello, adding that an even greater proportion of survey respondents, 99 percent, could not point to the correct picture when presented with photographs of the president and three other people. 'Approximately 89 percent of the individuals we questioned merely shrugged or shook their heads upon hearing the words 'Donald Trump,' while 7 percent said the name sounded vaguely familiar, but they couldn't quite place it. Another 2 percent incorrectly identified Trump as the owner of the Dallas Cowboys.' The survey also discovered that an alarming 18 percent of Americans were unable to name current Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue."

'This is exactly the sort of bombshell that a lot of conservative analysts have been worried about,' said NPR political reporter Asma Khalid, noting that several key Republican senators were questioning their endorsement after learning the D.C. Circuit judge had flagrantly decided to work late at the office instead of listening to his then-8-year-old daughter plunk out 'The Sleepy Cat' for an audience of students, parents, and faculty. 'Susan Collins of Maine, for instance, has already signaled that she has serious doubts about Kavanaugh's commitment to protecting women's rights if, as reported, it took him until the following morning to view the iPad footage of his own daughter's culminating musical performance. Though supporters will claim he put the wrong date in his Google calendar or that he ran into traffic on the way to the school, this black mark on his record has many concerned that Kavanaugh simply does not have the judgment or moral integrity to serve on the nation's highest court.' Khalid also cautioned that Kavanaugh's nomination should not be counted out entirely, pointing to a blistering Wall Street Journal opinion piece that failed to derail Justice Sonia Sotomayor's nomination despite persuasively arguing that she is of Hispanic descent."

'Now what exactly did you mean when you said Trey Gowdy was a 'dickless fuck-weasel who couldn't investigate his way out of a goddamn paper bag'?' asked Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte during an oftentimes heated exchange in which Strzok defended sending numerous text messages to former FBI attorney Lisa Page that referred to the Republican Congressman from South Carolina as a 'slavering, knuckle-dragging dipshit.' 'Mr. Strzok, I have a message here from today at 11:45 a.m. in which you call Representative Gowdy a 'reprobate fuckface whose biggest claim to fame is pissing away $8 million of taxpayer money for a dumbass, partisan circle-jerk,' suggesting that this level of bias existed from the earliest stages of this morning's questions. There are dozens more messages just like this, calling our distinguished colleague a 'pointless fuckwad' and a 'moronic scumbag' that I would like submitted for the record.'

'God, it feels so naughty'it really is naughty'but after weeks of opposing the welfare state on a non-corporate level, I get an incredible rush by voting across the aisle,' said Ryan, noting the 'delicious transgressive spice' of joining hands with Democratic members of Congress to fund the Veterans Administration's efforts to provide mental health counseling for American soldiers who had been wounded in combat. 'That was wrong. I know that. But there's an upside to this'after the thrill of my brief rebellious phase fades, I'll realize I actually provided help for American citizens, and the anger and regret I feel over that will help keep me on the straight and narrow party line for the rest of the year.' At press time, the House speaker had been sighted on his hands and knees in the street in front of Capitol building, pledging between spasms of dry heaving that he would never let himself slip up like that again."

'I'm sorry to get so sentimental, but this is really the first time in my life that I've ever even come close to experiencing a real sense of camaraderie with other human beings,' said a sniffling Trump, his voice cracking while noting that he can't remember a time prior to their yearly summits when he felt like he belonged and could be his true self. 'I know that we argue and say some really horrible things to each other sometimes, but this relationship I have with all of you is so special to me. The bond that the 29 of us share is my dearest, most cherished possession, and I will treasure it always.' Trump then asked his allies to forgive his emotional display before reminding them that if they don't put forward the full 4 percent of their GDP for defense, they can 'all fucking forget about receiving any U.S. military support in the future.'"
891,Trump Demands NATO Allies Match U.S. Commitment To Prioritizing Military Spending Over Healthcare,"BRUSSELS'Blasting member states for failing to contribute their 'fair share,' President Trump demanded at a summit meeting Wednesday that NATO allies match the U.S. commitment to making military spending a far greater national priority than healthcare. 'In the United States, we've gone above and beyond to make sure military expenditures are our number one concern above all else, including access to life-saving medications for sick people, and it's high time other NATO countries did the same,' said Trump, lambasting German chancellor Angela Merkel and other leaders who he remarked 'really ought to be spending maybe even 50 percent of their GDP' on defense instead of endlessly sinking funds into essential medical care for their citizens. 'It's absolutely disgraceful how the United States comes in and picks up the slack for these nations who insist on throwing their money away on the prevention and treatment of deadly diseases. It's an embarrassment, everyone's laughing at us, and I'll tell you what'we aren't going to put up with it anymore.' Representatives from the 28 other NATO countries later issued statements concurring with Trump's assessment that the United States has become a laughingstock."

The Onion answers the most important questions about the Supreme Court upholding the travel ban. Q: What does President Trump's executive action do? A: Helps ease the burden of America's immigrant detention centers by just turning people away at the airport. Q: When did Trump file the original travel ban? A: Shortly after the beginning of his term in 2017, nearly 300 years ago. Q: Who will be exempted from the travel ban? A: Anyone with a valid tourist or terrorist visa. Q: Wait, didn't Trump say America's federal courts are weak and unjust? A: Sure, except when they're strong and fair! Q: Did the current composition of the Supreme Court affect the ruling? A: Yes, experts say the ban was only upheld due to the appointment of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court in 2016 by President Mitch McConnell. Q: How are human rights groups reacting to the Supreme Court's decision? A: The ACLU has released its 29,745th 'history will judge this harshly' statement since Trump took office. Q: What future impact will this ruling have? A: Sets an important precedent for rolling back the Constitution to apply to only the people the original founding fathers intended."
896,Exasperated Huckabee Sanders Reminds Press Corps That Children Under 14 Can't Feel Pain,"WASHINGTON'Frustrated by what she called 'obvious misconceptions' related to the Trump administration's detention of thousands of migrant children who have been forcibly separated from their parents, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders reminded journalists Friday that children under the age of 14 are unable to experience pain. 'Look, no matter how much phony controversy the Democrats generate, it's a simple fact that illegal alien criminals this young are still developing the part of the brain that feels pain, goes through emotional trauma, and retains memories,' said Sanders, explaining that while migrant children may appear to be crying, screaming, or begging for their parents, they are merely attempting to mimic actions they have observed in regular humans. 'Furthermore, it's important to keep in mind that we are talking about foreign children'even if they somehow manage to see their families again, environmental factors may prevent them from developing the capacity to even recognize them. I mean, they live in cages, for God's sake.' Huckabee Sanders further noted that, were the children to actually receive the sort of care and attention necessary to develop minds and bodies capable of experiencing the pain of what they are currently going through, they would only have the child welfare policies of the Obama administration to blame."
897,Political Scientists Baffled By Trump's Ability To End Something He Had No Control Over Just Days Ago,"NEW HAVEN, CT'At a loss to explain the mysterious nature of the president's powers, political scientists were reportedly baffled Wednesday by Donald Trump's ability to end the practice of separating families who cross the U.S. border seeking asylum mere days after stating that he had no control over it. 'Just yesterday, he was explaining that his hands were tied and there was nothing he could do to stop children and infants from being forcibly torn away from their parents and put into cages'but then today, out of nowhere, he suddenly issued an executive order doing just that!' said Bruce Ackerman, a constitutional law professor at Yale University, remarking that this inexplicable development will fundamentally upend how the presidency is understood, because there is no theory in the entire field of political science that explains how it could be possible. 'No new amendments to the Constitution have been passed, so the powers vested in the Executive Branch should be the same today as they were yesterday, right? And yet somehow, they have changed! Decades of research will be required before we can even begin to comprehend such a phenomenon. In the meantime, we can only sit back and wonder if there are any other powers the president has yet to discover.' At press time, sources confirmed Ackerman and his colleagues had flipped over an original copy of the Constitution and found a list of previously unknown executive powers that appeared to have been hastily scrawled in with a ballpoint pen.

'It's unacceptable that this so-called news organization saw fit to foist this total tease of a clip on the American public,' said Miller, who expressed frustration that the audio, in which 10 detained Central American children can be heard crying out for their parents, ended before reaching 'the really good stuff.' 'Sure, they're wailing 'Mami' and 'Papa' so hard they can't breathe, and I guess the part where that 6-year-old desperately rattles off her aunt's phone number is kind of satisfying, but ultimately it only conveys a very small fraction of what we're doing here. I've listened to this recording dozens and dozens of times in the past day, and it's just simply nowhere near enough to scratch the itch. Shame on you, ProPublica.'

'Simply put, I am forced to tear kids away from their parents, because I am legally prohibited from throttling immigrants until their bodies go limp,' said Sessions, asserting that the practice of locking children away in cages and deporting their parents before they can be reunited would be reversed as soon as the law was updated to permit the attorney general to press his thumbs deep into migrants' windpipes as he watches the life fade from their eyes. 'Look, I want to see these poor immigrants dead as much as the next guy, but it's simply out of my control. I agree that it's a huge tragedy that I cannot snuff the life out of these migrants together as entire families, but I have a moral duty to follow the law as written.' At press time, Sessions called on Democrats to stop their obstructionist tactics and pass legislation granting him the ability to pin down each individual in the immigrant families and suffocate them one by one.

'Separating children from their parents is an unconscionable moral tragedy, and everyone involved should be held accountable, specifically whatever monster is responsible for bringing this criminal agency into existence,' wrote Bush in the op-ed, adding that there was nothing in ICE's 15-year history to suggest that separating families and imprisoning children in cages was in any way a deviation from the agency's intended purpose, and any official who says otherwise is either a liar or an idiot. 'Whoever is responsible for this atrocity should be tried in the Hague and punished to the fullest extent of international law. Look, ICE was obviously intended to be a punitive, discriminatory organization'it's under the jurisdiction of the Department of Homeland Security, for fuck's sake. It's a stain on America's record. I ask you to join me in calling for whoever established this agency to be thrown into prison to rot. Fuck them.' Bush's op-ed comes on the heels of fellow former First Lady Michelle Obama's recent piece in the New York Times demanding full prosecution of whatever morally bankrupt political official permitted ICE to continue growing increasingly unaccountable and sadistic throughout the early 2010s.

'We're not just talking about immigration hardliners here, either'Dean Heller, John McCain, Susan Collins, and even Joe Manchin all gave me their endorsement. These senators were certainly aware of what actions I was likely to take as Attorney General, so why would they have decided to confirm me if these policies were unjust?

'This isn't just someone who made a few mistakes'whether it was laundering Ukrainian money through Trump properties in the early '90s or violating campaign finance laws to benefit Trump during the 2016 election, Cohen has proven time and again that he is an inveterate liar and scofflaw. And these are only the crimes we know that he carried out for Trump. In the weeks ahead, we expect many more illegal practices to surface, which will only confirm Michael Cohen's complete lack of morality.'

'These rules endanger voters by significantly increasing the likelihood of a claw popping out of the slot and latching onto an unsuspecting Mainer,' said Common Cause spokesperson Regina Watson, adding that the state's volunteer poll workers had been grossly unprepared for the massive uptick in finger lacerations already occurring under the new procedure. 'We have predicted rampant median and ulnar nerve damage across all voting precincts, as well as hundreds, if not thousands, of completely severed fingers. If this system isn't fixed going forward, there's a real chance these crustaceans will end up in electronic voting machines, where they can smash through the screens and violently squeeze the appendages of Americans simply trying to exercise their constitutional rights.'

'There was some negotiating involved in getting [Jong-un] to buy as many nukes as we wanted to sell, but by cutting the price, we came out with a deal that's profitable for America and therefore good for the world,' said Trump of the pact, which requires the United States to provide the East Asian authoritarian state with 50 thermonuclear fusion weapons over the next five years. 'We're taking this $10 billion and investing it right back into our economy, our arms industry, and especially our great military, because now more than ever we're going to need them to help train, supply, and reinforce North Korean troops.'

'I think I speak for all first-world leaders when I state our fervent wish that Kim Jong-un pledges to denuclearize so we don't have to give a shit about North Korea or its people ever again,' said French president Emmanuel Macron, adding that the leaders looked forward to the day when North Korea would just be some unthreatening, easily ignorable country with lots of suffering on the level of Eritrea, Cambodia, or the Ivory Coast. 'For far too long, North Korea has been able to remain in the spotlight among world nations because its nuclear program poses a potential danger, and it is long past time for it to become one of the many also-ran nations with rampant poverty and widespread human rights abuses that we don't need to mention much, like, say, Laos or Guinea Bissau. If Trump is able to get Kim to agree to denuclearize, it will be a truly monumental step in our efforts to avoid having to ever consider what life is like in poor nations.'

'I kid you not, this guy was prepared to bow down and kiss Trump's boots like some cigar-chomping numbskull who actually thought he had a chance at being Attorney General.

'Manafort has a death wish. He just wants to ride to glory. Don't bother looking for him. He's not coming back.' Sources confirmed that the drenched special counsel watched for a long moment after Manafort's board disappeared below the churning water and then left the beach by himself, pausing only to toss his badge into the foaming shallows."
