1,Self-Loathing GOP Congressman Can't Believe He's Been Reduced To Defending Necessity Of Public Schools,"WASHINGTON'As the nation falls deeper into the grip of a pandemic that has forced compromises upon his most cherished principles, a self-loathing Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN) acknowledged Friday he could not believe he had been reduced to defending the necessity of public schools in a civil society. 'I hear these words coming out of my mouth, these requests for more federal dollars so public schools can reopen, and I wonder, 'My God, what have I become?'' said Alexander, who wondered aloud whether he might still be able to console himself by diverting money from lunch programs and using it to build more charter schools. 'I can barely recognize myself anymore, this man who goes on television and talks about how a return to normalcy in American life depends upon increasing funds to public schools and ensuring they have everything they need to succeed. Ugh, how has it come to this? Has the half century I've spent in politics been a complete waste?' At press time, Alexander had reportedly cheered himself up by thinking about all the public school teachers and staff whose health would be threatened by reopening too soon."

Eliot Engel (D-NY), House Speaker Nancy Pelosi phoned Jamaal Bowman to scold him for winning his primary race, sources confirmed Wednesday. 'I just wanted to call and personally reprimand you for your victory,' said Pelosi, extending her sincerest indignation to the former Bronx middle school educator, who is expected to easily win the general election in his heavily Democratic congressional district. 'I understand there are some mail-in ballots that still need to be counted, but it appears you won big last night and energized a lot of first-time voters and young people we absolutely did not want voting in this primary. So allow me to extend my sincerest fuck-you for everything you've done. Obviously, we're going to be working together soon, so I look forward to crushing you the first chance I get.' Pelosi added that when things became official in November, she would call again to express how frustrated she was to welcome Bowman to Congress."

'We have seen people around this nation calling for dramatic change, and I can assure you that we intend to meet this moment with the support it deserves'a nice memorial, say, or perhaps a national day of remembrance that individual states can decide to declare an official day off work if they want,' said Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), echoing a bipartisan group of representatives that if these solutions were not acceptable to leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement, Congress was also willing to consider painting a mural. 'Whether it's one fairly prominent statue of a black person and white person holding hands in D.C. or several smaller ones in cities nationwide, we in Congress are committed to acknowledging the validity and importance of the Black Lives Matter movement. We will make sure that your voices are heard in small script on the bottom of federal calendars or in a bronze statue in some D.C. park.' At press time, Congress announced that it was also open to sending all Black Lives Matter movement leaders cupcakes. "
5,Democratic Leaders Announce That They've Learned The Words 'Systemic Racism',"WASHINGTON'Democratic leaders announced Wednesday that they have learned the words 'systemic racism' and that they were very excited to have done so. 'We have been informed of the phrase 'systemic racism,' and, beyond that, we plan to use it in several sentences,' said Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in an impromptu press conference that also included House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and DNC Chair Tom Perez, who all echoed the fact that they have seen these two words next to each other on a sheet of paper given to them by aides, have read that sheet of paper, and will proceed to repeat those words both in conversation amongst themselves and with reporters. 'We understand that it is a phrase, and we will include this phrase in sentences we speak. In fact, you might see us on television using this set of words very soon. All of this is to say that today, we have discovered two new words that we are supposed to use. That's all.' At press time, the Democratic Party had announced a bold new initiative to combat systematic rhotacism in 2020. Here's a list of organizations where you can donate."
6,"She Needs A Bible Now, Fuckwad'Yes, It's For An Epic Clapback!' Yells Panicked Pelosi Aide Into Phone","WASHINGTON'Following reports that Donald Trump sprayed tear gas at protestors and members of the clergy before a photo-op at St. John's Church, a panicked aide to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi reportedly picked up the phone Tuesday and yelled 'she needs a Bible now, fuckwad'yes, it's for an epic clapback.' 'Look, I don't care how you get it, but get it now, because the clapback queen needed a photo of her in a pink pantsuit, reading a bible on Twitter, Facebook, and the front page of CNN five fucking minutes ago,' said the hoarse, screaming aide, who then added that if she didn't see a holy text within the next 10 minutes, 'your ass will never work in Washington, D.C. again.' 'Listen, you little bitch, I don't care if it's the middle of a global pandemic, and I don't give a shit if every bookstore is closed'this is the voice of a generation, so you will rob a fucking church if you have to, do you understand? This is going to be a fucking epic-Trump-takedown-iconic-girlpower-slam. Now hurry the fuck up. Before I end you.' At press time, the aide had slammed down the phone only to pick it up 30 seconds later and yell, 'Oh yeah, and refill the Jeni's ice cream in the fridge, or I'll rip off your head and feed it to her fucking dog.' Here's a list of organizations where you can donate."
7,"DNC To Streamline Fundraising By Cutting Out Unnecessary Cost Of Campaigns, Candidates","WASHINGTON'In a letter to top donors explaining how their contributions would now be spent more efficiently than ever, the Democratic National Committee announced plans Tuesday to streamline its fundraising by completely eliminating the unnecessary costs of campaigns and candidates. 'We're confident that once our party is freed from the burden of putting forth nominees and running expensive campaigns, we'll finally be able to focus all our efforts on generating as much revenue as possible,' wrote DNC chairman Tom Perez, adding that he hoped an upcoming series of fundraisers to which the letter's recipients were invited would help pay for even bigger fundraisers down the line. 'So just go online, make your donation, and we'll take it from there. Whether you're able to give $5 a month or cut us a check for the annual maximum of $35,500, we promise to take that money and put it toward making even more money. We're confident that with no candidates or platforms to disagree on, Democrats of every stripe will unite to give us the financial support we've always wanted. Together, we can do this.' At press time, reports confirmed Perez was threatening to disburse all cash on hand to President Trump's reelection campaign if donors failed to reach the DNC's spring fundraising goal."
8,Pros And Cons Of Voting By Mail,"Long-term social isolation plans due to the coronavirus pandemic have shined the spotlight on voting by mail for the remaining primaries and even the November elections, a process that is already used in some states but has its share of critics. The Onion looks at the pros and cons of voting by mail. Furiously research ballot measures at last minute from comfort of your own home Delicious adhesive on envelope Creates nice, tidy piles of mail-in ballots to be conveniently lost somewhere No need to rent tux Potential several-day delay before being let down by outcome Walk to mailbox a real drag Eliminates only plausible excuse for loitering at middle school Candidates still fucking awful Unclear if USPS can handle huge responsibility right in middle of getting dismantled Risks easily facilitating nation's participation in democracy"

10,Biden Campaign Considering Using The Internet To Attract Voters,"PHILADELPHIA'Saying it was definitely something they were looking into, officials with Joe Biden's presidential campaign confirmed to reporters Wednesday they were actively exploring the possibility of using the internet to attract voters. 'We may use it, we may not, but yes, it is one of the outreach tools on our radar at this time,' said Biden 2020 co-chair Cedric Richmond, adding that the campaign 'didn't want to get ahead of itself,' but if surveys showed there was a sizable block of registered voters using the technology, it might eventually hire two or three staffers to work on the internet full-time. 'It's pretty cutting-edge stuff. The web can send text and images right to people's computer screens, so it may actually turn out to be an effective means of spreading the vice president's message. And who knows, there might even be a way to raise money through the internet. We'll be conducting more research into the matter as soon as we install the free trial disk we have in our files.' At press time, the Biden campaign had reportedly published a single standard-definition photo of the presumptive Democratic nominee on a Blogger account set to private."
11,Nancy Pelosi Assures Democratic Reps They Don't Need To Try Being Productive During Stressful Pandemic,"WASHINGTON'Encouraging lawmakers to avoid holding themselves to the impossible standard of protecting Americans, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) assured Democratic House representatives Wednesday they don't need to try being productive during the stressful pandemic. 'These uncertain times are difficult for everyone, so don't feel like you need to push yourself to constantly come up with detailed plans to avert a new depression,' said Pelosi, insisting that House Democrats should tune out the nagging voice of constituents pressuring them to ease mass suffering by enacting essential social safety measures before it's too late. 'Don't create a bunch of tension in your life by attempting to secure aid to unemployed Americans struggling to pay for basic necessities. Supporting workers is not going to happen anyway, so don't get all stressed. Look, this is not the time to beat yourself up over whether you're doing enough to prevent a cataclysmic economic decline. Take a breather. Sometimes it's better to just plop down on the couch and watch movies all day.' At press time, Pelosi emphasized there would be plenty of time to work on enacting legislation after the pandemic was finished cratering every aspect of American life."

'Well, you see Prime Minister, because of your severe respiratory issues, we, um, actually needed to access that part of your head for a...surgery thing, yes,' said senior clinician Dr. Randal Jensen, taking long, awkward pauses as he looked between his medical charts and Johnson's new head of short, well-coiffed hair. 'Simply put, if we had kept your hairstyle the way it was, you could have risked death or something else, probably. We believe this is because the uh...keratin in your hair is related to your lungs, but don't worry too much about that right now. We actually do it to all our patients. Right, yes, we definitely do that.' At press time, the prime minister had reportedly informed his medical team that after his emergency lifesaving haircut, he'd never felt better. "

16,Senator Kelly Loeffler Asks For Prayers After Losing $3 On Single Stock Due To Coronavirus,"WASHINGTON'Begging her constituents to keep her family in their thoughts in the coming days, Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) asked for Americans to send her prayers in an emotional press conference Tuesday in which she announced that she had lost as much as $3 on a single stock due to the coronavirus. 'I am asking for all of your support in helping me through this difficult time, a time of incalculable financial loss that I hope none of you have to experience,' said the junior Georgia senator, often straining to hold back tears as she told reporters that she and her husband would be spending the coming weeks speaking with financial advisors about how to make sense of this unimaginable fiscal hardship. 'You tell yourself something like this can never happen to you, you pretend you're immune to the terrible effects of this pandemic, but then you check in with your investment advisor and the news is almost too much to bear. Three dollars. Gone forever. When Jeffery and I found out, we cried for hours. I'll never forget the memory of my beloved stock's market value. May God protect the rest of our portfolios during this challenging time.' At press time, Loeffler had started a GoFundMe to recoup the loss and raised over $90,000 in the first few minutes."
17,Georgia Governor Argues That Closing State's Beaches An Attack On Citizens' Fundamental Right To Get Wet 'N' Wild,"ATLANTA'With public health experts decrying his decision last week to reopen the state's beaches, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp argued Monday that any government action limiting fun in the sun would constitute an infringement upon every citizen's fundamental right to get wet 'n' wild. 'Our forefathers fought and died to ensure future generations of Americans could enjoy certain God-given freedoms, among them the ability to head on down to the beach anytime one likes and have a splish-splashin' good time in the waves,' said Kemp, adding that he had no doubt the American colonists' decision to secede from Great Britain stemmed in part from concerns over whether the crown would continue to guarantee them unfettered access to sunshine, sand, and surf all summer long. 'If we cannot throw on a pair of trunks, wax down our boards, and shred those waves; if we cannot slip on some shades and work on our tans; if girls in bikinis cannot play a simple game of beach volleyball in the sizzlin' hot sun, then who are we, as a people? My God, 'from sea to shining sea''it's right there in the Declaration of Independence.' Kemp went on to state that Georgia's owners of beachfront property were exempt from his order and welcome to continue trammeling upon people's right to enjoy the ocean."
18,Trump Admits 18 New States To Increase Competition For Medical Supplies,"WASHINGTON'In an effort to attract better offers from governors forced into bidding wars over life-saving equipment, President Donald Trump admitted 18 new states Monday to increase competition for medical supplies. 'The free market works best with some healthy competition, so by increasing the number of U.S. states to 68, we can hopefully double the cost of ventilators,' said Trump, who noted that American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Midway Atoll, Toronto, and Tijuana were among the 18 territories that had been fast-tracked into the Union. 'It's important our manufacturers are getting the best prices possible. We're sending 300,000 surgical masks to a new state in the middle of Maine we're calling Clovis. Nobody lives there, but it's going to help drive up demand. The Coral Princess cruise ship is also now a state, a beautiful floating place, and they're looking for PPE, too. We don't have enough for them, but we're looking forward to their bids.' At press time, Trump clarified Puerto Rico would remain an unincorporated territory. "
19,Southern Governors Argue Covid-19 Good Christian Virus That Wouldn't Dare Spread During Church,"TALLAHASSEE, FL'In a bold affirmation of faith during a time of widespread global pandemic, the governors of several Southern states confirmed Thursday they have exempted religious services from their shelter-in-place orders, arguing that Covid-19 is a good Christian virus that wouldn't dare to spread during church. 'As far as I can tell, this coronavirus is an upstanding and righteous disease that knows better than to continue its deadly outbreak within a house of God,' Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said in a statement later echoed by Govs. Bill Lee of Tennessee, Greg Abbott of Texas, and Tate Reeves of Mississippi. 'If we were talking about some sort of secular, atheistic virus, churchgoers might have cause for worry. But I believe in my heart this highly communicable pathogen will show respect during services and not do anything to harm the Lord's flock on our day of rest. Now, what the virus does to the wicked, sinful people in our community'that's between it and God.' At press time, sources confirmed Southern governors had taken steps to ensure all mosques would be closed indefinitely."
20,Jared Kushner Says States Should Have Planned Ahead Before Joining The Union,"WASHINGTON'Speaking at a press conference to address the growing Covid-19 pandemic, White House senior advisor Jared Kushner admonished resource-stricken states this week that they should have shown some foresight and planned ahead before joining the Union. 'To any governors coming to me and saying the White House hasn't given them what they need, I would urge them to ask why they didn't consider these possibilities centuries ago when they first joined together into a federal republic?' said Kushner, singling out Texas' governor in particular and questioning why the Lone Star state didn't simply start stockpiling their own ventilators or face masks back in 1884 when they allowed the United States to annex them from Mexico.''Some of you, like Massachusetts or Virginia, have actually had several hundred years with the knowledge that our Constitution grants significant independence in resource allocation to individual states. Frankly, you could have decided way back in 1776 that this setup wasn't for you. Instead, you impulsively formed a unified nation without even considering the consequences. I'm sorry if I don't sympathize here.' Kushner stressed that he was tired of hearing excuses from states that didn't begin building a respirator cache in the 18th century because they were busy with westward expansion or that modern germ theory simply had not yet been developed."

22,Trump Tackles Medical Supply Shortage By Awarding ExxonMobil Contract To Drill For Ventilators In Arctic,"WASHINGTON'Saying there was no way the coronavirus could win with such amazing corporations on their side, President Donald Trump kicked off his plan to tackle the medical supply shortage Tuesday by awarding ExxonMobil an exclusive contract to drill for ventilators in the arctic. 'Today, the heroic crews at ExxonMobil will travel to Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, where they will drill 6,000 feet below the earth in search of new, undiscovered mechanical breathing devices,' said Trump, signing the $86 billion deal that gave the oil company sole access to survey, drill, and extract from over 30,000 square miles of 'vast, untapped reservoirs of respiratory ventilators.' 'While this crisis is a challenge, I want to assure the American people that there are millions of medical devices lying just below the arctic surface, and all we need is ExxonMobil's vast network of drilling rigs to find them. That's why we're also announcing the construction of a long-distance ventilator pipeline, as well as an exclusive, multi-billion-dollar contract with Shell to begin extracting ventilators on Native American reservations throughout South Dakota.' At press time, President Trump had reportedly once again downplayed the need for medical supplies after one of ExxonMobil's largest offshore tankers exploded. "
23,Trump Delays Easter To July 15 To Keep Promise On Coronavirus,
24,Trump Announces Plan To Retrain Nation's 3 Million Unemployed Americans As Human Ventilators,"WASHINGTON'Taking drastic action to address the country's critical medical supply shortages as well as rising jobless claims, President Donald Trump announced a plan Friday to retrain the nation's 3 million unemployed Americans to work as human ventilators. 'We're going to put Americans back to work by teaching them to lock lips with infected coronavirus patients and pump air into and out of their lungs,' said Trump, who explained how the Department of Labor would be giving all out-of-work Americans an opportunity to take an accelerated training course to learn how to successfully provide ventilatory assistance to Covid-19 patients with their mouths. 'States asked for help, and we've listened. This is going to save hundreds, potentially thousands of lives, and put our nation's great service workers back on their feet. There are thousands of very, very sick people waiting across the country with their mouths gaping open.' At press time, Trump told reporters that if unemployment numbers continue to rise, that many of the jobless could take on roles as hospital beds."
25,What's In Congress' Coronavirus Stimulus Bill,"After days of frenzied negotiations, Congress passed a $2 trillion stimulus package to address economic issues caused by the coronavirus, the largest such aid package in U.S. history. The Onion takes a look at what's in the stimulus bill. Direct payments of $1,200 for single Americans, $2,400 for married couples, and $3,000 for those playing the field. $32 billion to an airline industry that charged you for a blanket on your last flight. Paywall taken off U.S. Unemployment Office website. More protections than you'd think necessary to safeguard American people from their president. Lot of money the government has spent decades telling Americans it didn't have and couldn't spend. Probably something that sounds very good and turns out to be very bad. Five dollars to Senator Ron Johnson for winning betting pool that Rand Paul would get virus first. Every family will receive $500 per child, but officials may not come to collect the children until May. Federal aid for independent contractors, such as Uber drivers and assassins. A stern reminder that this is a one-time thing."
26,"Congress Sets Aside $1,200 In Trust For Each American Until They Prove They're Responsible Enough To Handle It","WASHINGTON'Following days of partisan gridlock over its emergency economic stimulus plan, Congress announced sweeping new legislation Wednesday that would place $1,200 into trust funds for each individual American until they have proved they're actually responsible enough to handle it. 'We've given this a lot of thought and decided that instead of mailing out checks, we will put this money into 330 million separate accounts that you'll be able to access when you're a little bit older and can show you've developed some real maturity,' Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) said as he sought to assure the nation that one day the U.S. populace would thank both houses of Congress for choosing to handle its historic $2 trillion relief plan in this way. 'Now, don't look so glum. We know you want to have it now, but it took us quite a bit of negotiating to get this money together, and we want to make sure you aren't just going to run out and blow it all on a bunch of stuff you don't need. So, keep your nose out of trouble, and one day this fund will be there waiting for you when you want it for something really important.' At press time, Grassley explained how multinational corporation Boeing could receive money from the federal government anytime it wanted because it had already won over lawmakers by generously spending so much money since its last bailout on donations to congressional campaigns."

28,Trump Suggests Ceding New York To Coronavirus As Possible Appeasement Strategy,"WASHINGTON'Mulling solutions to stop the disease's rapid spread across the country, President Donald Trump reportedly suggested Tuesday ceding New York to the coronavirus as a possible appeasement strategy. 'We are committed to looking at all options as we work through the invasion of this virus on our shores, including ceding at least the city of New York and potentially the entire state in order to meet the virus halfway and spare the rest of America from further suffering,' said Trump at a press conference, adding that his understanding of what the coronavirus wanted led him to believe that New York's 54,000 square miles and nearly 20 million residents would be sufficient to placate the respiratory disease. 'We're not in a good situation right now, but I think we can find a solution that will make me happy, make the American people happy, and make the virus happy. This is a win-win and everyone gets what they want. This is a big, big change, but in the end we're going to like the final result. I think this is a sacrifice everyone is willing to make. The virus should know that we respect where it's coming from and how dangerous it is, which is why we're offering a very big state. This is a very smart virus and it will know a good deal. I'd take this deal if I were the virus. Some of my advisors suggested Rhode Island or New Hampshire, but I know that won't be enough. We're hoping the coronavirus will be reasonable. We're hoping that if we give the coronavirus New York that will be enough and it will go back to China or Italy or wherever it came from. Maybe we'll throw in New Jersey as well.' New York governor Andrew Cuomo said he was willing to work with Trump but that ceding the entire state to the coronavirus was too much, and asked if he could reduce the offering to just the state's prisons and migrant detention centers."
29,Trump Urges Loosening CDC Restrictions To Let Coronavirus Get To Work,"WASHINGTON'Calling for an end to precautions such as social distancing and shelter-in-place mandates, President Donald Trump urged the loosening of CDC restrictions Tuesday to let Covid-19 get to work. 'The economy is hurting'we must send the coronavirus back into our office buildings, schools, and factories,' said Trump, explaining that the nation cannot risk the possibility of the number of new cases and deaths crashing. 'We need those numbers up! This is America, and work is important here. Without work, the virus has no purpose. Right now, there are millions of virus particles just sitting around and doing nothing. The coronavirus wants to work, so we're going to put it back to work as soon as possible.' At press time, the Dow had skyrocketed as the coronavirus returned in full strength back into the American workforce."
30,GOP Urges End Of Quarantine For Lifeless Bipedal Automatons That Make Economy Go,"WASHINGTON'In an effort to contain the disastrous financial fallout resulting from the spread of Covid-19, economic advisor Larry Kudlow joined numerous GOP leaders Monday in urging an end of self-quarantine for the lifeless bipedal automatons that make the economy go. 'We can't allow this virus to completely upend American life, so we are recommending that these soulless humanoid contraptions return to powering the country as soon as possible,' said Kudlow, noting that the upright, unthinking facsimiles needed to return to their primary function of lifting GDP and improving the stock market. 'We believe this group of insentient golems to be relatively low-risk due to their lack of a respiratory system, and right now, they're just gathering dust being stuck in their storage containers. Of course, we continue to recommend extreme caution and social distancing for any actual humans who may come into contact with these unthinking, unfeeling entities.' Ludlow added that to be extra cautious, any automatons who felt unwell should power down for the next two to three weeks."
31,Richard Burr Wondering When Profiting Off Mass Suffering Suddenly Became A Crime In This Country,"WASHINGTON'Admitting he was blindsided by the hysterical reaction to a pretty normal transaction, North Carolina Senator Richard Burr wondered Friday when profiting off mass suffering had suddenly become a crime in this country. 'Jesus Christ, when did everyone get so uptight about this? I remember when we used to celebrate people who used their talent and connections to get rich from death and anguish,' said Burr, who claimed what he did was no different than what many successful, patriotic Americans have been doing for hundreds of years. 'Even Tucker Carlson is being a little bitch about this. What's the big deal? Didn't we all decide this was cool in the 2008 recession? Last time I checked, using sensitive information to enrich yourself at the expense of hundreds of millions of other people was totally fine. I talked to Kelly [Loeffler] and Ron [Johnson] about cashing out, and nobody even batted an eye. What's the point of being a senator if you can't profit off the world's problems? I'm making money, not losing it, but I guess jealous people have decided that becoming rich and powerful from a national tragedy is suddenly evil. There's something seriously wrong with this country.' At press time, Burr announced his intentions to resign after shamefully admitting he only pulled in a 22% return from his insider trading."
32,Trump Administration Releases Best Case Scenario Projections For Coronavirus Where 8 Million Iranian People Die,"WASHINGTON'Striking an optimistic note in his daily press briefing about the global pandemic, President Donald Trump spoke to reporters Thursday, detailing his administration's best case scenario projections for coronavirus where eight million Iranian people are killed. 'If we're very lucky, we could be looking at many millions of dead Iranians, which is why we must do everything in our power to act,' said Trump, confirming that the U.S. government would be pouring resources into continued sanctions and military action against Iran to boost those numbers. 'We're taking this very seriously and monitoring the situation at all times, and we're hopeful that we could hit this target, or maybe even go past it, but the reality is, this is just a projection and it could tragically be as low as three or four million. We need help from every sector to make sure these citizens are unable to receive medical assistance and continue dying in the street.' When pressed by reporters, Trump acknowledged that the time had come to confront the ugly reality that at least some Iranians would survive."
33,Trump Seeks To Stimulate Economy By Sending Rare Autographed Photo To Every American,"WASHINGTON'With markets plummeting and many workers losing jobs as the coronavirus pandemic wreaks havoc on businesses, President Donald Trump announced Thursday a plan to stimulate the economy by sending a rare autographed 8-by-10-inch glossy photograph of himself to every U.S. resident. 'We know people are hurting financially, so in order to assist them at this critical time, I will be sending out these exclusive and very high-quality signed Donald J. Trump headshots to every American,' said the president, explaining that the approximately 330 million recipients of the exclusive collector's items could sell them for a hefty sum and then use the cash to cover rent, groceries, and medical bills, which would, in turn, pump billions of dollars back into the economy. 'Look, I'm a pretty well-known guy, so these things should definitely fetch a nice price and be a huge help to our workers, sustaining them through a difficult moment in our country's history. All we ask is that you do choose to sell them and spend the money now, for the sake of the economy, rather than holding on to these beautiful, limited-edition keepsakes as they inevitably appreciate in value. This is truly the stimulus we've all been waiting for.' At press time, critics had assailed Trump for exploiting a loophole in the new plan that allows him to send large corporations hundreds of thousands of extra autographed photos of himself."
34,Triumphant Jared Kushner Announces Plan To Move CDC Headquarters To Jerusalem,"WASHINGTON'Celebrating his own ingenuity in the face of the Covid-19 outbreak, President Donald Trump's senior advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner triumphantly announced his new plan Thursday to move the Centers for Disease Control headquarters to Jerusalem. 'The dire situation with the coronavirus demands bold solutions, and the time is now to move the CDC headquarters thousands of miles across the Atlantic,' said Kushner, gesturing to a map of the West Bank and indicating that a Palestinian neighborhood would need to be paved over to begin construction on the state-of-the-art facility. 'While all operations will be delayed for a few months so we can get started, once everything is up and running, we'll be able to address this pandemic from one of the world's most historically significant cities. We're taking the world's best doctors, scientists, epidemiologists, and immunologists to an entirely different continent to solve this global crisis. Finally, we'll be able to streamline collaboration between the CDC and the U.S. Israeli Embassy.' At press time, Kushner announced further plans to build strip clubs on Jerusalem's holy sites for CDC employees who may be homesick for Atlanta."
35,"Trump Quietly Checks With Aides To Make Sure He'd Be Included In Receiving $1,000 Government Checks","WASHINGTON'As his administration makes plans to combat the economic damage caused by the coronavirus with direct payments to Americans, President Donald Trump reportedly conferred with aides behind closed doors Wednesday to confirm he would be among those citizens receiving a pair of $1,000 checks. 'Hey, I'm also getting in on this deal, right?' Trump reportedly said to a White House economic strategist he had pulled aside, asking him to double-check the list of recipients and make sure he was on there, since he was 'an American too, after all,' and it was 'only fair' he receive the same assistance as everyone else. 'How soon are these things coming? Can we expedite them? An extra couple grand would be nice right about now. I should get my check first because I'm president and I've been working hard. Everyone else should get theirs after me. Maybe we could have a televised ceremony where I receive the check. That would boost morale, especially if I got a little more money than everybody else. Also, my kids are going to get them too, right? Is there any way those ones could just be forwarded directly to me?' At press time, sources reported that Trump increased the proposed amount of money Americans would be receiving to $2,687 after learning that taxes would have to be taken out."
36,Conservative Worries Relief Checks Would Discourage Americans From Providing For Selves By Killing Him And Taking His Property,"NEW HAVEN, CT'Speaking out against proposals to provide federal assistance to Americans hardest hit by the pandemic-fueled economic downturn, local conservative Mark Garrett expressed worry Wednesday that relief checks would discourage citizens from learning to provide for themselves by killing him and taking his property. 'People in this country should have enough self-reliance to stand on their own two feet, bust down my door, cut my throat, and seize all of my possessions,' said Garrett, adding that in America, there are plenty of profits to be had by anyone motivated enough to just go out there and forcibly take them. 'There's a real moral hazard here: When you pay people for doing nothing, it rewards them for being too irresponsible to look at all the wealth I've accumulated and realize that if they simply kidnapped my family and held them for ransom, I would eagerly pay it. A resourceful person wouldn't even need a gun, not if they were enterprising enough to come at me with a knife, an ax, or a tire iron. At the end of the day, if you're not willing to murder me while I'm asleep in bed and pocket all my valuables, you're not willing to work.' Garrett went on to ask why federal funds couldn't instead be given to the national guard, which would need to be sent in to impose martial law when the peasants began to riot."
37,Congress Allocates $2 Trillion To Bail Out Struggling Bailout Industry,"WASHINGTON'In order to alleviate the heavy damage the crucial financial sector is facing in the midst of the ongoing Covid-19 outbreak, the United States Congress announced Tuesday that they would be allocating $2 trillion in order to bail out the struggling bailout industry. 'The bailout industry is on the brink of failure, so in order to prevent a full-on catastrophe, we are setting aside $2 trillion in order to bail it out,' said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), adding that the business of giving of massive sums of money to corporations so they can cover their losses is at the very bedrock of the U.S. economic system, and without assistance, the entire bailout industry as we know it could collapse, which could lead to another Great Depression. 'During a crisis like this, the bailout industry is often hit the hardest, so we are taking immediate action, as our economy is deeply dependent on the bailout system; if bailouts can't function, then America can't function. A cash injection is absolutely necessary to make sure these failing businesses can inject cash into failing businesses.' At press time, Congress had signed a bill to allocate funds to bail out their bailout of the bailout industry."
38,Biden Pledges To Select Woman As Vice President Since Position Doesn't Entail Much Anyway,"WASHINGTON'In a bid to secure support for his nomination as the Democratic Party's candidate for president, Joe Biden reportedly pledged Sunday to select a woman as vice president since the position doesn't entail much anyway. 'I promise that my vice president will be a woman, since pretty much anyone can do this job, so I figure, hey, might as well pick a lady,' said Biden, adding that he knew from experience in his eight years as U.S. vice president that the position was essentially ceremonial and required no real work, so he had no reservations about handing it to a woman. 'You basically just sit on your can all day and maybe show up at a meeting every month or two, so if a woman wants to do that, be my guest. I could see myself selecting [Senator] Amy Klobuchar, [former Georgia State Rep.] Stacey Abrams, or any one of the tens of millions of women perfectly capable of pulling off this no-show gig. I don't really care what her politics are, and anyway it hardly matters. This works out well, actually, since I can stick a lady in the VP spot and don't have to put one in an important role on the cabinet.' At press time, Biden was being praised by members of the media and his own party for his commitment to symbolic representation in an office that most people forget about half the time."

'I don't get why I'm being slammed by all these cable news commentators and opinion columnists who, if they were put in charge of a pandemic by a powerful family member, would smugly assume they knew exactly what to do too,' said the senior adviser to the president, who explained he was especially hurt to see so many of his fellow Harvard University alumni denouncing one of their own. 'You guys are acting all holier-than-thou, but if your father-in-law were president of the United States instead of a board member at some media conglomerate, you'd choose to work in the West Wing, too. Just fucking admit it.' Kushner added that this went for 'all the little hypocrites' at Fox News too, who he claimed were also judging him, even if they were afraid to say it out loud."

'I just got off the phone with 911, they are aware of the situation, and we'll soon have this thing taken care of,' the commander-in-chief said during a televised address on Covid-19, urging all 330 million Americans not to worry because emergency response personnel should be arriving to assist them any minute now. 'I made sure to tell the operator this thing was important, and she agreed with me. So everyone should just relax and wait for them. They can send the fire department and the ambulance or both, and then they can probably give you a flu shot or something like that. It's good. We're in good shape.' At press time, White House sources confirmed the president had dialed 911 again to tell them that everything was actually fine and the nation didn't need their help at all."

44,Biden Extends Olive Branch To Biden Supporters,"PHILADELPHIA'In a largely measured speech calling for party unity after a string of primary victories, former Vice President Joe Biden took to the stage Tuesday night to extend an olive branch to Biden supporters. 'I appreciate the enthusiasm and energy of Joe Biden's voters, and I want any of his supporters who feel lost or counted out to know that there is a place for them with my campaign,' said Biden, stressing that while he and the vice president did not see eye to eye on every issue, they both shared values that represented a bold new vision for the American people. 'Of course, I might have occasionally clashed with Joe Biden in the more strained moments of recent debates, but we also worked together for many years in the Senate. At the end of the day, whether you're a Biden supporter or a Biden supporter, we have the same goal, which is to get Trump out of the White House and replace him with Joe Biden.' At press time, pundits launched into fevered speculations that the candidate's speech could contain hints Joe Biden was mulling the choice to appoint Joe Biden as vice president."
45,Tulsi Gabbard Named Democratic Nominee After Discovery Of Obscure Rule That Grants Nomination To Whoever Wins 0.7% Of The Vote In Missouri,"WASHINGTON'Beating out her rivals with the help of a little-known technicality, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) was named the Democratic Party's nominee for president Wednesday after the discovery of an obscure rule that grants the nomination to whoever wins 0.7% of the vote in Missouri. 'We weren't expecting this, but after double-checking the party's rules, it appears we are obliged to select Tulsi Gabbard as our candidate in 2020,' said Democratic National Committee chair Tom Perez, shrugging his shoulders and pointing to a section of a crumbling, yellowed document that contains the esoteric bylaw. 'I know a lot of Democrats were probably wondering why she was still in the race. But last night, while cross-referencing an old rule book in preparation for the upcoming debate, we came across this forgotten section of our charter, and, well, it all checks out. I admit it was a pretty cunning strategy on her part. With 100% of precincts now reporting, it appears the congresswoman received exactly 0.7% of votes in the Missouri primary yesterday. And so the time has come for us to put aside our differences and unite behind the next president of the United States, Tulsi Gabbard.' Perez went on to apologize on behalf of his entire party for not awarding the Democratic nomination for president to Sen. Furnifold McLendel Simmons (D-NC) in 1920."

'Let's see, there's one for Bernie, one for Biden, one for Klobuchar, one for Buttigieg'and I'd better not forget Warren or Bloomberg or Deval Patrick or Tulsi, 'cause they're blue, too,' said McMaster, who frantically colored in the circle beside the first name on his form after noticing the candidate was a Democrat, and then did the same for the other 21 Democrats listed. 'I've never heard of Robby Wells or Rocky de la Fuente III, but if they're Democrats, they're getting a vote. Almost got 'em all! Wait, hold on'I don't see John Delaney or Kirsten Gillibrand on here. Am I supposed to write them in?' At press time, sources confirmed that McMaster had left all the down-ballot races blank."
47,Biden Gives Speech From South African Jail Cell Where He Still Imprisoned For Supporting Nelson Mandela,"JOHANNESBURG'Striding across the cement floor of his sparse confines, Joe Biden gave a speech Monday from the South African jail cell where he is still imprisoned for supporting Nelson Mandela. 'I have sacrificed a great deal'my freedom, my livelihood, and my safety'in my fight against apartheid, but it has all been worth it to help my great friend Nelson Mandela,' said the former Vice President, his gaunt frame pacing the 8-foot-by-7-foot cell that he has called home since he was arrested for visiting the revolutionary South African civil rights leader in the 1970s. 'Despite the fact that I have been unjustly incarcerated here in Africa for decades, I am dedicated to becoming the 46th president of the United States. The fact that I have already been able to serve as your VP and as a senator before that is a testament to what I can accomplish. No walls can contain my mind, and I promise that once I am released, we're going to the DNC and then on to the White House.' At press time, Biden assured reporters that even if Nelson Mandela does not become his running mate, he does expect an endorsement from the anti-apartheid hero to be forthcoming."
48,Key Priorities For Trump's Reelection Campaign,"President Donald Trump will receive the Republican Party's nomination for president, and his reelection campaign against his eventual Democratic challenger is already well underway. The Onion takes a look at the key priorities for Trump going into his reelection campaign. Remind voters of achievements from first 10 years in office. Renew broadly popular campaign tactics like humiliating Ted Cruz and his family. Just the right amount of God. Expand electoral map beyond GOP's usual voter-suppression strongholds. Appeal to immigrant communities by saying he was just kidding. Massive campaign of graft, nepotism, and conflicts of interest has worked so far. Check if anyone's compiled credible evidence of corruption to use against Joe Biden. Maintain steady flow of marginally related words during speeches. Tout ability to work across aisle with Democrats on raising defense budgets, hurting American workers, and confirming Supreme Court justices. Try not to take whole thing too seriously and just have fun with it."
49,Biden Defends Past Inappropriate Touching Of Women As Symptom Of Stuttering Hands,"DETROIT'Opening up about the lifelong struggle that has been a source of embarrassment and frustration, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden defended Thursday his record of inappropriately touching women as a symptom of his lifelong struggle with stuttering hands. 'Since my childhood, I've been burdened with this debilitating problem'anytime I wrap my hands around a woman's waist or give them a shoulder rub, it's because of a nervous medical tick,' said Biden, choking up while recounting how much his uncontrollable caressing of women's backs and touching of their faces have hurt him over the years. 'I was often too ashamed in the past to speak about it, but I know there's some teenager out there grabbing a classmate's ass who needs to know they are not alone. I've dealt with the misfortune of seeing my hands reach out and pull a woman uncomfortably close to me and the embarrassment of them mocking me and saying 'Stop doing that.' I've worked to get it under control, and I want my supporters to be confident that I will only occasionally be touching women over the course of the presidential campaign.' At press time, Biden was attributing his support of the Iraq war and opposition to school busing as the result of a challenging brain stutter."

'She's completely shameless'every time there's a hot new guy in his late 60s or early 70s, she's all over him,' law clerk Angela Young told reporters, adding that when Ginsburg was first introduced to Supreme Court intern David Kearney, she had smiled coyly at the gray-haired man and said in a husky voice, 'You can just call me Ruth, sweetheart.' 'The other day, I saw her sit on his desk and invite him to stop by her chambers sometime if he ever needs someone to show him the ropes. It's the same thing every term. She just can't help herself when there's a 67-year-old piece of ass around.' At press time, Ginsburg had reportedly stopped Kearney as he was leaving for the day and asked if he wouldn't mind staying late to help her with her briefs."

'When touring across America, I saw no city that had been more mistreated and dismissed by its local officials than South Bend. I promise you, I will work tirelessly to overturn the mistakes of the previous administration. We'll be destroying the river walk and the smart sewer system and ending the Commuters Trust'all wastes of taxpayer money. You deserve a mayor who doesn't abandon you to fly to other states that he has no chance of winning, or take time away from focusing on your welfare to criticize the intelligence of dedicated, experienced senators. Congratulations, South Bend, your eight-year nightmare is finally over.' At press time, Klobuchar's administration had convicted 80% of the city's black population."
52,Biden Wondering Where All This Support Was When He Still Had Functioning Brain,"WILMINGTON, DE'As the moderate wing of the Democratic Party consolidated its backing around his candidacy, former Vice President Joe Biden reportedly wondered Thursday where all this support was back when he still had a functioning brain. 'Here's the deal: I'm flattered that everyone's voting for me and the big Democratic donors are giving me a lot of money, but look, I used to have a general idea of what was happening, and it would've been nice if they'd shown me that kind of support back then,' said the former vice president, trailing off and staring blankly for a moment before telling reporters that he didn't win a single state when he ran for the party's nomination in either 1988 or 2008, when he would have been physically and cognitively prepared for the demands of running in a general election. 'I've been pandering to people and compromising progressive goals for decades, and now you're just throwing all this campaign support and money behind me? I was lucid for 70 years! I honestly can't figure you people out. Why are you just now saying Joe Biden should be president when I can't hold a train of thought for longer than 10 seconds or talk to anyone on the campaign trail without getting agitated and sticking my finger in their face? What is your deal?' Sources confirmed that Biden also wondered why the Democrats were supporting him now that he wouldn't be the only candidate in clear mental decline with a history of reactionary policies in the race."
53,Sanders Supporter Urges Importance Of Listening To Minority Voices Just Not Specifically The Ones Who Handed Victory To Biden,"DETROIT'Stressing the need for inclusivity and intersectionality in the 2020 Democratic primaries, local Bernie Sanders supporter Kevin Randall took to Facebook Wednesday to stress the importance of listening to minority voices, just not any of the ones that have handed victory to Joe Biden. 'We need to make clear that, with the exception of those who showed up in droves to vote for Biden in South Carolina and on Super Tuesday, our movement has room for all people of color,' wrote Randall, who explained that it's important to avoid becoming siloed within one's own narrow worldview and to empathize with Americans from every background who did not just make Biden the new frontrunner last night. 'Marginalized groups are being shut out of these conversations, so we need to take a moment to hear what, in particular, 18-to-35-year-old, college-educated, progressive black and Latino voters from western states have to say. They, along with the tiny minority of working-class citizens in disenfranchised minority communities who object to the moderate platform of Joe Biden, should not be made to feel invisible in our democracy.' Randall later added that it was also important to listen to older Jewish people, except for the ones who cast ballots for Mike Bloomberg."

'God damn it, I wish Mike could have given me a little heads up,' said Wilkonson, confirming her annoyance at having received the news about the former New York mayor suspending his campaign mere minutes after she returned to her office from the abortion clinic. 'He'd been dropping hints for weeks about how hard it would be for me to give this job my all if I was distracted with a child, so it would have been nice if he had thought to contact me about his plans before I went to all this trouble. It sucks too because I had been really looking forward to having this kid.' Wilkonson added that she felt especially aggravated knowing that she wouldn't be able to vent about her situation due to the non-disclosure agreements she'd been forced to sign."

'Democratic voters have spoken, they know that when it comes to the presidential election, I would be by far the most likely candidate to defeat Bernie Sanders,' said Biden, who cited his strength among a wide variety of demographic groups as proof he was the unity figure the party needs to fight back against the Democratic Socialists they would be facing in November. 'People know this election is the most important of our lifetime, and we need to nominate someone who can stop progressive policies in their tracks. In fact, if we harness that energy, I have no doubt we can deliver a resounding defeat to the entire Democratic party.' Biden ended his victory speech by claiming that if this momentum continued, the Democrats could be celebrating their biggest victory over their opponents ever at July's convention."

'We want to consolidate the process and cut down on red tape, so Democratic voters casting ballots in any of today's 14 primary races need to report to Pyron Elementary in Clarksville, AR before polls close at 7:30 p.m.,' said DNC chair Tom Perez, adding that voters from Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, and Virginia should check in at the table inside the auditorium, accessible from the school's north entrance, while those from American Samoa would be caucusing in the gym. 'Clarksville is centrally located in the middle of the country, which we hope most people will find convenient. We expect the line to stretch a good 20-30 miles long, but once you reach the voting booth, you'll be in and out'bang'in about 10 minutes. We encourage everyone to be patient, and I recommend bringing enough food and water to last several days. A folding chair probably wouldn't be a bad idea, either.' At press time, volunteers manning the Clarksville location confirmed that only two of the five voting machines were currently working."
58,Biden Confident After Spending Super Tuesday Stumping Across Iowa,"DES MOINES, IA'Expressing optimism about how the upcoming electoral contest would play out, presidential candidate Joe Biden was reportedly feeling confident about his chances this week after spending Super Tuesday stumping across Iowa. 'I've spent the last 24 hours crisscrossing the state to get people excited about the Biden campaign, and tonight all that hard work pays off,' said the former vice president, recalling the dozens of stops he'd made in towns like Dubuque and Mason City to hold rallies in school gyms and rec centers to urge Iowans to vote. 'I'm feeling really good about our chances here, especially since it seems like a lot of my rivals have completely given up on the state. You'd be amazed how shocked Hawkeyes are when they see me stopping into their local diner, and I think we're going to be able to translate that excitement into big numbers at the polls.' Biden added that he was hopeful his momentum from Iowa would propel him to a knock-out victory in New Hampshire."

'To run for president and sell these unworkable ideas of unity when I have no plans for actually achieving them is unfair to the American people,' said Buttigieg, who attacked his campaign as inflexible and alienating to anyone who did not agree with his narrow worldview of what the Democratic party should be. 'For me to step on stage and sell myself as president of the United States is just absurd. This election is too important for Americans to take a risk on this fantasy of a small city mayor who could magically transform politics. The disingenuous, ego-driven promises, soaring rhetoric, and lack of results are why people have grown sick of Washington, and why I should drop out of the presidential race.' At press time, Buttigieg had declined to endorse another candidate, noting that suggesting Democrats had any chance of winning in November would just be another empty promise."
61,Damning New Footage Shows Sanders In 1980s Arguing Madonna Could Never Make Transition From Music To Film,"NEW YORK'In a video from late 1984 that was circulating online Friday and could severely damage his bid for the presidency, Bernie Sanders can be heard openly questioning whether Madonna was likely to succeed in the transition from making records to acting in major motion pictures. 'Look, she's an undeniable pop sensation with a promising string of top-20 hits to her credit, but let me tell you something: There's no guarantee that kind of talent is going to translate to the silver screen,' Sanders, then mayor of Burlington, VT, says in a local public-access broadcast in which he clearly exhibits short-sightedness in his failure to anticipate the undeniable success the Material Girl would achieve in box-office smashes such as A League Of Their Own and Evita. 'Madonna should stick to music. People love this Like A Virgin album, it's a lot of fun to dance to, and she needs to build on its success. Taking time away from that to focus on what are sure to be small, insubstantial roles in lackluster films? That's career suicide.' Reminded by reporters that Madonna had won acclaim for her role in Desperately Seeking Susan just a few months after his videotaped remarks, a visibly angry Sanders argued that Rosanna Arquette had carried that entire film and anyone who said otherwise didn't know 'a goddamn thing' about acting."

'I'm running a legitimate campaign for the highest fucking office in the nation, carrying on the legacy of brave historical women who stood up to oppression and spoke truth to power, I'm not an excuse for you to create a lame-ass 'TeamWarren'-branded Etsy account,' said the Massachusetts senator sternly, adding that she was an 'actual human woman with legislative experience, not an adult Hermione motherfucking Granger.' 'Oh, you stitched 'Nevertheless she persisted' onto another damn pillow for your Instagram? Cute. By the way, have you ever heard of canvassing, or is the 'pussy hat' you wasted crucial primary outreach hours crocheting too snug around your ears? And, while we're on this, where are the profits from that deluge of enamel pins going? Certainly not to my campaign, last I checked.' At press time, Warren had punched through the glass of a framed poster featuring her head photoshopped onto Wonder Woman's body that her 'so-called supporters' had mailed to her campaign headquarters."

'Look, I don't want to toot my own horn here, but I'm a two-term president with significant pull among Democratic voters and I can't help but feel a little bummed that no campaign has even raised the question of whether I'd consider endorsing them,' said the 44th commander in chief, stressing that he would happily express his full-throated approval for Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders or any of the race's other candidates if they had even so much as broached the topic with him during recent in-person conversations, email chains, and phone calls. 'Especially Joe. I mean, I worked with the guy for eight years, and he hasn't even reached out to test the waters. I'm not trying to overstate my significance, but it's not crazy to think my vouching for what he did as vice president could really change the way this race shakes out, right? I mean, what the hell? I feel like a forgotten man over here.' At press time, the former president had sighed and started drafting an enthusiastic endorsement of Tulsi Gabbard after receiving a request from one of the representative's assistants."

69,Candidates Struggle To Answer Question About Future Of Granite Countertops During HGTV Town Hall,"CHARLESTON, SC'Clearly uncomfortable being asked to express their views on such a contentious issue, the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates struggled Wednesday to answer questions about the future of granite countertops during a series of HGTV town halls. 'As president, what are you going to do to address the fact that wages are stagnating to the point where the vast majority of Americans can't afford the granite countertops and backsplash tiles they desperately need to fix up their homes?' asked Jonathan Scott, who was moderating the HGTV town hall with his Property Brothers co-host Drew Scott, interrupting candidate Pete Buttigieg's stammering response to note that a majority of voters doubted the former South Bend, IN mayor could effectively unify angry members of the nation's polarized homeowners associations behind a common lawn care policy. 'How do you plan to address the millions of Americans making do with laminate countertops, or who are forced to live in homes where there's a lack of natural sunlight in the kitchen? Will you commit today to providing the support for all Americans to knock down a wall and open up the floor plan of their common areas? Many people out there are wondering whether their future will include a brick patio or detached deck, or whether they'll ever even be able to live in a place that is perfect for entertaining. How do you respond?' At press time, Senator Amy Klobuchar was being booed by the HGTV town hall audience after she doubled down on controversial previous statements criticizing crown molding. "

71,Sanders Supporter Sick Of Movement Being Defined By Small Number Of Toxic Members Like Him,"DENVER, CO'Stressing that his angry rants and unhinged perceptions of the world in no way represented the Vermont senator's broad coalition of supporters, 27-year-old Adam Patterson told reporters Wednesday that he was sick and tired of the Sanders movement being defined by a small number of toxic members like himself. 'Honestly, I'm just fed up with the mainstream media taking a tiny sample of aggressive and borderline unhinged Bernie supporters like me and suggesting that we somehow represent the millions of completely normal Bernie voters out there,' said Patterson, stressing that the condescending way that he insisted anyone who slightly critiqued Sanders or his plans was a neoliberal shill, white supremacist, or supporter of war criminals did not at all reflect Sanders' largely issues-oriented campaign. 'Look, clearly I'm a lunatic who has lost all touch with reality or historical context. I mean, I've repeatedly argued I'd rather live in Venezuela under Nicolas Maduro than the totalitarian state of America. That's crazy. And, frankly, I'm sure if Bernie saw me going online and telling women they were fucking corporatist bitches for supporting Warren, he would condemn it, because it distracts from his generally positive message. But I'm just one person. Should the media get to cast all Bernie supporters in a negative light just because of a few complete and utter assholes like me?' At press time, Patterson had decided that the best solution to the mischaracterization was to tell a female journalist who wrote about Bernie Sanders' history of praising left-wing dictatorships to get ovarian cancer and die."

'We have a full itinerary planned over the next few days in which will tour a variety of Washington cultural sites, newly built manufacturing facilities, and even the state-of-the-art Johns Hopkins Hospital, so the coronavirus can observe firsthand the best of American pride and ingenuity. We are excited to develop a stronger bond with such an influential force in the international community, and we hope that a strong partnership with the coronavirus could lead to further diplomatic relations with H1N1, SARS, and other prominent global viruses.' At press time, a Trump administration spokesperson announced a change to the diplomatic itinerary after the coronavirus had expressed an interest in touring the CDC director's lungs."

'Our first question is for Mayor Bloomberg: How will you respond to another two hours of the other nominees just completely wrecking your shit?' said CBS This Morning co-host Gayle King, citing the fact that the billionaire former New York City mayor had spent the debate six days earlier 'getting absolutely bodied' and wondered whether he had a plan to prevent 'a complete and total roasting' from happening again. 'Mr. Bloomberg, do you believe that you prepared this time, and is it going to be enough? Because from where we're sitting, you got ripped a new one last debate, and now you're about to be hit from every side. Honestly, after seeing how easy it was last time, we wouldn't be surprised if the other candidates are even better prepared to tear you apart. Tonight, the whole country is watching to see if you have any plan to avoid getting fucking hammered again. You ready?' Sources confirmed that fellow CBS moderator Norah O'Donnell then interjected and told Bloomberg that they would give him 30 seconds to run off the stage if he still wanted to save himself before it started."
75,Klobuchar Hoping To Distinguish Herself During Debate As Only Candidate Not Sucker Punched In Gut Moments Before Stepping On Stage,"CHARLESTON, SC'Stressing that the contrast between herself and her rivals could not be starker, presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar told viewers at Tuesday night's Democratic debate that she remained the only candidate who had not been sucker punched in the gut moments before stepping on stage. 'Tonight, I'm asking voters to really think about the distinct choice they're being offered between a heartland Democrat with a record of serious accomplishments and six other candidates who have spent this entire debate doubled over and collapsing in front of their podiums or wheezing for air,' said the Minnesota senator, pointing to her distinguished record of not getting absolutely clocked in the moments before a national television appearance before gesturing across the stage at a whimpering Bernie Sanders clutching his stomach as he rolled around in agony. 'Ask yourself, if Elizabeth Warren wasn't prepared to get slugged right in the breadbasket as she stepped into the spotlight, then do you really think she'll be ready for the presidency? Now you've seen what my fists are capable of this evening, and if you're ready for a different type of candidate'one who isn't whimpering and begging for mercy'then I promise you a place with me.' At press time, Klobuchar had torn into Michael Bloomberg's supposedly tough-on-crime record as the dry heaving former New York City mayor began to retch onto the debate floor."

'Has my career meant nothing? I feel so invisible,' said Kagan, gazing at her reflection in a mirror and questioning what it was her fellow female justices have that she herself lacks. 'I mean, I was solicitor general as well as dean of Harvard Law School and I thought that was impressive, but does that even really mean anything if the president isn't calling on me to recuse myself from cases involving him? This man should hate me, yet he hasn't said a word about me voting against his wealth test for immigrants, or any of my other rulings. Am I just a big phony?' At press time, Kagan was trying to comfort herself by considering that a mistaken Trump might think she was actually a Bush appointee."

'Although we may come from different worlds, and our civilizations are separated by millions of lightyears, the bonds we share are still incredibly powerful,' said Trump, who marveled aloud at the strange vegetation and peculiar culture of the foreign planet, remarking to aides that the inhabitants of India were 'a lot like us,' despite their extraterrestrial origin. 'When I landed here in my flying craft after a long journey at warp speed through multiple galaxies, your entire planet came out into the streets to welcome me as if I were a member of your own species. That's something I'll never forget. May our two countries continue to exist in interplanetary harmony, sending a message of peace to the rest of the universe.' Trump later complimented Indian prime minister Narendra Modi's efforts to combat the intergalactic Muslim threat that puts their shared star system in danger."
79,Embarrassed Heart Surgeon Admits He May Have Accidentally Left Sanders' Medical Records In Candidate's Chest,"LAS VEGAS'Acknowledging the blunder following public pressure that his patient release the confidential documents, embarrassed heart surgeon Dr. Michael Sharrer admitted to reporters Monday that he may have accidentally left Bernie Sanders' medical records in the candidate's chest. 'Honestly, I just set them down for a second, and before I knew it he was all closed up,' said Sharrer, who speculated that he must have misplaced the Vermont senator's health records inside Sanders' thoracic cavity while performing the stent procedure with the scalpel in one hand and the files in the other back in October. 'It was a manila folder filled with all kinds of test results and charts. It probably got tucked behind the rib cage. I really should have been more careful considering that was our only copy. We could try an X-ray, but they might be difficult to read because they're probably all bloody. Man, we should really switch to digital records.' At press time, Sanders' critics were calling upon the presidential candidate to cut open his chest to release the records."

'Although animal rights activists have long decried placing grouse in sleeper holds, piledriving pheasants, and headbutting doves, we recognize that these inarguably effective moves have a long tradition among wingshooters,' said President Donald Trump in a press conference, adding that no less a man than Theodore Roosevelt had thought nothing of roundhouse kicking a brace of ducks for his dinner. 'They call the move the 'Crossface Chicken Wing' for a reason. Furthermore, banning the use of the common folding chair as an implement for slamming birds across the head is a holdover from the days of ignorant environmentalists who don't respect traditional hunting. True woodsmen know that respecting nature often means wrapping barbed wire around your fist to pummel a Canada goose or digging your thumbs into the eyes of a woodcock, and that there isn't a hunter alive who wouldn't curb stomp a wild turkey.' President Trump then posed for photographs while repeatedly smashing a quail beak-first into one of the White House's marble columns."
81,Experts Concerned Pale Russian Mystic Constantly At Trump's Side May Attempt To Influence 2020 Election,"WASHINGTON'Increasingly troubled about the role the self-proclaimed visionary and healer might play in the presidential race, intelligence experts expressed concerns Friday that Volokov Molchalin, the pale Russian mystic constantly at President Donald Trump's side, may attempt to influence the 2020 election. 'While we're unsure exactly what Volokov is whispering into Trump's ear'or if it's a known language at all'it's the consensus of the intelligence community that he likely intends to meddle in the upcoming election, perhaps by using his self-professed hypnotic powers to sway the American public,' said National Intelligence Director Joseph Maguire, noting that the long-bearded Eastern Orthodox prophet had enjoyed unprecedented access to the Oval Office since laying his hands on the president's thigh in early June and allegedly curing him of an internal hemorrhage. 'What's more unsettling is that Volokov has only grown more brazen in his attempts to alter the president's behavior, encouraging Trump to purify himself by self-flagellating, filling the West Wing with frankincense, or repeating occult incantations until his eyes roll back in a mystical trance. We've also received reports that Volokov can read minds, which would obviously make any counterintelligence efforts difficult, if not impossible.' At press time, terrified officials had escalated their warnings after a failed assassination attempt in which repeated stabbings, a gunshot wound to the head, and an apparent drowning in the freezing Potomac River failed to end the Russian mystic's life."

'I'm supposed to be polishing the silver today, but instead I have to wear a stupid white wig and let Mr. Bloomberg attack the feasibility of my Medicare-for-all plan,' said maid Flora Bishop, who feared the 15-person housekeeping staff would be unable to complete their daily cleaning tasks as their boss forced them to restart the debate yet again after fumbling a question about prison reform. 'We basically just stand around and let him tear our policies apart until he feels like he's won. Usually, I'll just say something about how all my ideas are bad compared to his so I can get back to the laundry. I feel terrible for the landscaper who played Buttigieg last time. Mr. Bloomberg fired him after he made a really good point about trying to buy the election.'

'Look, folks, we are at an important crossroads in our bid for the nomination, and I'm asking you from the bottom of my heart to please, please stop giving to my campaign so I can just end it already,' Biden wrote in an email sent to every individual, corporation, and political action committee that has contributed to his campaign, adding that with their generous help, they could help put him out of his misery at this 'crucial juncture' right before the Nevada caucus. 'I'm going to be honest with you. We're being outpaced in fundraising by the other campaigns, and that is great, because I am very, very tired and ready to admit defeat; so please, whether you have $1 or $100 to spare, don't send either. I know I can count on you to support me as I head back into retirement and try to pretend none of this ever happened.' At press time, sources confirmed Biden began openly weeping when he received a $4 million surge in donations."

'Chantix has made some especially aggressive ad purchases in recent months that helped spread the word about Ray Liotta and his struggle to find a stop-smoking aid that works for him,' said polling expert Kevin Michaels, stressing that the extensive television ad campaign familiarized Americans with Liotta as a 'father, actor, and ex-smoker' and directly led to the polling surge that secured his place on the debate stage. 'What these ads have done for key sections of the electorate is not only boost awareness of Liotta, but also expose voters to his difficulties to quit cold turkey before eventually finding a way to overcome his urge to smoke with Chantix. It's a message of hope that's clearly resonating with voters.' At press time, experts suggested the strategy may have backfired after Amy Klobuchar hammered Liotta for pushing a product that can cause changes in behavior, depressed mood, and nausea."

'There he is, up there'those circus clowns are tossing him back and forth,' said visibly relieved senior adviser Anita Dunn, waving her arms at the seven-term former U.S. senator, who was attempting to make an impassioned speech about his legislative record despite being severely entangled in aerial silks and dangling 50 feet in the air. 'Even if we got him down from there right now, we still wouldn't make it to the debate venue on time, and he does seem to be shouting his most important talking points at the guys playing those big Japanese drums and the two musclemen flying around on bungees. To be honest, I haven't seen him looking this coherent in a long time. Why don't we just let the vice president have a nice night for once?'

'We've also instructed our canvassers to confiscate any materials supporting other candidates. In some cases, we might actually take some men into custody and bring them back to campaign headquarters. This is a massive undertaking that will run well beyond Super Tuesday. We've already set up Bloomberg-branded vans in black neighborhoods across the country to spread our message. It'll all be worth it once these young black men hear what Bloomberg has to say about funding social security while they're pressed up against a brick wall with an elbow digging into their backs.'

'We originally planned to use a new app to tabulate votes, but after witnessing the difficulties experienced in Iowa's caucuses, we thought, 'Why not use an app to cast the votes, too?'

'Bloomberg is continuing to perform poorly among African American men who were between 16 and 25 years old when they were arrested for possession of marijuana during his tenure as mayor of New York,' said lead pollster Nadia Bresner, confirming that fewer than 2% of survey respondents who were still serving prison sentences as a result of stop-and-frisk policies named Bloomberg as one of their top three favorite candidates. 'These numbers suggest that these individuals strongly connected to other candidates' policies of not having them detained and incarcerated based on their race.

We're talking about an organization complicit in torture at Abu Ghraib, massacres in Vietnam, and a whole slew of war crimes going back to the Mexican'American War. Clearly Bernie is some sort of plant.' At press time, sources confirmed Sanders' remaining supporters had trickled away after they discovered the avowed anti-billionaire candidate apparently nursed hopes of moving into the nation's 132-room executive mansion."
110,"2020 Race Upended After New Poll Finds Trump, Democrats Trailing Mysterious Rune-Covered Obelisk By 80 Points","ROCKPORT, IN'Revealing that the latest addition to the presidential race had totally upended the 2020 election, a national poll conducted Monday found that President Donald Trump, as well as every single Democratic candidate, were now trailing a mysterious rune-covered Obelisk by 80 points. The newest numbers, which come from Emerson College, found that the 200-foot tall pillar, which reportedly has cryptic, glowing symbols engraved onto its surface, is now dominating among Democrats, Republicans, and independents. Several major polls also indicated that after the monolithic column suddenly materialized in a cornfield and began emitting a low humming noise, statisticians observed an extreme uptick in voters who previously supported Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren, Andrew Yang, Amy Klobuchar, Tom Steyer, Mike Bloomberg, and Donald Trump announcing in unison that they intended to cast their ballot for 'the one true candidate: the Obelisk.' 'From its late entrance into the race to the way it attracts people from all over the political spectrum, the Obelisk is really what you'd call a dark horse candidate,' said pollster Leslie Fabacher, adding that voters responded positively to its imposing figure and independent gravitational field. 'Sure, this arcane column made from some indeterminable material could have ended up another Tom Steyer or Michael Bloomberg, but now, Americans of virtually every demographic, regardless of age, gender, race, or religion, are connecting with the Obelisk's mesmerizing thrum.' 'Voters really seem to relate to this Washington outsider that comes from a realm unknown to science,' Fabacher added. According to pollsters, out of the 500 rural Indiana residents surveyed, over 99% pledged total obedience to the infallible Obelisk. In addition, respondents said that they felt confident about the future after gazing upon the constantly shifting runes emblazoned on the monolith. When asked if they would consider voting for a candidate other than the Obelisk, those surveyed were either heard screaming in pain or answered, 'The Obelisk is all; we are the Obelisk.' According to the Federal Election Commission, the Obelisk has already shattered all fundraising records as compliant Americans from across the country emptied their bank accounts and flocked to the mystifying pillar to drop all of their earthly possessions in front of it. Polls also showed that pro-Obelisk Democrats and Republicans did not mind that the Obelisk was registered with a party by the name of '[indecipherable runic language].' 'When I felt the rumble beneath me and saw a white-hot, screaming Obelisk suddenly appear out of thin air, I knew that was the candidate for me,' said Iowa voter Aaron Yalder, 49, adding that while he had been undecided for months, the Obelisk blinded him and commanded him to drop all other political allegiances. 'Sure, I like that Sanders supports the United Steelworkers Union. And I like that Trump is tough on crime. But there was just something about that deep, low voice, speaking in a language I could not comprehend, occupying my every thought and controlling my every move.' 'There is only the Obelisk,' Yalder added. 'How can you argue with that?' While the enigmatic column has only been in the race for less than 24 hours, the Obelisk has also secured the endorsements of numerous leading political figures, such as Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY), as well as former presidents Jimmy Carter, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama, who have all been spotted with the Obelisk, unconscious, floating hundreds of feet above the ground. Even organizations such as Priorities USA, America First, and Citizens United have thrown their support and money behind the mysterious pillar, citing it as 'The one choice. The only choice.' 'Look, when it comes to politics, there's no other candidate that has connected with all Americans past and all Americans future, and has pledged to reinstate the Clean Waters Act,' said Jessica Karling, a leader at SuperPac American Bridge, rending her clothes and filling the Obelisk's runes with the blood of her newborn. 'I've been doing this for over 50 years, and it's not just the fact I am its vessel and it is my one true God and I would murder anyone for the Obelisk, anyone, just tell me, I'll kill them'it's the fact that it really cares about the American people.' 'It's 2020, and this is going to be an election like we've never seen before,' she added while bowing down to the Obelisk and self-flagellating with a tulip tree branch. At press time, the Obelisk, which reportedly vaporized Senator Amy Klobuchar, after she denounced the monolith as divisive, immediately surged to a 100% approval rating."
111,Increasingly Unhinged Centrists Announce Plan To Round Up Nation Into Camps To Force Them To Engage In Meaningful Dialogue,"WASHINGTON'Explaining that they were forced to take more radical measures to ensure the success of their moderate political platform, increasingly unhinged U.S. centrists announced Monday their plan to round up the nation's populace into camps to force them to engage in meaningful dialogue. 'As more Americans adopt left-wing or right-wing views, compromise to a moderate position will require more drastic action, which is why we've decided to herd every last American into trains and bring them to camps encircled in barbed wire where they will be forced to discuss their views at gunpoint,' said a wild-eyed Leland Welsh, spokesperson for the centrist think tank Third Way, which was behind the funding of the large open-air detention center where divided Americans would be forced to shake hands until their palms bled and go without food and water until they had agreed to understand and embrace the positions of their political opponents. 'We believe that all Americans possess the capacity to find a middle ground on every single issue, which is why we're going to force their eyes open to read opinion pieces by their political adversaries, make them listen to speeches by Hillary Clinton and Mitt Romney blaring on loudspeakers 24 hours a day, and compel them to remain standing for long periods of time while our guards scream 'We can all get along!' In these camps, expressions of animosity toward another inmate's belief system, or uttering anything besides the phrase 'But that's just my opinion, and I'd love to hear yours' will be punishable by death. We will stop at nothing to ensure that all Americans hold the exact same centrist belief system.' The visibly crazed political centrists added that if the camps were unable to force any Americans to find common ground with one another, they would sell them in new slave markets to a company that would."

113,Buttigieg Touts Progress Connecting With Black Fortune 500 Executives,"SOUTH BEND, IN'Addressing concerns over his campaign's marked lack of inclusion, Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg touted significant progress he made Friday connecting with black Fortune 500 executives. 'I've heard your concerns, and over the past few weeks, I've made great efforts to not just talk to but listen to prominent members of the African American consulting community,' said the former South Bend mayor, emphasizing that he had hosted several round tables across the country where he had personal, one-on-one conversations with black VPs of weapons manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies, and Silicon Valley tech giants. 'While I might not have lived the same experiences, I hope that my campaign will feel inclusive to all executives of color, in all management levels, regardless of whether they attended Harvard or Yale. As someone who worked at McKinsey myself, I know firsthand that we can't win the presidency without them.' At press time, Buttigieg unveiled a new plan to diversify his campaign staff by hiring a single black finance executive to the Pete 2020 board."

'Sure, withholding military aid to an ally in wartime in order to secure an investigation into a political rival isn't the best, but it's wrong to squander all of this bright young man's potential over one little abuse of power,' said Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY), explaining that it would be easy to look back and find a time in pretty much anyone's life when they tried to compel a foreign government to interfere in a national election because they didn't know any better. 'It would be unfair to blemish this gifted young man's record forever just because he committed a single high crime in his 70s. Just ask yourself: do we really want this one miscarriage of public trust in democratic institutions to follow him for the rest of his life?' At press time, McConnell was heartened that an acquitted Trump still had an entire life of undermining democracy for his personal benefit ahead of him."
117,Trump Spends National Prayer Breakfast Attacking God For Allowing Impeachment To Ever Happen,"WASHINGTON'Unleashing a tirade on the supreme deity in an overtly partisan display at the traditionally nonpolitical event, President Donald Trump spent Thursday's National Prayer Breakfast fiercely attacking God for allowing impeachment to ever happen. 'As everyone knows, my family, your great country, and the presidency have been put through the ringer by this supposedly great God and the crooked angels who let this hoax happen,' said the president, boasting that his approval rating was far higher than the Lord's would ever be while holding aloft a copy of The Washington Post's front-page 'Trump acquitted' headline and quipping that the Almighty did not seem so all-powerful anymore. 'Honestly, folks, this is a very dishonest and corrupt creator we're talking about. He says He loves everybody, but He's really a fool and a liar. Frankly, our maker never should have been given the power to create the Universe, let alone pull the strings to humiliate me in front of the entire country. Hate to say it, but it's true.' At press time, the gathering of Christian preachers and prayer groups gave Trump a thunderous standing ovation after the president said that the Lord could eat shit and he was looking forward to when His Holiness finally died."
118,Sanders Makes Last-Minute Appeal To Moderates By Reminding Them All His Policies Would End Up Being Watered Down To Their Positions Anyway,"MANCHESTER, NH'In a last-minute attempt to court the much-sought-after demographic, Senator Bernie Sanders appealed to a town hall of moderates Thursday by reminding them all of his policies would wind up getting watered down enough to match their positions anyway. 'Listen, I understand many of you are nervous about my so-called radical stances on healthcare and abolishing ICE, but I'd urge you to remember they will ultimately be so diluted by the political process and left so utterly toothless that none of you could possibly oppose the end result,' said Sanders, assuring the center-left voters that since two-thirds of all Senate Democrats are on the record as not backing his Medicare For All proposal, even placing it on his website was at best wishful thinking compared to the sort of slight incremental progress that his White House would realistically be able to enact. 'Let's be honest here: Based on the center-leaning composition of Congress and where we stand ideologically as a country, my administration would be very lucky to even get a public option on the books. So what I'm saying here is don't worry. By the time the lobbyists get through with gutting my platform, it'll only be palatable to ineffectual middle-of-the-road voters like yourselves.' At press time, Sanders had received a standing ovation from the gathering after he closed his speech by noting that many of his far-left supporters would likely end up despising him for the compromises he would be forced to make as president."

'Watching the Democrats cower behind ineffectual high-minded rhetoric while the Republicans manipulated every procedure and spouted dangerous propaganda really affirmed my belief that today's U.S. government is working exactly as intended,' said 43-year-old retail manager Aaron Bennett, echoing the sentiments of 325 million Americans who confirmed that although the impeachment trial had shaken their faith in their leaders, watching the Democrats belatedly pursue a narrow goal that resisted meaningfully challenging any structural issues, only to let themselves be easily obstructed by Republican leaders committed to holding power regardless of the consequences, offered sorely needed reassurance of the strength of the U.S. political system. 'I was really worried impeachment indicated that the American way of life for the last several decades was at risk. I admit I even doubted whether our institutions could survive several Republicans deviating from their cynical embrace of an obvious criminal in order to further their callous agenda. The idea that Democrats were actually trying to pursue a moral objective instead of just using moral rhetoric as a smokescreen for accumulating influence really shook me. I'm just grateful that both parties were able to move past their differences and work together to uphold the American political system as we know it.' The relieved nation added that it would have been devastating if the Senate removed Trump, which would fly in the face of what the founding fathers wanted when they inscribed the principle of a few rich men shielding each other from accountability into the nation's Constitution."

'While I understand this medal represents the highest civilian honor possible, I was a bit disconcerted to discover this morning that I share this distinction with both a civil rights icon and a poet who gave a voice to black Americans,' said Limbaugh, who explained that he hopes people don't doubt his integrity as he joins the ranks of the award's previous recipients, especially Cicely Tyson, Ralph Ellison, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Stevie Wonder, and Willie Mays. 'I almost sent it back. But instead I have decided to keep my Medal of Freedom and let it stand as a testament to my willingness to tolerate others. I hope my acceptance of it will go some way toward reclaiming this honor from the Martin Luther Kings and Nelson Mandelas of the world.' At press time, Limbaugh confirmed he felt more confident that the award meant something after learning it had also been given to Henry Kissinger and Strom Thurmond."

'As of this morning, we have commissioned the design and manufacture of a cutting-edge tabulation device that will be able to legibly report vote totals on a sheet of paper 99% of the time,' said DNC chair Tom Perez, holding up a rough prototype of the 7.5-inch hexagonal marking implement, which will be built and rigorously stress-tested by a new Silicon Valley business venture known as Sharpen. 'It may not be easy to encase a cylinder of graphite with wood or put a slick coat of glossy paint on its outside. But with this new partnership, we believe we will soon have at our disposal a pencil that is both reliable and totally resistant to any attack by foreign powers. Also, because it can be sharpened, this new delegate-reporting tool can be used repeatedly, lasting us through New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina, and perhaps even Super Tuesday.' At press time, sources confirmed plans for the pencil had been scrapped after election security experts warned the rubber eraser on its tip would quickly erode public trust in the product."
125,DNC Blames Iowa Caucus Problems On Single Fuck-Up Senior Citizen Volunteer,"WASHINGTON'Claiming the 89-year-old woman's numerous blunders had caused the delay to the state's results, Democratic National Committee chair Tom Perez told reporters Tuesday that all problems with the Iowa Caucus could be blamed on a single fuck-up senior citizen volunteer. 'What it comes down to is that this costly and embarrassing mistake can be traced to one elderly volunteer named Muriel Luntz,' said Perez, adding that the party had hesitated on whether to release details about the Dubuque-based widow and five-time election volunteer, but ultimately decided to do so based on the gravity of Luntz's empty-headed missteps in singlehandedly derailing the first-in-the-nation caucus. 'Obviously, I don't want to speculate, but I don't think this woman is all there upstairs anymore. That's the only way I could imagine someone bungling our exceptional election security measures. It's a shame that just one numbskull could blemish the DNC's sterling record. So let me just say that I completely hear the outpouring of frustration from voters and want them to know that any of their outrage should be sent directly to her home address, which we'll be releasing online soon.' Perez also pledged that as an effort to tamp down on further mistakes, he would ensure that by the next election, the idiotic octagenarian would no longer be alive."

'He's obviously not our first choice, but Trump has a track record of winning elections, not to mention he does well with the conservative voters we'll need to swing some red states blue'if that's who we need to ask to ensure Bernie doesn't win, we'll do it,' said DNC chairman Tom Perez, who had circled Trump's name on a white board lising dozens of potential candidates the party could try to convince to jump into the Democratic Party primaries in order to obstruct a Sanders nomination. 'This late in the game, we need somebody with name recognition and a built-in following, which Trump definitely has. He has political experience working with Republicans, which will help him win over moderate voters who are turned off by the idea of a socialist president. Plus, he'll have the backing of the Democratic donor base, who generally prefer him to Sanders. Look, sometimes politics makes strange bedfellows, but I think I speak for party leadership when I say that we'd much rather see Donald Trump than Bernie Sanders as the Democratic nominee.' At press time, Perez was in negotiations to ensure Trump was on every Democratic primary ballot for Super Tuesday and changing the requirements to allow Trump to qualify for the next Democratic debate."
129,Report: Fighting Rising Tide Of Authoritarianism Sounds Like A Lot Of Work,"WASHINGTON'Confirming the challenges associated with preserving liberal democracy, the nation's top political scientists issued a report Friday that found fighting against the rising tide of authoritarianism sounds like a ton of work. 'After extensive analysis, we can state with a high degree of certainty that meaningfully resisting the erosion of equality and personal freedoms would probably be super exhausting,' said lead researcher Jeremy Dwyer, warning that stemming the flow of autocratic rule would require a sustained campaign of political pressure over a long period of time that would likely make Americans tired just to think about. 'Whether it's attending protests, campaigning for progressive candidates, or even committing to ethical purchasing habits, our data show that engaging at this level would be a whole thing that could eat up a bunch of time. The majority of American citizens are very sleepy and want to get back to their beds as soon as possible. Plus, this all sounds kind of like a big pain in the ass.' Dwyer added that the report concluded it would be so much easier to simply march in unthinking lockstep to an all-powerful ruler. "

'Look here, pal, fuck you and fuck anybody who thinks like you,' the former vice president said to a town hall participant in what political experts have hailed as a rousing call for Democrats, independents, and even moderate Republicans to join together in harmony and overcome the divisiveness and rancor that have characterized the Trump era. 'If that's what you believe, you're clearly an idiot, and I don't need your vote. Seriously, you and every single person in this fucking town deserves to die. Now back the hell up before I tear your throat out with my goddamn teeth.' After the event, a screaming, red-faced Biden reportedly continued to share his inspiring vision by informing a group of unwitting Iowans that he could beat their asses with one hand tied behind his back."

'We have not forgotten about the Palestinian people, and this roadmap will allow them to live in peace within the briny depths of the Mediterranean,' said Kushner, noting that the miles of open water represented a significant increase in Palestanian territory. 'This plan will also allow Palestine to place its capital directly in the Strait of Gibraltar, where it will be separated from Israeli territory by a sea wall. The Palestinians will be given every opportunity to swim and splash around as long as they don't attempt to impede on Israeli sovereignty by trying to crawl out of the water or wash up on the beach.' Kushner added that as a further concession to the Palestinain people, the plan would include a four-year freeze before Israelis could annex the Mediterranean and drive the Palestinians into the Atlantic Ocean."
133,Sanders Unveils Job-Training Program To Provide Meaningful Work To Low-Skilled Op-Ed Writers,"WASHINGTON'Explaining that as president he would ensure his policies didn't leave any Americans behind, Senator Bernie Sanders reportedly unveiled plans Wednesday for a job-training program that would provide meaningful work to low-skilled op-ed writers. 'I understand that if I win the presidency, many Americans are concerned about the effect that changing economic priorities will have on their jobs, which is why I'm committed to making sure that the nation's unskilled columnists receive every opportunity to learn material skills that will enable them to find a rewarding position,' said Sanders, adding that his platform allocated hundreds of millions of dollars a year to ensure workers like opinion columnists who lacked qualifications for any skilled labor job would receive instruction in a career of their choice, such as nursing, childcare, or construction. 'It's true that not every industry makes sense for the world we need to build, whether it's coal mining, private health insurance, or writing histrionic editorials with little factual basis in our nation's newspapers. It pains me to see so many op-ed writers out there who have received so little training or education that they have no capacity to do viable work. But I believe that these op-ed writers and editorial board members want to be productive members of society, and my presidency will do everything it can to help them find work with dignity.' Sanders added that it was an unfortunate result of the U.S. economic system that so many Americans found themselves stuck in low-skilled op-ed writing jobs in the first place."
134,Chris Matthews Warns Bernie Sanders Victory Runs Risk Of Making Him Look Stupid 2 Elections In A Row,"NEW YORK'Cautioning voters against walking down such a dangerous path without fully understanding the potential consequences, MSNBC pundit Chris Matthews warned Hardball viewers Tuesday that Bernie Sanders winning the Democratic party's nomination would run the risk of making him look stupid in two consecutive elections. 'Before anyone casts a vote for Senator Sanders in the primary, they need to look deep inside and consider the ramifications of making me look like a completely out-of-touch idiot again,' said Matthews, insisting that a strong showing from Sanders in early-voting primaries could lead to the complete and utter destruction of the American political commentator's credibility. 'We can't afford to go down the same road we did in 2016. The cost is simply too great to have another four years of me feeling like a clueless fucking moron. Is that a risk Bernie supporters are willing to take?' At press time, a teary-eyed Matthews brought Hardball to a close by asserting that a Sanders presidency could negatively affect him for decades."

'I've kept an open mind from the beginning, but nothing I have seen thus far has altered the fundamental nature of my reelection prospects in my home state,' said Ernst, adding that while some of the president's actions have been questionable, she didn't believe they had risen to a level that would harm her standing amongst conservative Iowa voters. 'Though they've had plenty of opportunities, Democrats have failed to make a persuasive case that Trump's behavior would lead to my constituents abandoning me en masse, and unless I see some arguments of that nature soon, I think my mind is made up.' Ernst added that she took this responsibility seriously as she had given a sacred oath to consolidate her grip on power by whatever means necessary."

Trump's defense attorney is expected to argue against statements made during the Clinton impeachment by special prosecutor Ken Starr. Honestly kind of bored by this cakewalk. A staunch defender of the president, the Republican congressman has a deep connection to the case both as an investigator and co-conspirator. GOP senator considered most likely to make the loudest sigh before acquitting Trump. The Senate minority leader wants to hear from witnesses in the White House, but we all want things we'll never get. As a servant of the law, finds it impossible to sit on the sidelines while a wealthy sex predator faces consequences. Trump's former advisor has agreed to offer explosive testimony against the president for $5 per word. The hesitant speaker of the House eventually pushed through articles of impeachment, while making it clear she never thought through any of this. Donald Trump is the 45th and current president of the United States. As the lead impeachment manager, there was no better choice to provide the heavy-handedness, Russia hysteria, and whiff of corruption the Democrats needed to ensure the nation tuned out. The longtime White House maid is said to have been a witness to many of the events in question. But is she more than she seems?"
137,CBS Inks Deal For 30-Episode Bloomberg Ad,"NEW YORK'Citing its productive relationship with the multibillionaire in the two months since he announced his candidacy, CBS officials confirmed Tuesday that the network had inked a deal to air a 30-episode advertisement for Michael Bloomberg's presidential campaign. 'We've had a great run with Mayor Bloomberg's shorter ads, so we're thrilled to welcome him into our lineup with a full series of hour-long episodic commercials,' said a spokesperson for the television network, indicating the commercials will run immediately after NCIS on Tuesdays, though independent reports have confirmed they will also re-air throughout the week as often as the former New York mayor wants them to. 'Mike is a relentless, self-made presidential candidate we think will really resonate with viewers when they are given this opportunity to see the full arc of his run for the White House. We have his campaign merchandise for sale in CBS's online store, and with any luck, we'll soon be in talks about a second 30-episode ad. Frankly, we're willing to keep this running for as many seasons as the mayor would like.' CBS officials said the deal included a proposed crossover episode of Young Sheldon in which Bloomberg would guest star, warning the Cooper family about the dangers of consuming large, sugary drinks."

'Make no mistake: America will not sit idly by while someone or other engages in what we say are continued irrefutable acts of aggression,' said Pompeo, emphasizing that the United States reserves the right to exercise full military might in order to protect its political and economic interests wherever. 'Although the nation in question may be an undetermined or undefined distance from America's borders, it remains crucial to protect our sovereignty and come to the aid of our allies, if any, in someplace, somewhere on the globe. We even have good reason to suspect that pretty much anyone anywhere is currently in the process of developing a nuclear arsenal.' Pompeo also confirmed that the Pentagon had detailed contingency plans for possible preemptive strikes on everywhere."
142,Liberals Say Sanders's Acceptance Of Rogan Endorsement Sends Dangerous Message He Trying To Win Election,"WASHINGTON'Slamming the campaign for promoting the popular podcaster's backing, liberals said Friday that Bernie Sanders's acceptance of Joe Rogan's endorsement sends a dangerous message that the candidate is trying to win the 2020 presidential election. 'This is just the Sanders campaign opening the gates to a plurality of people who would vote for him and help him win the presidency,' said political commentator Scott Griffin, who called the campaign's promotion of Rogan's endorsement a true 'mask off' moment, exposing Sanders's goal of winning the Democratic primary and eventually the general election. 'It's very unnerving to see a Democratic candidate like Bernie Sanders try to court voters from varying constituencies and demographics. It's like his whole strategy is beating Trump. We saw hints of this in 2016, but I'm truly sickened to see it rearing its ugly head again. I'm all for creating a Democratic majority, but not if we have to accept more people than the other side has.' Griffin added that it was even more disturbing that Sanders would attempt this during an election year."
143,Melting Giraffe Congressman Warns Impeachment Distracting From Surreal Issues,"WASHINGTON'Arguing that a protracted congressional trial wasn't in the best interests of everyday floating nude Americans, melting giraffe congressman Fauna Anuaf reportedly warned Friday that focusing on the impeachment of President Donald Trump was distracting from the surreal issues. 'When there are so many people in this country imprisoned inside two-dimensional towers or struggling with their legs turning into water, we cannot let ourselves get caught up in a biased proceeding that does nothing to address the surreal problems many Americans face,' said the melting giraffe congressman (E-EEE), adding that in his district, residents were worried about biomorphic trains materializing through their walls, orca whales trapped in bottles on an endless desert landscape, or being flayed on a fainting couch while three heads in bowler hats screamed that their body is a chorus of bodies diffusing under the heat of time itself, not some court proceeding. 'The moment my constituents poured candle wax into the endless thermometer to elect me to Congress, I took their wailing approval as a solemn reminder to keep focused on the surreal issues. At every town hall back in my inverted ether, my constituents come to slice my eyeball, which I understand as a sign that impeachment doesn't enjoy broad support. And we need to stop this partisan bickering'I didn't swear an oath to be a Democrat or Republican; I swore an o"
144,Trump Makes Powerful Pro-Life Case By Speaking About The Joys Of Neglecting A Child,"WASHINGTON'Speaking to thousands of March For Life protesters assembled on the National Mall, President Donald Trump took to the stage Friday to make a powerful pro-life case about the joys of neglecting a child. 'Of course, I'm a father, and I had my thoughts about terminating them all, but I'm standing before you today to tell you that I'm glad I didn't because I would never have gotten to experience the simple but incredible pleasures of pawning them off on the help for the first decade or so of their lives,' said Trump, defending the anti-abortion movement with a stirring speech about how profoundly being an absent and indifferent father had affected his life. 'I wish I could describe to you how good it feels to avoid every soccer game and piano recital, and how incredible it's been watching them grow from a child I couldn't care less about to an adult I barely know. Whether it's Ivanka, Don Jr., or one of the other two, they've each been a blessing that I never would have known if they had been aborted.' Trump went on to bring several audience members to tears by describing in detail the moment he first realized he'd be able to bully and emotionally terrorize his children forever. "

'These horrible rules created by Barack Obama are one of the worst examples of government overreach in our nation's history, and they are totally unfair to the deadly leviathan known as Gangthor,' said Trump, who was later overheard muttering ancient incantations reportedly intended to loosen the cursd chains that shackle the nefarious shadow-behemoth to the ocean floor. 'I will personally swim to the bottom of the Pacific and use a golden key inscribed with mysterious runes to unlock Gangthor's lair, where he has slumbered since the destructive Clean Water Rule of 2015 was issued. This shape-shifting, multi-tentacled monster will then once more be unleashed upon the waters of the United States, restoring the property rights of American farmers, fossil fuel companies, and real estate developers.' The president went on to criticize 'prophets of doom' who have predicted Gangthor the Malevolent will rise in a column of smoke and fire upon his release, blocking out the sun and blighting the earth with a thousand years of darkness."

'As you address members of this deliberative body, please bear in mind that nothing you say or do will have any effect on the completely predetermined outcome of these proceedings,' said Roberts, exhorting the two sides to go ahead and establish facts, promulgate lies, cite the Constitution, or engage in purely cynical bad-faith arguments, because none of it really mattered anyway. 'I wish to remind you this trial is a hollow exercise of decorum with no possibility of achieving productive results of any kind. We're just going through the motions here, we all know how it is going to end, so let's at least try to keep it brief.' At press time, the chief justice had commended both sides for heeding his admonition and working to keep the monumental miscarriage of justice running smoothly."
148,Senate Republicans Force Through Resolution Establishing Wingstop As Official Sponsor Of Impeachment Trial,"WASHINGTON'Over the objections of Democrats who decried the measure as not receiving sufficient debate on the congressional floor, Senate Republicans forced through a resolution Wednesday establishing Wingstop as the official sponsor of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial. 'Resolved that effective immediately, all questions, witness statements, and other utterances must include a recommendation to eat at Wingstop, and the Wingstop logo must be clearly visible on all name placards, subpoenaed documents, and other written material,' read Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) from the resolution on the Senate floor, adding that Wingstop's $25 million deal to sponsor the impeachment trial was the best offer Congress received and ignoring pleas from Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) to wait for Panera Bread to finalize its proposal. 'This resolution also stipulates that each senator must be photographed with Wingstop's lemon pepper wings on each day of the trial as part of our promotion, all social media posts about the impeachment must be accompanied with the #RightWingstop hashtag, and that the only food permitted in the chamber will be Wingstop wing combos with fries or veggie sticks and a 20-ounce soft drink. This is in order to ensure the impeachment trial remains a place where flavor gets its wings. Democracy works best when we're full of chicken.' The resolution did make an exception, however, for Chief Justice John Roberts, who informed the Senate that the Wingstop contract could not apply to him, as he has an exclusive sponsorship with Buffalo Wild Wings."
149,Contrarian 'New York Times' Travel Section Breaks With Paper To Endorse Deval Patrick For Democratic Nomination,"NEW YORK'In a dramatic challenge of the editorial board, The New York Times travel section broke with the paper Tuesday to endorse former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick for the Democratic nomination. 'Given his impressive track record as a card-carrying Hyatt Loyalty Program member and the only candidate with TSA PreCheck, we are left no choice but to split with the main body of this organization and endorse Deval Patrick,' said travel editor Amy Virshup, explaining that the section's values have been diverging from the rest of the newspaper for years and that The Time's co-endorsement of Klobuchar and Warren did not reflect the values of American jet-setters nearly as well as Patrick. 'Patrick thoroughly impressed us with his comprehensive plan for the best way to spend 36 hours in Marrakech, and proved he's ready to lead with his extensive knowledge of everything from using concierge services to where to find the best bar in the Seattle area. Whether you prefer a family vacation or a romantic getaway, for the conscientious traveler, there is no better candidate than Deval Patrick.' At press time, an emergent Deval Patrick had picked up endorsements from every major American newspaper's travel section."
150,Kellyanne Conway Suggests Martin Luther King Jr. Would Have Traveled To Ukraine For Dirt On Biden,"WASHINGTON'Praising the civil rights leader for his determination and commitment to justice, Kellyanne Conway, senior counselor to the president, suggested to reporters Monday that Martin Luther King Jr. would have traveled to Ukraine for dirt on Joe Biden. 'Dr. Martin Luther King, who was known for his nonviolent tactics, including protests and community organizing, would certainly have traveled abroad to pressure foreign nations to expose a political enemy's secrets,' said Conway, who explained that if King were alive today, he would without a doubt hop on a flight to Kiev to meet with Ukrainian government officials to acquire potentially damaging information about Biden's younger son, Hunter. 'While much of the United States remains divided, Dr. King had a brave and bold vision hinged on withholding aid from Ukraine for personal political purposes. He understood that civil disobedience is essential in fighting a corrupt system, so he wasn't afraid to spend the night in jail or do a little quid pro quo. In fact, some of his most famous tweets were written from jail.' Conway added that it was a shame such a great civil rights leader had been impeached so young."

'The House peach managers [sic] are never, ever gonna be able to find dad way deep in here!' said Donald Trump Jr., who stapled a note with the message 'definitely no president inside' to blankets as an extra security precaution while Eric Trump punched air holes through the pillows with a pair of scissors. 'Stay right there, dad, and don't move till 2050. We read through the whole constant tuition [sic] and it says those guys can't impeach you if they can't find you. Here are two pieces of bread for dinners, and a straw you can use as a snorkel. Close your eyes real tight and you'll be totally invisible. Okay, see you later. We're gonna glue the bunker door shut.' At press time, the Trump boys were panicking after realizing they'd lost their father."

'Look, as senators, we swore a solemn oath to deliver justice, and I intend to abide by that precisely as we use this trial to scrutinize the facts and then determine exactly how'and indeed, if'we will storm into the Oval Office, hoist the delighted president aloft, and regale him with spirited rounds of 'Hip, hip, hurray,'' said Sen. Mitch McConnell, noting that his awesome responsibility as the chamber's majority leader required him to tamp down on any partisan speculation on whether Senate Republicans would rush to raise the president up onto their shoulders while singing 'He's A Jolly Good Fellow' or if Senate Republicans would opt for a more stately procession in which they conveyed the recently acquitted Trump past each and every Democratic congressperson's office. 'Unlike some of my liberal colleagues, I understand my solemn role in this trial is to examine all the information at hand before passing judgment. Then, and only then, can we know whether it's a reasonable course of action to deploy some form of red-white-and-blue confetti while repeatedly tossing President Trump into the air. Until then, it would simply be irresponsible to comment on whether or not we will incorporate party horns, noisemakers, or a big cake covered with lit sparklers into the proceedings.' At press time, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin had commended McConnell on his commitment to impartiality as they came to a swift conclusion on whether or not they should cue up Kool and the Gang's 'Celebration' on the Senate's speaker system."
154,CNN Reveals Bernie Sanders Running For President Of Country With History Of Sexism,"WASHINGTON'Calling their bombshell report incredibly damning, CNN revealed Thursday that Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders has been knowingly running a campaign to become president of a country with a long history of sexism. 'This new evidence proves beyond a doubt that Bernie Sanders strongly wants to lead a nation that has repeatedly enabled, supported, and encouraged misogyny,' said Anderson Cooper in a breaking news segment, claiming to have several documents directly linking Sanders to a country that did not even allow women to vote until the 20th century. 'Right here is a transcript of the text this woman-hating country was founded upon, a country which he willfully lives in and has publicly sworn an oath to, mind you. On just the first page it explicitly declares that all men are created equal, with absolutely no mention of women. And down here'look closely at these signatures that ratified this document as the supreme law of the land. You guessed it, all men.' At press time, CNN confirmed that Sanders had not yet denied his close ties to this country nor its tens of millions of residents with deeply ingrained biases against women."
155,Stephen Miller Hurt At Being Passed Over For Job Stalking Female Ambassador,"WASHINGTON'After learning that Ukraine police had opened an investigation into whether associates of the president had surveilled the diplomat in Kyiv last year, White House senior advisor Stephen Miller was reportedly upset Thursday at being passed over for a job stalking female U.S. ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. 'When I found out that some of Giuliani's goons had been tailing the ambassador around Ukraine, my heart just sank'I mean, how could they decide to follow a lady around and not pick me to do the job?' said Miller, who added that after all the thankless tasks he had performed for the Trump administration over three-plus years in office, he figured he would be at the top of the list when a plum gig like stalking a woman on the administration's behalf came along. 'If I had known there was an opening for shadowing an important lady, I would've absolutely thrown my hat in the ring. Maybe I got passed over because I'm already stalking a bunch of women here in the U.S., but I still would've been able to manage my time and make it work. It really hurts that they didn't even bother to ask. It would be one thing if I didn't have any experience in tracking women without them knowing, but I'm really good at it. I can keep quiet in an alleyway, or stay awake idling in the car, or huddle in a closet without a peep for hours. And I'm really good at gathering hair and undergarments. I just wish they'd given me a chance.' At press time, Miller had decided to cheer himself up by lying below the former ambassador's bed wearing her clothing while she was asleep."
156,CNN Audio Analysis Reveals Biden Caught On Wet Mic While Chewing On Own Microphone,"DES MOINES, IA'Emphasizing that the leaked recording would clear up any confusion about the various crunching, slurping, and gurgling sounds heard after the Iowa Democratic Debate, CNN released a wet mic audio analysis Thursday that revealed Joe Biden had been caught chewing on his own microphone. 'While at first, the recording only picks up Biden shaking hands and joking with his fellow candidates, we eventually hear him tapping on the mic and whispering, 'Oh, what is this? Come to papa,'' said CNN audio engineer Kristen Jennings, adding that the former vice president can then be heard sniffing the lavalier, licking it once, and then sticking it directly into his mouth. 'After hours of analysis, our team has determined that Biden then attempted to chew the mic before saying 'ew' and spitting it out onto the ground. Then, a few minutes later, he decided to pick it back up, pop it back into his mouth, chew it, and ultimately, swallow it.' At press time, CNN confirmed that the microphone's audio had also picked up ample evidence that Biden had successfully passed the mic two days later."

'I have overturned the decision to assassinate Gen. Soleimani and ordered our military to rescind the Jan. 3 drone strike that destroyed his convoy at Baghdad International Airport,' said Trump, who explained the move would revoke Soleimani's status as a Shiite martyr and decrease the likelihood of the United States being drawn into an unpopular war with Iran. 'The U.S. Air Force operation that killed the general was conducted without the consent of Congress and, more significantly, without the backing of the American people. So today our forces in the region will take immediate action to return Soleimani to his family unexploded. This doesn't mean we won't take him out in a future operation if surveys indicate a majority of swing-state voters approve of such an action, but for now we will allow him to resume command of the Quds Force.' The president added that he has yet to see any polls that would convince him to retract his October decision to let Turkey kill hundreds of Kurdish civilians in Syria."
160,Biden Asks Advisors How Much Longer He Has To Pretend To Be Confused And Doddering To Avoid Criticism,"DES MOINES, IA'Cutting off his chief strategist midway through a daily meeting to express his unwillingness to continue the deception much longer, former Vice President Joe Biden reportedly asked advisors Wednesday how much longer he has to go through the routine of acting confused and doddering in order to avoid criticism. 'Please, guys, I'm so tired of putting on this whole song-and-dance of stumbling over my words at every public appearance and painfully wincing so it seems like I've completely forgotten a foreign leader's name,' said the presumptive frontrunner, looking at each and every one of his advisors with clear, thoughtful eye contact, while stressing that although his consistent lead in polling showed the strategy had worked spectacularly to shield him from any critique of his record, he also longed to drop this 'entire frail-old-man act' and speak to audiences in full sentences that allowed him to robustly articulate his vision for restoring America's soul. 'Just give me a date when I can start fully enunciating my words in TV spots. That's all. Obviously, I can keep doing the simple stuff like biting my wife's finger or challenging audience members to push-up contests seemingly out of nowhere. I know you think that's helpful. I get that it would sink me in the polls if I were held accountable for past statements and actions, but frankly it's just exhausting to be constantly acting this mentally confused when I know I can be so much stronger out there.' At press time, Biden was begging his advisors to at least never again make him punch himself midway through a debate to give the appearance of his eye filling up with blood."
161,Pros And Cons Of Economic Sanctions,"Economic sanctions, in which a country levies financial penalties against another country, entity, or person, are at the center of tense U.S.'Iran relations, and their use in general is a matter of significant debate. The Onion looks at the pros and cons of economic sanctions. Something to say you tried before starting the war you were planning anyway. Shows populace consequences for insisting on being born powerless in dictatorship. More difficult to quantify deaths they cause than straight-up war. Just nice to have something to announce every once in a while. Only harms people without power to retaliate. Innocent money drawn into other parties' conflict. Probably involve at least some math. Damn it. We wanted to travel there one day. Shit. Denies thousands of citizens sweet taste of Pepsi Max. Not as satisfying to invade country whose citizens already sick and starving to death."

'Help! Help! Can anyone hear me? I don't understand where my donors are if they're not in this cooler,' said Buttigieg, who had reportedly breezed through the diner, ignoring its clientele, before asking a line cook where the back room with all the wealthy campaign funders was located, getting frustrated at the man's confusion, and deciding to find it himself by searching for a hidden passageway as the freezer door locked behind him. 'I don't understand'it's usually right here. They have to hide in the back so we can meet in secret outside the prying eyes of the media and all the poor people. Where is the manager? Why on earth would I enter a rinky-dink joint just to hobnob with a bunch of people eating scrambled eggs and getting five bucks for my trouble when I know there's a cushy hidden back room where I can talk to voters who matter over a glass of champagne? Jesus Christ, where's [spokesperson] Lis [Smith] when I need her? I don't know what I'm going to do. I already called for help in eight languages, and I'm starting to get really cold.' At press time, Buttigieg had resorted to doing his campaign's 'High Hopes' dance in an effort to stay warm."

'We want to have an honest discussion about policies and positions, so if you have any vicious insults or cheap shots you want to take, we ask that you hold back until we have you mic'd up and sitting somewhere cushy,' said moderator Wolf Blitzer, who added that in the offhand chance candidates didn't have anything negative to say, a CNN producer would be able to assist them by offering them a glass of champagne or shot of tequila and some helpful prompts. 'Verbal abuse will not be tolerated on the debate stage, but if you want to call Pete Buttigieg a spineless little bitch in front of the confession cam, we ask that you please go off. Voters have an important choice to make, so we ask that you let any unpleasant feelings build up inside of you until you have the opportunity to get backstage and explode. Crying for an hour and then falling asleep in front of the confession cam is simply standard debate etiquette.' Blitzer added that the footage would be shared in a two-hour-long special following the debate."

'All of them'you have 30 seconds,' said Blitzer, gesturing toward an unlabeled anatomical diagram of the female reproductive organs. 'As a progressive candidate, this is your opportunity to show your advocacy for women's rights once and for all by listing every part of the female genitalia, internal and external, in alphabetical order and then from largest to smallest. Don't forget any of the ligaments or blood vessels.' At press time, Sanders attempted to transition to discussing policy before being cut off and forced to draw the vulva."

'Here's what I'm thinking: We just rattle off an email to Tom's campaign mentioning that we hadn't gotten his $2.5 million debate fee, see if any of his staffers bat an eye, and then take things from there,' said CNN president Jeff Zucker, noting that his team had already received prompt and courteous payment from Steyer's campaign after sending them an itemized list suggesting the network required reimbursement for the candidate's podium and microphone alongside a per-question fee for Wolf Blitzer's time. 'Early on, I told one of his chief aides that we were going to bill them for every word he uttered, and he just nodded and said 'uh-huh, sounds good.' God, he was actually surprised that we were charging them so much less than PBS had at the last debate.' At press time, Steyer was spotted frantically searching his suit pockets after a stage tech informed the businessman that he had failed to compensate the network with $500 for its customary entrance fee."

According to eyewitnesses, absent Booker's ideals of sympathy for those with different viewpoints and compassion for one's political enemies, a series of violent attacks erupted among the candidates, with Joe Biden taking a tire iron to a campaign bus Pete Buttigieg had driven at full speed through a group of the former vice president's canvassers. The sudden lack of caring and cooperation in the political atmosphere also reportedly led Amy Klobuchar to drag Andrew Yang by the hair through the streets of Des Moines, kick the entrepreneur unconscious, and throw him into a river. At press time, Mike Bloomberg is said to have responded to the primary race's new climate by going door-to-door and pistol-whipping dozens of working-class Iowans until they agreed to vote for him."
168,Sanders Campaign Doubles Down With New Ad Warning Americans They'll Never Be Able To Hear A Female President Over The Sound Of Her Vacuum,"DES MOINES'Responding to accusations by members of the Elizabeth Warren campaign that he told her in a 2018 conversation that he didn't believe a woman could win the presidency, the Bernie Sanders campaign doubled down Tuesday with a new television ad warning Americans that they'll never be able to hear a female president over the sound of her vacuum. 'I do not believe that we as Americans can risk electing a female candidate who won't address universal healthcare or climate change over the loud racket of her vacuum cleaner coming from the Oval Office 24 hours a day,' said Sanders over an ominous 30-second black-and-white shot of panicked advisors fleeing a national security meeting when the female president, a woman with a beehive hairdo, high heels, and an apron, accidentally filled the room with thick smoke after burning a pan of cookies in the briefing room oven. 'When you make your decision about the Democratic nominee, consider whether you want a president who is divided between making policy decisions and scrubbing the floors, or trying to take care of our veterans when she's preoccupied with her crying baby. Not to mention the hair dryer whirring all day and night as the lady president does her hair. And how does she expect to keep America safe when she's constantly distracting our top generals by asking them for help opening difficult jars? Maybe we as a nation will be ready for a female president in 2024, if technology has improved so that vacuums are quieter, but until then we can't afford to take the chance.' The Warren campaign reportedly responded with a fundraising email stating that the candidate was disappointed that Sanders had called her every single day since 2016 to say that women should never be allowed in public without a male escort but that she didn't want to discuss the matter further and risk being divisive."
169,Swing Voter Really Relates To Buttigieg's Complete Lack Of Conviction,"DES MOINES, IA'Praising the former South Bend, IN mayor as a 'true champion' of nothing in particular, local swing voter Chris Fernsby told reporters Tuesday he felt a deep connection with presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg's complete lack of conviction. 'As a generally noncommittal person without any firm ideas about how our government should be run, I can see a lot of myself in this up-and-coming young leader with no discernible political identity,' said Fernsby, who added that Buttigieg's vague but carefully focus-grouped positions on Medicare for All and police reform perfectly captured his own indecisive and shifting mindset when it came to issues at stake in the 2020 election. 'Do I have strong views on affordable housing or how much public college tuition should cost? No. But you know what? Neither does Pete Buttigieg. When I listen to his uplifting, substance-free rhetoric, the only thing I can tell for sure is that he really, really wants to be president. And that's good enough for me!' Fernsby went on to add that while he intended to support Buttigieg for the Democratic nomination, he still planned to vote for President Trump in the general election."

'I've spent my whole life worrying about my career, chasing the next big position, but after spending all this time in Iowa, I've realized it's community and family that count,' said Booker, who revealed he's taken a position at the local auto parts store, bought a cute little ranch house, and started volunteering at a nursing home. 'The air is fresher, the people are nicer, and everyone knows your name. I've found peace here. I was working my ass off every day, and for what? To be president of the United States? To pass some immigration plan? That stuff doesn't matter. I just want a quiet garden and people who love me.' Booker added that while girlfriend Rosario Dawson was thinking about moving in, she was more interested in a place with a little more hustle and bustle like Fort Dodge."
172,Prominent Evangelical Magazine Calls For Removing Trump From Holy Trinity,"CAROL STREAM, IL'In a scathing opinion piece published Thursday by Christianity Today, the evangelical magazine's editor-in-chief Mark Galli made the case for President Trump's removal from the Holy Trinity. 'The president has demonstrated repeatedly that he lacks the ethical convictions necessary for us to continue worshipping him as a part of the triune God,' said Galli, explaining that when Trump was seated at the right hand of the Father, many Christians assumed his behavior would by extension be righteous and godly, but this has not been the case. 'While it is not a decision we undertake lightly, our position is firm: If we do not reverse course now'if we continue to accept Mr. Trump as our Lord and Savior in spite of his blackened moral record'who will take the evangelical community seriously in the years to come?' Galli's editorial goes on to reassure readers the magazine supports the deification of Vice President Pence, who in the event of Trump's removal would ascend to a place alongside the Father and the Holy Spirit."
173,DNC Bows To Pressure By Adding Andrew Cuomo To Increase Ethnic Representation On Debate Stage,"LOS ANGELES'In response to criticism that its threshold for participation has reduced the diversity on stage, the Democratic National Committee announced it would increase ethnic representation in Thursday night's debate by allowing New York governor Andrew Cuomo to take part. 'We heard loud and clear from Democratic voters how important it is to have a panel of debaters that reflects the diverse fabric of America, and so we're grateful to Gov. Cuomo for agreeing to join tonight's event on such short notice,' said DNC spokesperson Philip Aldridge, adding that now more than ever it was vital for Democrats to show they are the party of all Americans, whether they be white, Sicilian, Sardinian, or even Venetian. 'Inclusion is at the heart of everything the DNC strives for, and Italian Americans are a group that, especially if you look back at the late 19th and early 20th centuries, has been historically underrepresented in positions of power. What better way to show that the Democratic Party truly cares about people of color?' At press time, DNC officials had confirmed that due to space restrictions, Cuomo would be given Andrew Yang's podium at the debate."
174,DNC Eases Debate Requirements To 0.1% Above Whatever Cory Booker Polling,"WASHINGTON'In response to the presidential candidate's criticism of the party's current rules that have left him unqualified for tonight's Democratic debate, the DNC announced Thursday that they have eased the debate requirements to 0.1% above whatever number Cory Booker was polling. 'We've considered Senator Booker's comments and have agreed to change the overly stringent prerequisites to include those candidates who poll just a fraction of a percentage above him,' said DNC chairman Tom Perez, adding that these less strict qualifications would be tied to a constantly sliding scale contingent on how Senator Booker's campaign was doing at any point during the race, opening up the debate stage to a more inclusive group of Democrats who had low polling numbers that were still higher than Booker's. 'We've also taken the extra step of adjusting the number of necessary donations from 200,000 unique donors to whatever number makes Booker come up just shy of qualifying. We want to thank Senator Booker for pointing out this injustice after he learned that he would not be eligible for the upcoming debate, and we hope that this compromise satisfies Senator Booker's request.' Perez added that the threshold may be relaxed even more to allow any Democratic candidate still in the race onto the debate stage after Cory Booker drops out."
175,Trump Claims He Knows John Dingell Is In Hell Because He Sees Window Into Terrifying Inferno Every Time He Closes His Eyes,"WASHINGTON'Clarifying controversial remarks he made about the deceased Michigan lawmaker last night, Donald Trump told reporters Thursday he can confirm the late congressman John Dingell is in hell because of the window into a terrifying inferno the president sees every time he closes his eyes. 'Each night, when I lie down in bed, I feel the heat of eternal flames and hear the screams of the damned,' said Trump, explaining that he has gazed into the hideous abyss and seen Satan himself feasting upon the maggot-infested corpse of the long-serving former representative. 'John's definitely down there along with all the other poor souls crying out to be released from ceaseless torment. He's always whispering that the fate awaiting me will be far, far worse than his, beyond anything I could possibly comprehend. Why do you think I barely sleep?' Members of the White House press pool were then seen running from the briefing room as the blood drained from the president's face, his eyes rolled back in his head, and, using an inhumanly deep, guttural voice, he began to mutter strange incantations in Latin."
176,GOP Turns Dozens Of House Democrats Away From Impeachment For Failing To Provide Adequate Voter ID,"WASHINGTON'Warning that allowing them to vote without proper documentation would undermine the sanctity of the democratic process, the House GOP turned away dozens of Democrats from impeaching President Donald Trump Wednesday after determining they did not have adequate voter ID. 'This is simply a precautionary measure to make sure that these individuals are, in fact, real U.S. representatives who would be eligible to engage in this process,' said Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), telling reporters that he had been forced to prevent numerous members, including John Lewis, Maxine Waters, and James Clyburn, from entering the congressional chamber since they had not been able to show two forms of government-issued identification, as well as a utility bill, to establish residency. 'Yes, providing adequate ID is a little annoying, but without oversight, these so-called members of Congress could run amok, voting in multiple districts and leading to a fraudulent impeachment. We simply cannot allow this to happen, so if we come across any representatives who appear suspicious, it's imperative we make sure they're thoroughly scrutinized.' Gaetz added that in order to relieve exhausted congressional staffers, impeachment voting had closed several hours early."
177,Congressman Could've Sworn Last Impeachment Was Catered,"WASHINGTON'Looking around the chamber for some sort of food station, Congressman Don Young (R-AK) told reporters Wednesday that he could've sworn the last impeachment hearing he attended was catered. 'When we were impeaching Clinton in the '90s, I'm pretty sure there was a whole spread with, like, soups and sandwiches and a prime rib carving station,' said a peckish Young, explaining that he purposefully didn't bring lunch today because he assumed the House of Representatives would be providing them with a buffet. 'I asked an aide where the grub was, and she told me she could order food for me but I'd have to pay for it'can you believe it? I mean, not even a make-your-own pasta bar for exercising our constitutional duties. At the very least, they could have provided us with some danishes or something.' When it was representative Young's turn to have the floor, sources confirmed he delivered an impassioned diatribe blasting the lack of free food."
178,Poll Finds 54% Of Americans Approve Executing Trump But Leaving Him In Office,"HAMDEN, CT'According to a new poll out Wednesday from Quinnipiac University, 54% of Americans approve of President Trump receiving the death penalty, but believe his transgressions have not risen to a level that warrants removal from office. 'While nearly all survey participants agreed the president should be executed in a highly public setting, only a minority thinks he should receive a proper burial, with more than half stating that the deceased commander-in-chief should be allowed to complete his four-year term,' said polling analyst Rebecca Glenski, explaining that the results indicate an unwillingness among Americans to effectively overturn the outcome of a presidential election. 'Of that 54%, approximately two-thirds said that after he is put to death'preferably by hanging, beheading, or crucifixion'Trump should not only remain in the Oval Office but also be permitted to appear at public events, attend official White House functions, and have a seat at global summits like the G7. In addition, most respondents strongly indicated the president's corpse should stand for re-election next year so the people can decide whether to remove his earthly remains from office.' Polling suggests in 2020 the bloated, lifeless body of Trump would continue to enjoy a strong, built-in advantage in the Electoral College."
179,Congress Reaches $1.4 Trillion Spending Deal To Award Entire Budget To One Lucky American,"WASHINGTON'Praising bipartisan efforts that prevented a government shutdown ahead of the holiday season, Congress reportedly reached a $1.4 trillion spending deal Tuesday to award the entire budget to one lucky American. 'This is going to provide a completely new life for a single and very, very fortunate American,' said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, explaining that anyone who pays taxes is eligible to win except for employees and family members of those working for the federal government. 'We were happy to see both sides step up and make concessions, including the size of the novelty check, who will pull the balls from the raffle drum, and the decision to eliminate the Social Security and Medicare programs. Winners can spend the money on whatever they like, and have the choice between receiving a lump sum or annuity payments of a billion dollars over the next thousand years or so. Second and third place winners will receive a 10-speed bike and $10 Amazon gift certificate respectively.' At press time, sources confirmed that this is only the third time the U.S. government has held such a lottery, which is credited to creating both the Carnegie and Rockefeller fortunes. "
180,And Then Those 12 People Send It To 12 People'That's 144 People!' Says Cory Booker Describing Campaign Newsletter Strategy To Rosario Dawson,"NEWARK'Referring to the 'surefire' system as a sort of pyramid of communication, Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker excitedly walked long-term girlfriend and actress Rosario Dawson through his new network-based strategy to distribute campaign newsletters, sources confirmed Monday. 'And then when those people share it, the 144 turns into over 20,000 people reading, and by the end of the month? That's the whole country!' said a wild-eyed, energized Booker as he paced in front of Dawson, who told the New Jersey senator through a tight smile that it sounded like a great idea. 'Ever since we had to cut staff in New Hampshire, my brain's just been working overtime. I can't believe how easy it is! The trick is to get a teacher or something to email it to parents of the kids, then you're really cooking. It'd be great if a certain actress, who must know 12 people, could endorse me.' At press time, Booker was seen trying to convince Dawson to let him use her garage for an envelope-stuffing party later that week."
181,"Well Spoken, My Good Fellow, But Let Me Retort,' Says Congressman Engaged In Probing, High-Minded Debate On Facts And Merits Of Impeachment","WASHINGTON'Praising the eloquence and noble character of his Democratic colleague before humbly offering a rebuttal, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) engaged in thoughtful and enlightened debate Thursday over the merits of proposed impeachment articles brought against the president of the United States. 'Allow me first to congratulate you upon your exceptional oratory and remark upon what a great honor it is to deliberate this matter with a man of such high integrity,' said Jordan, who addressed House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) in measured and courtesy tones, commending civil discourse as the bedrock of a democratic society. 'Although you have made some very cogent and incisive rhetorical points this morning, I must, unfortunately, submit a rejoinder in which I shall seek to elucidate what I believe to be a fallacy in your position. Despite our arrival at this occasion of discord, please know I consider you a true compatriot: a fellow truth-seeker with no interest beyond securing what is best for our great republic.' At press time, witnesses confirmed Jordan had nearly beaten Nadler to death with a cane after being set off by a remark impugning the honor of the president."
182,Fox News Condemns 2020 Election As Partisan Witch Hunt Orchestrated By Democrats To Unseat President,"NEW YORK'Calling the running and nomination of a candidate a blatant abuse of power from the left, Fox News personality Tucker Carlson condemned the 2020 election Thursday as a partisan witch hunt orchestrated by Democrats to unseat President Trump. 'This is nothing more than a Soviet-style democratic election,' said Carlson, adding that the timing of the election was especially suspicious, coming after Trump has already been in office for three years. 'The millions of dollars spent on campaign ads and televised debates clearly point to some larger conspiracy being pushed by the left; it's a total coup! This poorly executed attempt to downplay the president's overwhelming electoral victory in 2016 with some sort of flimsy pretext to democracy is inexcusable and the exact type of threat our founding fathers warned us about. Frankly, it's unconstitutional and shameful to see Democrats stoop to such low levels.' At press time, Democratic candidates had announced the suspension of their campaigns saying this kind of divisiveness was not what America needs right now. "

Politicians still free to post thirst traps on personal accounts. Look on Hillary Clinton's face if we started that now. All that personal data collected for nothing. Got few extra Twitter followers from dunking on Biden campaign slogan. Lack of politics is a political statement, man.

'Given his unparalleled background in this sector, I am pleased to have Hunter Biden joining the Energy Department as the new Deputy Secretary for the Office of International Affairs,' said Trump, explaining that Biden's long list of contacts with major Eastern European petroleum firms would be indispensable in promoting the administration's interests as they pursue energy contracts abroad. 'Hunter grew up in politics, so he's primed for the job, and he came very highly recommended by several big-time energy executives. He's a really great guy who knows how to get things done in this business. Hunter will start tomorrow, getting right to work securing the best deals possible for the American people.' At press time, Trump nominated Hunter Biden to replace a retiring Rick Perry as energy secretary at the end of the year."
186,So-Called Ronald Reagan Presidential Library Looks Nothing Like Him,"SIMI VALLEY, CA'Declaring the whole visit 'sort of a letdown,' Valley View Middle School student Lucas Hursch, 13, was disappointed to find Monday that the so-called Ronald Reagan Presidential Library bears no resemblance to the man who was the leader of the free world from 1980 to 1988. 'You could maybe argue it has a passing resemblance from some angles, but seriously, that would be quite a stretch,' said the eighth-grader, adding that unless the 40th president had a tiny, marble version of himself inside his own body which he charged a $20 entrance fee to see, the building bearing his name shares no physical characteristics to the actor-turned-politician. 'I assumed we'd get there, enter a giant glass and steel model of Reagan's head, perhaps using The Great Communicator's tongue as a walkway, and have the chance to explore his guts and stuff. But this place has none of that' just a boring building with completely normal doors and windows. I was taught a library is where knowledge is kept, so that kind of should be up in his brain, I guess? Also, you'd think they have it dressed up in a nice suit or something, but the outside is just bricks. If they were going for realism, they did not do a great job.' Hursch noted that the architects and building contractors had no excuse for their shoddy work, as there are thousands of photographs available to aid them in constructing a more realistic replica of the president. "
187,Pete Buttigieg Blames Inability To Disclose Political Stances On NDA With Buttigieg Campaign,"CONCORD, NH'Declaring that he simply has no choice in the matter, White House hopeful Pete Buttigieg told reporters Friday that some political positions he holds cannot be disclosed because of a nondisclosure agreement he signed with the Pete Buttigieg presidential campaign. 'I would love to answer your questions, but back in early 2019, I signed a strict, binding contract with the Pete for America organization in which I agreed not to discuss such matters,' Buttigieg said during a candidate forum, explaining that while he would love to offer more detailed and convincing proposals on issues such as healthcare, foreign policy, and immigration, he is legally prohibited from doing so. 'There's nothing I'd enjoy more than elaborating on my tax plan, for example, but I can't talk about any views I may have held during the period of my candidacy. These are highly confidential policy initiatives. Unless the Buttigieg campaign agrees to release me from the NDA, I'm afraid there's simply nothing I can do.' At press time, the Buttigieg campaign was reportedly scrambling to perform damage control after details of Buttigieg's political stances had been leaked to the public."

'Look, these cuts are not about kicking people off the food stamp rolls, but encouraging them to get off the couch and start looking for thankless, backbreaking work that will be rendered obsolete by either automation or outsourcing by 2025,' said Perdue, adding that the administration's goal wasn't to prevent Americans from affording food, but to create an empowering situation where U.S. citizens could barely have the means for sustenance because their degrading, short-term job, with severe physical and emotional hazards, forces them to work overtime without extra pay. 'We are hoping the new directive will serve as a gentle nudge for Americans to take their lives into their own hands by signing up for one, two, or even three demanding jobs from a hellish megacorporation that only cares about their bottom line. People shouldn't be relying on the government for free food, especially in this current Trump economy'there are tons of available positions that will push the boundaries of their physical and mental health, as well as significantly decrease their life expectancy, all in exchange for a meager subsistence that robs them and their families of their dignity.' Perdue also added that the new rules would work in tandem with the proposed cuts to Medicare, which the administration has argued will incentivize unemployed people to take up jobs that offer inhumane health care plans that don't cover essential services."
191,Boris Johnson Worried Anti-Semitism Accusations Against Labour Party Will Hurt Tories' Hold On Bigot Vote,"LONDON'Monitoring polls and news coverage of the upcoming elections, U.K. prime minister Boris Johnson reportedly expressed concern Thursday that continued accusations of anti-Semitism against the Labour Party will hurt the Tories' hold on the bigot vote. 'Those with prejudiced and discriminatory beliefs have long been a bedrock of the Conservative Party constituency, but I'm nervous that so many people attacking Labour as the party of anti-Semites will eat into our ability to win,' said Johnson, adding that he was concerned the volume of allegations that Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn wasn't doing enough to combat anti-Semitism in his own party could result in bigoted voters believing that Labour actually represented their values. 'When allegations first started coming out, I figured it would be a flash in the pan and the Tories could continue counting on the bigot vote, as we have for generations. It's really going to hurt us if people think Labour is the party for anti-Semitism based on a few things in the media and ignore the political reality, which is that the Conservatives have for decades reliably issued policy driven by prejudice and racial animus. But it's going to be a close election, and I'm worried if this doesn't stop, the Tories could be at risk of losing the Islamaphobe or even the white supremacist vote, and that would be devastating at the polls.' An increasingly desperate Johnson added that he was pondering saying or doing something extremely anti-Semitic in order to remind bigoted voters on the fence about which party best advocated their interests."
192,Jimmy Carter Devotes Rest Of Life To Raising Awareness Of Fact That Men Get UTIs Too,"PLAINS, GA'As he continues to rest and recover following a brush with the ailment earlier this week, former President Jimmy Carter announced Thursday he would spend the remainder of his life educating people about the fact that men, too, routinely suffer from urinary tract infections. 'This isn't just an issue that affects women: Every urethra is delicate and susceptible, with roughly one in 10 men contracting a UTI at some point during their life,' said the 39th president of the United States, confirming he would immediately sever ties with Habitat for Humanity and terminate the Carter Center's long-running program to eradicate Guinea worm disease in order to focus solely on the promotion of healthy male urinary tracts. 'This painful affliction is often misdiagnosed, so if you feel a sharp burning sensation when urinating or notice an unfamiliar discharge in your urine, make sure you get tested. It's nothing to be embarrassed about, and there's no reason to live in discomfort when treatment is readily available. They give you some pills and it clears right up.' At press time, Carter was reportedly going from stall door to stall door in a public men's room, where he urged occupants to reduce their risk of a UTI by drinking plenty of fluids and keeping the tip of their penis clean and dry."

'We are going to have so much fun without you losers,' said the U.S. commander in chief of the impromptu new intergovernmental alliance he formed after proclaiming that 'the old NATO is stupid,' explaining that he had already poured billions of dollars of funding into the collective to ensure they have the 'best summit ever.' 'France and Canada think they're so cool, but we could totally destroy them in a fight. I already met with Qaboos, Stevo, and Dsi, and we're gonna get matching satin jackets and they're gonna look sick.'

'The day she locked me up for marijuana possession, I looked her in the eye and swore I would have my revenge,' said Simmons, rubbing the long scar on his head while staring into the dark, empty room around him and ruminating on how his lifelong quest to destroy Harris's presidential ambitions was finally complete. 'Fifteen years of my life gone'you took them from me Kamala, but it looks like I've had the last laugh. All those lost days in prison, plotting my return, crafting my backstory, studying you for weaknesses, I even joined the army, it's all lead to this.

'I know I don't really need a second campaign, and it hasn't even been that long since I bought my first one, but it's the holidays, and I wanted to do something special for Mikey. It's going to have a full campaign staff available around the clock, and there's even going to be a movie theater in the headquarters where we can watch all my political ads.

'It's not that the shoulder rub thing isn't creepy, it is, but we didn't realize the Pandora's box that we opened by making him stop,' said Loveland, Colorado resident Virginia Dalton, claiming that while Biden smelling a woman's hair had always grossed her out, seeing the 77-year-old biting his wife's finger during a campaign event over the weekend shook her to the core. 'It's fine, just let him do it. Unsolicited shoulder rubs or touching a stranger's lower back are not good, but at least they're kind of normal. There is apparently no hope of him just acting okay, so let's at least give him back the shoulder rubs, because God knows what horrors he will unleash upon women without that outlet.' At press time, the nation's women were hastily promising Biden they would vote for him just so they could escape his advances."
199,Pete Buttigieg Admits Only Recently Realizing Black People Can Vote,"SOUTH BEND, IN'In response to recent criticism of his campaign and political record, Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg admitted Monday that he only recently realized that black people can vote. 'I'll be the first one to acknowledge that I've had some blind spots in my political career, and I've learned some hard truths over the past few months, one of which is that African Americans have been able to vote in this country for decades,' said the mayor of South Bend, IN, apologizing to the city's black residents for his lack of attention to the problems facing their community and his belief that they didn't possess the legal right to cast a ballot for any elected office. 'In the time since I announced my campaign, my eyes have been opened to the realities of this country's systemic racism, and also black suffrage. I realize that some of the things I've done as mayor and said on the campaign trail aren't going to play as well with this constituency, although, to be fair, I've only just realized that they're a constituency. I honestly had no idea. But going forward, my message to black Americans is that I want your vote now that I know that you have one.' Buttigieg added that in order to avoid alienating potential supporters, he would be open to not letting black people vote. "

'I assumed we'd get there, enter a giant glass and steel model of Reagan's head, perhaps using The Great Communicator's tongue as a walkway, and have the chance to explore his guts and stuff. But this place has none of that' just a boring building with completely normal doors and windows. I was taught a library is where knowledge is kept, so that kind of should be up in his brain, I guess? Also, you'd think they have it dressed up in a nice suit or something, but the outside is just bricks. If they were going for realism, they did not do a great job.' Hursch noted that the architects and building contractors had no excuse for their shoddy work, as there are thousands of photographs available to aid them in constructing a more realistic replica of the president.

207,Pete Buttigieg Blames Inability To Disclose Political Stances On NDA With Buttigieg Campaign,"CONCORD, NH'Declaring that he simply has no choice in the matter, White House hopeful Pete Buttigieg told reporters Friday that some political positions he holds cannot be disclosed because of a nondisclosure agreement he signed with the Pete Buttigieg presidential campaign. 'I would love to answer your questions, but back in early 2019, I signed a strict, binding contract with the Pete for America organization in which I agreed not to discuss such matters,' Buttigieg said during a candidate forum, explaining that while he would love to offer more detailed and convincing proposals on issues such as healthcare, foreign policy, and immigration, he is legally prohibited from doing so. 'There's nothing I'd enjoy more than elaborating on my tax plan, for example, but I can't talk about any views I may have held during the period of my candidacy. These are highly confidential policy initiatives. Unless the Buttigieg campaign agrees to release me from the NDA, I'm afraid there's simply nothing I can do.' At press time, the Buttigieg campaign was reportedly scrambling to perform damage control after details of Buttigieg's political stances had been leaked to the public."

210,Sonny Perdue Argues Food Stamp Cuts Will Incentivize People To Get Exploitative Jobs That Won't Exist In 5 Years,"WASHINGTON'Responding to the criticism surrounding the Trump administration's recent decision to tighten restrictions on supplemental nutrition eligibility, Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue argued Thursday that the food stamp cuts will incentivize people to go out and get exploitative jobs that won't exist in five years. 'Look, these cuts are not about kicking people off the food stamp rolls, but encouraging them to get off the couch and start looking for thankless, backbreaking work that will be rendered obsolete by either automation or outsourcing by 2025,' said Perdue, adding that the administration's goal wasn't to prevent Americans from affording food, but to create an empowering situation where U.S. citizens could barely have the means for sustenance because their degrading, short-term job, with severe physical and emotional hazards, forces them to work overtime without extra pay. 'We are hoping the new directive will serve as a gentle nudge for Americans to take their lives into their own hands by signing up for one, two, or even three demanding jobs from a hellish megacorporation that only cares about their bottom line. People shouldn't be relying on the government for free food, especially in this current Trump economy'there are tons of available positions that will push the boundaries of their physical and mental health, as well as significantly decrease their life expectancy, all in exchange for a meager subsistence that robs them and their families of their dignity.' Perdue also added that the new rules would work in tandem with the proposed cuts to Medicare, which the administration has argued will incentivize unemployed people to take up jobs that offer inhumane health care plans that don't cover essential services."
211,Boris Johnson Worried Anti-Semitism Accusations Against Labour Party Will Hurt Tories' Hold On Bigot Vote,"LONDON'Monitoring polls and news coverage of the upcoming elections, U.K. prime minister Boris Johnson reportedly expressed concern Thursday that continued accusations of anti-Semitism against the Labour Party will hurt the Tories' hold on the bigot vote. 'Those with prejudiced and discriminatory beliefs have long been a bedrock of the Conservative Party constituency, but I'm nervous that so many people attacking Labour as the party of anti-Semites will eat into our ability to win,' said Johnson, adding that he was concerned the volume of allegations that Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn wasn't doing enough to combat anti-Semitism in his own party could result in bigoted voters believing that Labour actually represented their values. 'When allegations first started coming out, I figured it would be a flash in the pan and the Tories could continue counting on the bigot vote, as we have for generations. It's really going to hurt us if people think Labour is the party for anti-Semitism based on a few things in the media and ignore the political reality, which is that the Conservatives have for decades reliably issued policy driven by prejudice and racial animus. But it's going to be a close election, and I'm worried if this doesn't stop, the Tories could be at risk of losing the Islamaphobe or even the white supremacist vote, and that would be devastating at the polls.' An increasingly desperate Johnson added that he was pondering saying or doing something extremely anti-Semitic in order to remind bigoted voters on the fence about which party best advocated their interests."
212,Jimmy Carter Devotes Rest Of Life To Raising Awareness Of Fact That Men Get UTIs Too,"PLAINS, GA'As he continues to rest and recover following a brush with the ailment earlier this week, former President Jimmy Carter announced Thursday he would spend the remainder of his life educating people about the fact that men, too, routinely suffer from urinary tract infections. 'This isn't just an issue that affects women: Every urethra is delicate and susceptible, with roughly one in 10 men contracting a UTI at some point during their life,' said the 39th president of the United States, confirming he would immediately sever ties with Habitat for Humanity and terminate the Carter Center's long-running program to eradicate Guinea worm disease in order to focus solely on the promotion of healthy male urinary tracts. 'This painful affliction is often misdiagnosed, so if you feel a sharp burning sensation when urinating or notice an unfamiliar discharge in your urine, make sure you get tested. It's nothing to be embarrassed about, and there's no reason to live in discomfort when treatment is readily available. They give you some pills and it clears right up.' At press time, Carter was reportedly going from stall door to stall door in a public men's room, where he urged occupants to reduce their risk of a UTI by drinking plenty of fluids and keeping the tip of their penis clean and dry."

'We are going to have so much fun without you losers,' said the U.S. commander in chief of the impromptu new intergovernmental alliance he formed after proclaiming that 'the old NATO is stupid,' explaining that he had already poured billions of dollars of funding into the collective to ensure they have the 'best summit ever.' 'France and Canada think they're so cool, but we could totally destroy them in a fight. I already met with Qaboos, Stevo, and Dsi, and we're gonna get matching satin jackets and they're gonna look sick.' At press time, Trump was already threatening to pull out of his newly formed alliance after accusing its members of not paying their fair share of the budget."

'The day she locked me up for marijuana possession, I looked her in the eye and swore I would have my revenge,' said Simmons, rubbing the long scar on his head while staring into the dark, empty room around him and ruminating on how his lifelong quest to destroy Harris's presidential ambitions was finally complete. 'Fifteen years of my life gone'you took them from me Kamala, but it looks like I've had the last laugh. All those lost days in prison, plotting my return, crafting my backstory, studying you for weaknesses, I even joined the army, it's all lead to this. You thought you were tough, you thought you had destroyed me, but your chickens have come home to roost. He nani, Kamala.'

'Having one presidential campaign is nice and all, but I had some extra money lying around and decided to splurge on another first-class presidential campaign with all the bells and whistles,' said Bloomberg, adding that he planned to split time between his original campaign and his new luxury one, for which he'd already gotten the most expensive consultants, most luxurious campaign vehicles, and nicest website money can buy. 'I know I don't really need a second campaign, and it hasn't even been that long since I bought my first one, but it's the holidays, and I wanted to do something special for Mikey. It's going to have a full campaign staff available around the clock, and there's even going to be a movie theater in the headquarters where we can watch all my political ads. Voters are going to be blown away when they see it.' Bloomberg told reporters that he was also scouting sites for an additional international presidential campaign in a more exotic locale."
218,Nation Calls For Letting Biden Rub Women's Shoulders Again After Seeing What He'll Do Instead,"WASHINGTON'Apologizing for what they have unleashed by condemning the former Vice President's past behavior, the U.S. populace issued a call Monday to let Joe Biden rub women's shoulders again after seeing what he will do instead. 'It's not that the shoulder rub thing isn't creepy, it is, but we didn't realize the Pandora's box that we opened by making him stop,' said Loveland, Colorado resident Virginia Dalton, claiming that while Biden smelling a woman's hair had always grossed her out, seeing the 77-year-old biting his wife's finger during a campaign event over the weekend shook her to the core. 'It's fine, just let him do it. Unsolicited shoulder rubs or touching a stranger's lower back are not good, but at least they're kind of normal. There is apparently no hope of him just acting okay, so let's at least give him back the shoulder rubs, because God knows what horrors he will unleash upon women without that outlet.' At press time, the nation's women were hastily promising Biden they would vote for him just so they could escape his advances."
219,Pete Buttigieg Admits Only Recently Realizing Black People Can Vote,"SOUTH BEND, IN'In response to recent criticism of his campaign and political record, Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg admitted Monday that he only recently realized that black people can vote. 'I'll be the first one to acknowledge that I've had some blind spots in my political career, and I've learned some hard truths over the past few months, one of which is that African Americans have been able to vote in this country for decades,' said the mayor of South Bend, IN, apologizing to the city's black residents for his lack of attention to the problems facing their community and his belief that they didn't possess the legal right to cast a ballot for any elected office. 'In the time since I announced my campaign, my eyes have been opened to the realities of this country's systemic racism, and also black suffrage. I realize that some of the things I've done as mayor and said on the campaign trail aren't going to play as well with this constituency, although, to be fair, I've only just realized that they're a constituency. I honestly had no idea. But going forward, my message to black Americans is that I want your vote now that I know that you have one.' Buttigieg added that in order to avoid alienating potential supporters, he would be open to not letting black people vote. "

'What was that? Oh, sure, I could spare some change,' said Thompson, who, presuming the young Buttigieg canvasser speaking to him must represent a charity of some kind, fished into his pocket for the $1.17 worth of currency that would cause him to skyrocket to the top of the South Bend, IN mayor's list of African American contributors. 'I know that's a lot of dimes, hope that's okay. Oh, whoops, sorry about that paperclip in there! Ha, ha. No'no, I'm not interested in a pamphlet, but thanks anyway. I have to go now, all right? You have a good day.' At press time, sources confirmed Thompson was unaware his image was now prominently featured on the page of Buttigieg's website touting the candidate's plan to empower black America."

'You can do this, just think pious thoughts and you'll be halfway to Heaven long before they can uncover anything else,' said Pence, tightly clenching his hands in prayer while bobbing up and down on the balls of his feet in a reported attempt to jump-start the salvation process. 'Okay, here we go. I'm going to close my eyes, and when I open them, I'll be bathed in a glorious white light and begin floating up in the air'far, far away from Congress and any accusations about knowledge of a quid pro quo.

The criminal computer system that was solely responsible for fabricating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election was reportedly chuckling to itself, remembering how it had duped everyone by spending months under an assumed identity as a Pentium Pro in Morocco, as beautiful, scantily clad women fanned it with palm leaves and massaged its circuits with the finest cotton swabs. At press time, the grinning server had stood up from its beach chair to embrace its old friend Hillary Clinton as she stepped onto the deck."

'It would have been nice if someone from the Buttigieg team had reached out to me before they plastered my face all over these mailers,' said Booker, flipping through a brochure featuring numerous photos of the New Jersey senator giving a thumbs-up and shaking hands with Buttigieg. 'I like Pete fine and everything, and we've gotten to know each other a bit on the campaign trail, but we're certainly not as close as these flyers make it seem. In any case, I do worry that seeing my picture scores of times under headings like, 'It's time for a new generation of American leadership,' could send the wrong message about who I'm supporting in the primary.'

231,Biggest Revelations From The Anonymous Trump Official's New Book,"A Warning, the new book by an anonymous writer identified as 'a senior Trump administration official' that purports to be a critical look at the Donald Trump presidency, was published November 19. The Onion takes a look at the biggest revelations from the anonymous official's new book. Trump fails to hide his character weaknesses and lack of intellectual acumen as adeptly as past presidents. Several senior administration officials considered resigning en masse in 2018 to protest Trump's behavior, but decided to wait for a time when it also wouldn't make a difference. The White House has only one bathroom. Frequent unrelated asides explaining how it's a good idea for the U.S. to go to war with Iran. Trump's animosity toward the Federal Reserve stems from a fundamental disagreement over the nature of monetary policy, as his own research into the new classical model confirms a hypothesis that business growth is not substantially affected by central bank activity. One time the author saw two Barrons playing cards with each other. GOP officials are willing to replace Trump as 2020 candidate if it ever seems like the Democrats are serious about competing. The main reason Trump's critics have been unable to persuade his supporters to abandon him is because they haven't quoted Cicero enough. Print still pretty profitable if you know how to play your cards right. Stephen Miller meets with Dracula in the confusing epilogue setting up the sequel."

'Whether you're more of a centrist white person or a fiscally conservative one, all whites have a home in the Buttigieg campaign. You can rest assured knowing that we've received no endorsement from the NAACP or any minority organizations. For the most part, black voters don't even know who I am.

Elderly veteran told lunch not happening till he gives director right fucking take. Local bald eagle guy gets a call. Hundreds of takes to get candidate to appear casual and down to earth.

'President Trump and his allies conducted a smear campaign against me knowing I would refuse to participate in advancing illegal activities on their behalf, though I totally understand if you don't give a shit because that's just the way things work now and nothing matters,' said Yovanovitch, who stated that while she found Trump's actions 'shocking' and 'unprecedented,' lawmakers were free to cut her off at any time so that they could all go back to wallowing in the sense of meaninglessness that has come to permeate American life. 'This has never really happened in the history of the modern presidency, but I can sympathize if you're shrugging it off'I'm shrugging it off, too. Even if we do prove the president is guilty of high crimes, so what? It's not like there are rules anymore. Frankly, I was surprised that I was called to testify at all.'

According to the released call logs, President Trump responded to Zelensky's appeals for further cooperation between the two countries by hitting nine and then star 30 times in a row while yelling 'Ukraine!' into the phone. This was reportedly followed by an eight-minute exchange where the president repeatedly held down the entire keypad in an attempt to hang up the phone. In addition, several pages of the transcript document noted rapid fire dialing as Trump muttered about not knowing how to spell Ukraine with numbers. At press time, legal analysts going over the call were expressing the most interest in the final five minutes, where President Trump attempts to order a meat lovers pizza and cinnamon sticks from Domino's before launching into a six-minute diatribe about how someone with President Zelensky's thick accent shouldn't be working at a pizza place."

'We hope the masterminds behind the hearing have some real surprises in store, otherwise I don't see this ever perking up to three or four Andrew Johnsons,' said Jennings, noting that audiences who tuned in to the congressional proceedings looking for a thriller would find themselves facing more of a plodding slice-of-life drama. 'They had the perfect opportunity in the third hour for a dramatic moment, but they totally blew it. If someone had produced a phone in a Ziploc bag, we would have bumped our rating up half of a Johnson for sure; however, it looks like the creators weren't interested in taking risks.

'We're proud to announce that we have reached a debt-based deal with the Buttigieg campaign to bring their considerable war chest and great polling numbers into our fold,' said campaign spokesman Greg Ryans, adding that the reported $250 million buyout 'perfectly aligned' with the Patrick campaign's vision of attaining high polling in early caucus states, rapidly accelerating grassroots organization, and widening its donation base before the end of Q4. 'Sadly, we did have to lay off 30% of the Buttigieg campaign due to redundancies, including Pete himself. But we were impressed enough to keep on Chasten Buttigieg in his current role at campaign rallies. With the assets from liquidating Amy Klobuchar's campaign, we're easily on track to be a presidential frontrunner by early 2020.' Ryans also noted that the Patrick campaign would strategically shed the gay rights plank of Buttigieg's platforms after it proved distasteful to potential campaign investors."

'Remember, it's not a real woman. It's just a piece of metal like any other doorknob. Just take a deep breath and don't throw up.'

The Onion provides tips for testifying to Congress. Don't be too eager to say yes to the first congressional hearing you're asked to speak at'it's better if you wait for the right one to come along. Start off with a light joke, like 'Is this water, or truth serum?' A calm, respectful demeanor is absolutely crucial unless you're a Supreme Court nominee. Remember, you only get three 'passes' during questioning. Iowa congresswoman Abby Finkenauer is going to carve you up. Nothing you can do about it. Do not be the chairman and CEO of Facebook. Have some pieces of deli meat in your pocket to keep your energy up. Tell the truth unless someone who can pardon you wants you to lie. While it is the congressman's job to flirt with you, it doesn't mean they actually like you. No matter what happens, take solace that Congress never actually doles out consequences."

'Despite the escalation of the inquiry in recent weeks, impeachment has the backing of less than 1% of people who have never encountered Western-style democracy and live in small, remote tribes hidden deep in the rainforest,' said Reuters poll analyst Chris Kahn, explaining that a month of depositions 'hasn't moved the needle at all' among indigenous hunter-gatherers entirely unfamiliar with our nation, its leaders, and its constitutional precedents. 'This is a huge problem for Democrats. Go into these totally isolated communities that exhibit only a loose form of what we would call political structure, and you won't find anyone demanding impeachment. Talk to individuals who possess no concept of a social contract in which the state exists solely to serve the will of the people, and none of them will tell you Donald Trump should be removed from office. It's that simple.' Kahn went on to remark that if Democrats wanted these numbers to change, they would have to begin by reaching out to people and presenting them with evidence that the United States exists."
251,"Hey You, Want To Be A Federal Judge?' Says Mitch McConnell Pointing To Valet In Heritage Foundation Parking Lot","WASHINGTON'After realizing there were still judicial appointments that needed to be filled during a meeting with the conservative think tank, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reportedly pointed to a valet in the Heritage Foundation parking lot Thursday and asked him if he wanted to be a federal judge. 'Hey, kid, how'd you like a lifetime appointment on the Ninth Circuit, huh?' asked McConnell, interrupting the 19-year-old temp worker's protests that he didn't know anything about the law to tell him that all he needed was 'wipe that dumb look off your face' and he could be delivering rulings by the end of the week. 'You over 18? You got an ID? That'll do. Now just hop in this car with me and we'll head over to the Capitol right now. Remember, abortion's bad, corporations are good, and as for everything else, you just shut the fuck up and do as your told. Got it?' At press time, after the valet nervously informed McConnell that he was hungover and had illegal drugs in his system, the laughing Senate leader assured him that wouldn't be an issue."

Says Exhausted Trump Turning On News To See What Bullshit Thing President Did Today","WASHINGTON'Bemoaning the never-ending stream of news about the current occupant of the Oval Office, an exhausted President Donald Trump reportedly asked himself, 'Oh Jesus, now what?' after turning the TV Wednesday and seeing what bullshit thing the president had done this time. 'Just a single day without this garbage would be nice, but with this administration, there's always something, isn't there?' said Trump, who groaned that everywhere he looked'the television, the newspaper, even his Twitter feed'he was confronted with yet another fucking insane story about the president. 'No matter how hard I try, I can't seem to escape that asshole. Every day I ask myself, 'When will it all end?' Because it's seriously becoming more than I can handle.' At press time, Trump was overheard mumbling to himself that with his luck, he'll probably wind up having to put up with this horseshit for another four years."
253,Vindman Says Ukraine Transcript Left Out Lengthy Sections Of Trump Bragging About Time He Was In Pizza Hut Commercial,"WASHINGTON'Raising further questions about Donald Trump's July call to Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky, national security expert Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman testified Tuesday that the White House's transcript of the conversation left out lengthy sections of Trump bragging about the time he was in a commercial for Pizza Hut. 'When I saw there were numerous gaps in the official record of the call, I sought to add in the president's lengthy explanation about how professional the production team had been and how some of the most classic moments in the ad were actually lines that he had improvised on set, but I was ultimately rebuffed,' said Vindman, telling House impeachment investigators that several ellipses in the call summary covered remarks about how Trump was a major force in making the stuffed-crust pizza one of America's most popular fast food items, and that people still regularly approach him to compliment his acting skills in the ad. 'I did not think it was proper for the president to ask another country's leader to queue up a YouTube video of the advertisement so he could walk him through it moment by moment. In addition, while it is not reflected in the call summary, there was an explicit mention by Zelensky about the palpable chemistry the president had with Ivana Trump, even while they were in the midst of a divorce.' Vindman also testified that the transcript had been stored in a top-secret computer system along with records of other communications with foreign leaders, including a phone call with Chinese president Xi Jinping in which Trump spoke for over an hour about meeting Grimace during a 2002 McDonald's commercial.

'This damning footage shows Sen. Sanders clandestinely mingling with thousands of representatives from the nursing, food service, and public education sectors, many of whom were apparently chauffeured to the event aboard city buses and enjoyed fountain drinks upon arriving,' said political strategist August Buckminster, adding that the event, which reportedly took place at a local vocational school, could prove problematic for the presidential candidate in his bid for the Democratic nomination. 'Sanders can be heard promising a highly underprivileged audience everything from a minimum-wage increase to healthcare access to educational opportunities'whatever it takes to get them on his side. In one video, he explicitly offers a group of steel workers a quid pro quo of affordable housing in exchange for their votes. If the senator wants to win the backing of the national party, he will certainly have to answer for hobnobbing with this room full of people at the absolute lowest levels of power.' At press time, Sanders had received further criticism after documents were uncovered showing he has acted on behalf of a contingent of approximately 625,000 Vermont residents over a period of nearly 30 years."

'Show me one more time! One more time, please?' said a visibly gleeful Trump, who according to sources became sullen, pounded on his desk, and threw a paperweight at acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney when the adviser gently suggested it was time to move on to other items on the president's daily agenda. 'I'm not going to any stupid meetings. I want to watch my show again. I love it, I love it, I love it! Fast-forward to the part with the big boom!' At press time, reports confirmed Trump was demanding that Pentagon officials make more videos of people dying for him to watch."

'Why would they do that? It's so mean,' said Trump, adding that when they stood up in their box seats to wave, the crowd began viciously booing Melania, an act he claimed was extremely disrespectful to the office of the first lady, especially since he was pretty sure she hadn't done anything illegal. 'Listen, there are plenty of things about Melania that I don't like. I've definitely thought about replacing her. Heck, I got caught up in the chant for a little bit there too. But she should be able to attend a baseball game in peace. Someone even pulled out a sign that said 'Impeach Trump,' which is silly, because I don't think she can be impeached. Overall, we were incredibly embarrassed for Melania, but she was able to put on a brave face. I went over to console her and she didn't seem bothered by it at all.' At press time, Trump kicked himself for being foolish after realizing that the crowd was probably booing Senator David Perdue (R-GA) for his unpopular agricultural policies."

Lindsey Graham (R-SC) into their meeting Friday after it became clear he had come to storm the room all by himself. 'We figured it wouldn't hurt to let just one more person in, and to be honest, we all felt pretty bad for the sad sack,' said House Foreign Affairs Committee chair Eliot Engel, who added that aides had spotted the lone senator outside the Capitol's Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility struggling to set up a Facebook livestream and checking the batteries in a bullhorn he couldn't get to work. 'You could hear him out there rehearsing his little speech to himself over and over right before he ran up and knocked on the door. When we opened it, he started sputtering and sweating and couldn't get any words out, so after a while [Rep.] Ted [Deutch] just said, 'Hey, Lindsey, you can come in. It's fine.' He sat down and mumbled something about how three or four other Republicans had told him they might be showing up later to join his protest, but no one ever did.' According to sources, Graham later announced he had more important places to be and accidentally exited through the wrong door, finding himself in a broom closet where, to avoid further embarrassment, he stayed quiet and perfectly still through the remaining six hours of the hearing."

'Come on, guys, wasn't that fun when I got in that really huge truck or did that photo op with the taco bowl?' said the 45th commander in chief of the halcyon days when he was attacked by a bald eagle, insulted the appearance of Ted Cruz's wife, or threw paper towels to Puerto Rico rescue workers, spiraling into an ever-deeper panic as he realized the gravity of the investigation into his diplomatic misdeeds in Ukraine. 'I feel like everybody is just focusing on the negative here. Don't forget, we've had a lot of great laughs together, like when that lawn mower kid came to the White House or when I looked up at a solar eclipse without the glasses. Boy, wasn't that a real hoot? I mean, how can you not remember the fast food banquet, or when my butt looked big in that one picture? Doesn't that count for anything? That was classic Trump.' At press time, the American public sighed deeply in fond remembrance of all the good times they'd shared together as support for impeachment dropped to 0%."

'On the one hand, there is just too much bird seed missing each morning to be attributable to birds alone, and on the other, there are a few suspicious squirrels who have been skulking around the yard lately'I think there's some collusion afoot, but right now, it's impossible to prove,' said the unshaven former FBI director, showing reporters how he had propped up several camcorders on his windowsill to film the squirrels when he wasn't watching the animals through binoculars from under a canoe he'd flipped over in the corner of his yard. 'I thought I had them the other night when the automatic light went on beside the garage, but by the time I got down there, the birdseed was gone. I followed the trail for a while, but it was raining and I lost the scent. There was a late-night meeting a few days ago between a possum and a raccoon I think might be germane to the case, but I don't want to leap to any conclusions. I haven't seen the raccoon interact with the squirrels yet, which makes me think there's some go-between critter I haven't identified. It's a big question mark on the board I've got inside. They're wily'they're trying to play 12-step chess. Fortunately, though, I've got some experience playing that game. And I've got all the time in the world ever since I cleared up that inquiry into why the begonias kept getting trampled and also since my wife left me.' At press time, a frantic, wild-eyed Mueller had burst into FBI headquarters and demanded someone help him file a subpoena to get access to the inside of a tree where he suspected the squirrels were storing the stolen birdseed."

'The U.S. has turned against me, so it's time for me to float off to some distant land,' said the president, crouching next to a balustrade on the White House roof and blowing air into balloon after balloon. 'All right, Mick [Mulvaney], time for you to jump out the window to lighten the load. Just a few thousand more and I'll be aloft. If the wind holds, I should make it to Saudi Arabia by morning. Farewell! On to my next great adventure!' At press time, dozens of House GOP members were holding a press conference outside the White House to describe how beautiful and majestic the president looked flying through the air. "

'Everyone's getting on his case all the time'Goofus has been treated very, very unfairly,' said Trump, decrying the 60-year-old children's magazine's obvious pro-Gallant agenda while praising Goofus as a bright kid smart enough to look out for number one and who knew how to cut a deal. ''Gross Gallant' is no angel either! I hear he's in bed with some pretty shady figures, I won't say who. Too bad for Highlights, a once-great publication that has gone downhill in recent years. Unfair that they never publish your drawings when you submit them. Also, I looked at that scene of the kids playing, and the second picture? No differences! None at all! And I was in that terrible maze for hours. Not good. There was clearly no exit.' At press time, Trump had reversed his position and instructed an aide to renew the White House's subscription after discovering Highlights gave him some positive press by mentioning him in a list of U.S. presidents."
268,Secret Service Opens Fire On Section Of Slippery Floor That Attempted To Take Out President Carter,"PLAINS, GA'Responding with deadly force to a threat that left the 39th president of the United States in the hospital, Secret Service agents confirmed they opened fire Monday evening on an expanse of slippery flooring that had made an attempt on the life of Jimmy Carter in his own home. 'It's unclear how a hostile patch of slick tile managed to get so close to President Carter, but upon identifying the wet spot that caused him to fall, we immediately began shooting,' said agent Joseph Pena, who according to federal officials put his own safety on the line, heroically throwing himself atop what appeared to be a juice spill to prevent it from doing any more harm to the 95-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner. 'In the heat of the altercation, there were unfortunately some casualties, with an innocent table lamp lost after taking friendly fire. We are proud to report, however, that the tile that wounded President Carter has been permanently neutralized and no longer poses any danger.' In response to the incident, the Secret Service has reportedly added personnel to Carter's security detail, assigning separate agents to individually patrol every surface of the former president's home."
269,Trump Apologizes For Impeachment Comment After Learning Disturbing History Of 1918 Lynching Of German American Immigrant Robert Prager,"WASHINGTON'Acknowledging the hurt he had caused, President Donald Trump apologized Tuesday for describing the House impeachment inquiry as a 'lynching,' saying he had been unaware of the term's association with the 1918 murder of Robert Prager, a German American immigrant killed by an angry mob. 'I realize now my remark was insensitive, and insulting to the memory of Mr. Prager and those impacted by his tragic death,' said the president, who asked the American people to forgive him, emphasizing how disturbed he had been when a member of his staff told him how Prager had been singled out and killed by coal miners in Illinois during a wartime wave of anti-German sentiment. 'Upon learning of this foul act, I have come to understand that lynching represents a deeply troubling chapter in our nation's past. Going forward, we must make a greater effort to reckon with this difficult part of our history, by which I mean specifically the terrible fate that befell an innocent German man on April 5, 1918. I am truly sorry for any pain my statement may have caused the German American community.' At press time, sources confirmed Trump's base appeared satisfied with his apology and had no objections to a new tweet in which he compared the impeachment inquiry to 'the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.'"

'I like Tulsi, but when we talk, everything's all about her, as if she's the only person in the world with problems,' said Assad, adding that it would be nice if once in a while Rep. Gabbard asked how his family or his 8-year-old civil war was going instead of whining about how she continues to trail Sen. Kamala Harris in New Hampshire. 'Now there's this whole thing with Hillary Clinton, and believe me, I've had my own problems with Hillary, but you don't hear me droning on and on about her all the time. At least when [Russian President Vladimir] Putin or [Iran's Supreme Leader Ali] Khamenei call, they ask me how I've been. Tulsi, meanwhile, begins every other sentence with 'When I'm president,' and I don't know how to tell her that's just not something that's going to happen for her.' At press time, sources confirmed Assad had put Gabbard on speaker so he could sign off on a few sarin gas attacks while occasionally punctuating the conversation with 'Totally' or 'Wow, that's crazy.'"

'Good luck catching me as I disappear like a ghost in the wind'ha, ha, you can't catch someone who never existed!

'Early on, I thought it was definitely going to be Biden, but a lot of other candidates made great points about why they needed to be killed to save America, so I was really torn,' said Brimhall, who claimed hearing Bernie Sanders' arguments for universal healthcare put him at the top of his list for a few months. 'I was actually flirting with Andrew Yang for a bit'his freedom dividend seems like exactly the kind of idea I need to cleanse from the face of the Earth, but there wasn't much beyond that. I'm honestly leaning towards Warren now. She has a lot of proposals, and her fire during the debate really stood out as something I would want to destroy. Plus, I like that she's a woman.' Brimhall added that we would probably hold off making his final decision until after President Trump singles one out as an enemy of America."

'I've spent 50 years worrying about money, but now I realize that fair wages and housing are not really important'it's people and relationships, it's living in this moment right now,' said Sanders, who admitted that recovering from his surgery provided an opportunity to think about how true wealth and power does not come from money; it comes from having a devoted family. 'I encourage my supporters to forget about all that nonsense about income inequality. I was all 'jobs, jobs, jobs.' Why was I so obsessed with work and material wellbeing? I wanted a wealth tax, but you can't put a dollar value on a sunset. Money for college won't buy you a baby's smile.

'I mean, seriously? It's a few weeks before Halloween and no one even thought to dress up as the Wolfman or something?

'When I received a position in the Biden family, I was obviously afforded a great deal of power and opportunity, and all that opulence got the better of me. When you're in that deep, sometimes you don't see how bad things really are. I understand that I'm under more scrutiny that most people, and to be publicly involved with the Biden family gives the appearance that I've done things the American people wouldn't approve of. I take full responsibility for my involvement with the Bidens, and I'm sorry.' Hunter added that he sought to rise above any further scrutiny by announcing that he was stepping down from the Biden family"

'This is the way Americans were meant to live,' President Trump reportedly said as he looked out across the isolated encampment and used tactical hand signals to communicate with his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, who manned a sniper post in a nearby pine tree. 'As a sovereign citizen, I am not subject to government authority, and it is only here in these hills that I can truly be free. We generate our own electricity, and my aides set up this whole system for collecting and purifying water.

286,Timeline Of The GOP's Relationship With Trump,"The initiation of impeachment proceedings by House Democrats has renewed calls for more Republican leaders to publicly stand up to Trump, as well as driven his most vocal supporters to double down, amid what has been a turbulent relationship between Trump and the party he leads. The Onion looks back at the timeline of Trump and the GOP since he declared his presidential candidacy. GOP thinks it's pretty neat the way Trump attacks President Obama and questions his birth certificate and status as an American. RNC chair Reince Priebus forces then-candidate Trump to sign loyalty pledge, firmly cementing the power dynamic in their relationship. An open letter from 120 conservative foreign policy and national security leaders condemns Trump as fundamentally dishonest and the ideal candidate for the presidency. Speaking at the Republican National Convention, Senator Ted Cruz urges conservatives to 'vote their conscience,' which they do. Trump's election causes GOP leaders' worst impulses to be realized. President Trump feels disrespected after Senator John McCain chooses to die in a hospital instead of any one of the many beautiful Trump hotels and resorts. Senator Mitt Romney criticizes Trump's national emergency on the border in an effort to remind Americans that he still exists. Former Congressman Joe Walsh announces run for 2020 GOP nomination, vowing to bring the right kind of anti-Muslim rhetoric back to the White House. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announces impeachment inquiry against Trump, and GOP lawmakers fully stand by whatever scenario will keep them in office. In a stunning rebuke, Senator Marco Rubio sighs deeply before explaining how this is all perfectly normal."
