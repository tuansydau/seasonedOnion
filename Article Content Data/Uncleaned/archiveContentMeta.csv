1,Weather Map,"WASHINGTON' With its vote to adopt a resolution denouncing the freshman' s congresswoman behavior, the House of Representatives formally censured Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Friday for employing the sexist slur ' fucking bitch'  in a speech on the House floor the day prior. ' The representative from New York' s 14th District is hereby condemned for her unapologetic enunciation of these hateful, abusive words, which not only brought disgrace to this esteemed body but were incredibly demeaning to all womankind,'  House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said as he read aloud the official rebuke, adding that as a woman herself, Ocasio-Cortez should have known better than to speak aloud the unconscionable term, let alone read it into the Congressional Record. ' Her appalling speech of July 23 does not reflect the values of the United States Congress, nor does it reflect the example we wish to set for our children' especially our daughters. While this body will not ask what prompted her to adopt such unprofessional language, it will require the representative to issue an immediate apology to her colleagues or face further disciplinary action for her misconduct.'  In his own words, McCarthy went on to observe that it was too soon to tell just how far back Ocasio-Cortez had set ' young ladies'  in Congress with her ' hysterical'  outburst.","archive, weather, graphical feature, vol 29 issue 13, the onion"

3,Ask a Slaughterhouse Killing Floor Worker,"Dear Slaughterhouse Killing Floor Worker: My wife and I recently moved from Florida to Minnesota, where I was offered a much better job. Problem is, she hates everything about Minnesota. Am I being cruel or is she just being stubborn? ' Stumped in St. Paul Dear Stumped, A cow' s skull is remarkably thick, so you' ve got to give it a terrific wallop. In the old days we' d use a cast iron mallet, but it' s hard to deliver a home-run swing all day long. I recommend a modern pnuematic bolt gun for both ease of use and efficient kill-through ratios. Remember, though, any method will still cover the floor with blood and brains, so keep those non-skid boots. Dear Slaughterhouse Killing Floor Worker: I' m 34 and still looking for that one special guy. I' ve tried everything from the produce aisle to the bar scene to church, but I keep coming up with duds. My friend swears by singles cruises. What do you think? ' Lonely in Lawrenceville Dear Lonely, Meat gobbets and sharp bone fragments are definitely a concern. Find the highest quality eye protection you can find, and wear it from the moment you set foot on the floor. If you' re going to be gutting or flensing, thigh-high rubber boots and thick aprons are a necessity. But unfortunately, when rendering hogfat into lard, they' re also an invitation to heatstroke. If in doubt, ask your line supervisor. Dear Slaughterhouse Killing Floor Worker: My last boyfriend misses my dog Robby terribly and comes to visit him whenever he' s around. It' s getting on my nerves. How do I tell him to give me and Robby some space? ' Cute Pooch in Baton Rouge Dear Cute Pooch, Try as you may, you' re never going to keep all the smaller particles of hair, bone, gristle, and assorted effluvia from getting into your meats.

4,Local Merchant 'Sane Freddie' Driven Out of Business,"Unable to Compete With New Breed of Insane Retailers SCHAUMBURG, IL' A era in discount merchandising came to an end Sunday, when the last of the famed Sane Freddie' s electronics stores closed its doors, a victim of what one industry analyst termed ' the trend toward psychosis in American retail.'  ' I am a reasonable human being with reasonable prices,'  said Frederick ' Sane Freddie'  Klein. ' My competitors, on the other hand, are insane. I can no longer compete. A Panasonic XBS-2000 CD boom box with detachable speakers and MegaBass for $129? That' s pure madness. A Magnavox 19-inch TV with SurroundSound for $199? Utter insanity.'  Klein, 43, built an audio and video empire and became a familiar figure on television with his promises of ' rational prices and lucid service.'  Customers had long marvelled at his ability to keep his head about him and control his temper, even during the enormously hectic holiday shopping season. ' His stores were models of moral and intellectual stability,'  said Frances Noonan, a long-time friend and customer of Klein' s. ' Whether I was buying a new Aiwa-brand 300-watt stereo or just a few 12-packs of Duracell AA batteries, everyone who worked there was consistently coherent. '  Those familiar with the retail industry say there is no longer room for merchandisers such as Klein in an era dominated by schizophrenic, paranoid and utterly delirious entrepreneurs. ' This was inevitable,'  said Douglas Lehman of The Wall Street Journal. ' If you look around the business landscape right now, the big retailers are Schizophrenic Johnny' s, Mentally Ill Nate' s, and Electronics Gone Completely Awry. These places are owned and staffed by the certifiably insane, and their prices are so low they reflect a profound loss of contact with reality.'  Reaction among Klein' s competitors was mixed. ' Bat-shit Freaking Insane'  Johnny Petrocelli, whose self-named string of electronics stores recently opened its 200th outlet, gloated over the business demise of the man he said had ' installed the transmitting bug in my ear that sends my thoughts to the head of the CIA.'  Offering kinder words was kitchen appliance tycoon ' Nutty'  Nate Roberts, one of whose 13 separate personalities, ' Victor,'  praised Klein as ' my Daddy.'  Electronics is but one of many industries being revolutionized by the current demand for mental illness in business. $45 million was made last year by Psychopathia Sexualis Mufflers, an automotive-supply store founded jointly by 15 patients of the California Home for the Criminally Insane.","local, archive, news, vol 29 issue 24, local"
5,Pet Eligibles,"Critters Who Need Good Homes Maggie, a six-year old Australian Shepherd mix, has an unbelievable tongue that's eager to lick gravy off anything; maybe even you! Loves kids. Max, a three-year-old tabby, was given up recently by his owner. Perfect for medical experiments requiring animals with iron constitutions and high pain thresholds. CHICAGO' Urging everyone to lighten up and ' save the pearl-clutching'  for real problems, local catcaller Will Snyder confirmed Friday that he was not sure what the big deal was because he' d love it if a woman referred to him as a fat, stuck-up bitch. ' No one ever calls me a dumb filthy whore when I' m headed home after a long day of work, but you know what, it sure would be a nice thing to hear every now and then,'  said Snyder, 27, adding that it would be a tragedy if the political correctness of the #MeToo era had reached a point where it might prevent a woman from walking close behind him for several blocks and then telling him he was an ugly, uptight cunt who needed to be fucked hard. ' Honestly, what' s the problem? I' d be flattered if some girl blocked my path on the sidewalk, grabbed her crotch, and told me my big slutty lips would look great on her pussy. That' s a compliment in my book, so don' t act all offended when you hear that kind of thing from me.'  The catcaller then reportedly sighed and reiterated his long-held position that there wasn' t much he could do about it, because they were ' all a bunch of frigid dykes.'

7,A Message from the Publisher: Only Hoover Can Get America Back to Work!,"As I recall, it was the night of August 8, 1932. Hoover was in office, and my family was fighting to rally support for his re-election bid of that year. Let him finish the job! Only Hoover can get America back to work! Nurse! You infernal she-beast! Apply my ointment! I swear to you, dear reader, that half-bovine nurse of mine is stone deaf. I' ve been ringing her bell solidly for the past three days, and she has yet to respond to me with more than a grumpy look and a perfunctory and slipshod performance of her bedpan emptying duties. The newspaper press foreman was wiping down the metal blocks of type from the previous day' s issue of The Onion. The cover story was a hearty skewering of Roosevelt' s latest cock-and-bull welfare program, as I recall. Throw the Harvard bum out! He' ll never get re-elected! Down with the Menken' Horace Act! And it was on this stormy night, some 56 years ago now, that an event which shaped our history was brewing. I have called and called. That god-damned infernal nurse is not coming. I' m bleeding out of my wrinkled old anus! My shriveled pancreas is secreting yellowish fluid through my esophagus! Hear me, witch! You wretched old withered husk of a woman! I am a feeble, dying man. Yet with all my strength I cry out for the nurse. Every three seconds I bellow at the top of my shrunken, black lungs, encrusted as they are with printers'  ink and cigar resin: ' Infernal nurse! Come to my aid!'  It was a night of legend, a night of which history is made. Magic was truly in the air. I was remembering something just now. What was it? Ah, dammit. Death to the heathen Chinese! Remember the Maine! 44-40 or fight! Loose lips sink ships! A chicken in every pot! Vote for Huey Long! Every man a king! T. Herman Zweibel, the great grandson of Onion founder Friedrich Siegfried Zweibel, was born in 1868, became editor of The Onion at age 20, and persisted in various editorial posts until his launching into space in 2001. Zweibel's name became synonymous with American business success in the 20th century. Many consider him the ' Father Of American Journalism,'  also the title of his well-known 1943 biography, written by Norman Rombauer.","opinion, archive, commentary, vol 29 issue 24, t. herman zweibel, the onion"
8,"Either Hubby Rick's Wacky Acrylic Baseball Cap Collection Goes, Or I Go!","Well, I finally finished the spring housecleaning. Now I understand why people give their houses a good cleaning only once a year' what a chore! We didn' t have dust bunnies, we had dust bears! And my vacuum cleaner was working so much overtime it almost went on strike! But the worst chore of all had to be cleaning out the closets. The clutter had to be seen to be believed! Call me a sentimental sap, but I just can' t bring myself to toss out my old Holly Hobbie silkscreen pillow. And I will admit to you right now I still have the Kotex Junior Miss Sanitary Napkin Belt the school nurse gave us gals in seventh grade gym class! But hubby Rick is even worse! This became apparent when I yanked out one of the drawers from our waterbed and pulled out a stack of the grimiest-looking baseball caps you' ve ever seen! And they' re not just dirty literally' the caps have raunchy sayings on them too. Now I' m not knocking hats with sayings on them' some of them are really clever. Just the other day I couldn' t resist buying one from the Hallmark store that said, ' Physically Fitû€f To Eat Chocolate!'  But Rick' s are the most offensive and tasteless things I had ever seen! One had a picture of a drunk at a bar saying, ' If You Saw My Wife, You' d Drink Too!'  Another said, ' I Have a PMS Wife' A Pretty Mean Sow!'  And I nearly flipped my wig when I saw, ' No Fat Chicks!'  I never felt so humiliated in all my life! This was worse than the time Rick read my diary! It was like Rick was making fun of me in the crudest way possible in front of his friends and co-workers at the tire center, and I had no way to fight back! Well, I may be amply proportioned, but you can be certain Rick is no Cary Grant, and I' ve never worn anything that made fun of him! (Okay, I admit to owning an ' Old Fart' s Wife'  sweatshirt, but I haven' t worn it in the longest time.) So it goes without saying I gave Rick a great big piece of my mind that evening! At first, he tried to ignore me by watching his sports bloopers tape, but he sure sat up and took notice when I threatened to leave him if he didn' t trash those caps! But instead of seeing the error of his ways, he started whining about how he was always getting ridiculed in my column and how his buddies were now referring to him as ' Hubby Rick","opinion, archive, commentary, vol 29 issue 24, jean teasdale, the onion"
9,U.S. Schools Unveil New Tony Danza-Based Curriculum,"Focus to Shift from Reading and Math to Likable Veteran Sitcom Star WASHINGTON, D.C.' Ushering in a new era in American education, U.S. Secretary of Education William Norwell announced Monday that all U.S. public schools will soon switch to a rigorous, Tony Danza-based curriculum. ' As things stand now, our kids simply aren' t learning enough about Tony Danza,'  said Norwell, explaining the switch. ' Unde r the new plan, by the time every American youngster graduates from high school, they will have a rock-solid foundation in all the basics of Tony Danza.'  Under the new plan, by second grade, all students will have a basic working knowledge of Who' s The Boss. By sixth grade, all U.S. students will gain full exposure to the first four seasons of Taxi, in addition to a basic familiarity with the 27 post-Andy Kaufman episodes. By senior year of high school, all students will have gained a broad, sophisticated understanding of every aspect of Danza' s career, including his work in the 1981 film Going Ape!, early television commercials and recent starring role on ABC' s Hudson Street. ' I am confident that America' s children will receive the finest Tony Danza education anywhere on earth,'  Norwell said. ' And as a result, they will graduate better prepared to face the Tony Danza-related demands of the working world than the youth of any other nation.'  According to a 1990 survey, America' s schools ranked 41st out of 45 industrialized nations in quality of Tony Danza education. Norwell first came up with the plan after visiting a Spartanburg, SC, high school in 1994. ' I talked to some of the students and was appalled by what I heard,'  Norwell said. ' There were kids who didn' t know the last name of Tony' s Who' s the Boss character. Kids who had never seen Taxi. There was even one young man who had never even heard of She' s Out of Control, the 1989 comedy in which Tony plays the overprotective father of a boy-crazy teenage girl. That' s just wrong.'

' Each day the flames rise from the First Baptist Church, our Olympic pride grows stronger.'

16,Bill Gates To Get Half,"REDMOND, WA' In a move designed to hasten the inevitable, billionaire Microsoft tycoon Bill Gates announced yesterday that from now on, he will be getting half. Gates, whose savvy and aggressiveness propelled his Microsoft corporation to the top of the business world and made him America' s richest man with an estimated fortune of $18 billion, announced his plan at a press conference yesterday from his Seattle-area compound. ' I get half,'  he explained. It has not yet been decided if Gates'  half will be taken straight down the middle or by liquidating all assets and dividing up raw capital. The question will be settled later this week by a special session of Gates'  half of the U.S. Congress. ' Don' t touch anything until you' re sure it' s not part of my half,'  Gates instructed the world' s citizenry yesterday via the several million 40-foot-high projection screens he has scattered throughout the globe. ' I don' t want anyone messing up stuff in my half.'  Until everything can be clearly divided between Gates and persons who are not Gates, measures will be taken to ensure the integrity of Gates'  half. Citizens are instructed to remain in their homes, consuming a carefully monitored minimum of their perishables and subjecting their personal possessions to as little wear and tear as possible. In the event something belonging to Gates is consumed or damaged, Gates announced he will take punitive action, levying fines of up to $14 billion, and may even insist that offenders themselves be included in his half. ' Don' t take from my half,'  the 36-year-old Gates said. ' Ice cream and cool cars are part of my half.'  Gates also expressed interest in possessing Apple, IBM and the former Soviet Union. ' You know, I own the Bettman Archive,'  Gates said. ' You can' t look at it unless I say so.'  Gates'  half will be collected via an advanced subroutine built directly into Windows 95. Computer users without Windows 95 will have it automatically sent to them, with the cost of the program deducted from their half. Those without computers will be directed to special Gates-owned DNA-resequencing centers where a special bio-silicate form of Windows 95 will be injected directly into their bloodstreams. Once in the bloodstream, the Windows program is designed to breed virally at the base of its host brainstem and to begin work on calculating Gates'  half. ' Everyone must contribute to my half,'  Gates said. ' Any number, no matter how small, can be divided into two halves, one of which will be mine.'  Gates would not comment on the possibility of eventually increasing his share from a mere half to a controlling interest. Sources close to Gates would neither confirm nor deny rumors that Gates might offer up to 15 percent of his half in exchange for the other half of the world. ' The transitional period may be difficult,'  Gates said. ' But it will be quick. I hope that this time will be remembered pleasantly in the half of people' s minds that remain their own.'

17,Bumbling Astronauts Caught in Wacky 'Lunch-Launch' Mix-up,"HOUSTON' The international aerospace community was shocked Monday when the experimental new Phoebus 3 Space Shuttle rocketed into space prematurely, manned only with two bumbling NASA janitorial workers as pilot and crew. As of press time, it is believed that an error in the prelaunch foodstuffs loading procedure is to blame. The mishap is believed to have sprung from the word ' lunch'  being mistaken for the liftoff command ' launch.'  ' According to onboard video footage of the incident, it appears that what we scientists call a ' zany mix-up'  may have occurred,'  said Dr. Heilegge Danzino, chairperson of NASA' s special investigative committee. According to Danzino, the footage shows the two janitors' known only as Barney and Junior' loading and checking the ship' s mealtime nutrient packets. Upon loading the first nutrient parcel, Barney called out to Junior, ' Breakfast,'  and received in turn the reply, ' Check.'  After the second parcel was loaded, Barney said ' Lunch,'  at which point the ship' s rocket boosters ignited. In the ensuing chaos of liftoff, it is difficult to determine exactly what is taking place. However, Barney can clearly be heard booming out to Junior, ' I said lunch, not launch!,'  leading NASA researchers to the ' zany mix-up'  conclusion. Other officials assert the mishap may have been the result of what aeronautics experts term ' wacky antics.'  A battery of emergency competency examinations is currently being taken by all NASA janitorial and maintenance staff members to prevent further errors of this type. Officials stress that the bungling duo is not in danger at present. ' Normally, we' d just radio up re-entry instructions to the capsule and have the whole thing back on the ground in a few hours,'  said Corbin Bursar, a NASA flight control worker. ' But due to the particularly bumbling nature of these two, we' ve only been able to open a one-way radio channel with them, as they haven' t been able to figure out how to turn their helmet radios on.'  ' Unable to communicate with them directly,'  continued Bursar, ' we are nonetheless observing them closely. But so far, they' ve primarily been hitting each other with rolled-up hats.'  Despite the wacky twosome' s lack of trouble so far, many officials still predict disaster. ' The excessively bumbling status of the two workers means I cannot rule out the possibility of unabated, non-stop hijinks,'  NASA Director of Communications Halversom Franks said. ' There is a very real threat that they may get more and more lost, spinning wildly through the airless recesses of the cosmos, having nutty, goofy misadventures along the way.'  NASA did not rule out that these wacky adventures would include visitations to dozens of distant planets made up of foam and plasterboard landscapes reminiscent of the sets of live-action Saturday morning television programs of the late 1970s. Added Franks: ' If they meet and befriend some sort of puppetlike alien sidekick who speaks only in honking sounds, they' re done for.'  Though the two janitors'  pictures have yet to be released to the public, one of them is said to look strikingly similar to actor Bob Denver. The other bears a striking resemblance to actor Chuck McCann, known for his comedic roles in television and the big screen, such as the hit films Cannonball Run and Cannonball Run II. ' It seems obvious now that these two were unfit for capsule flight prep duty,'  said NASA spokesperson Bill Reid. ' They are inarguably nutty, and also, if I may say so, they are far-out. Given their current location in outer space, I do not believe it would be unfair to describe them as Far-Out Space Nuts.'  Flowers and memorial donations may be sent to NASA in the name of the janitors'  families.","science & technology, archive, space, news, vol 29 issue 24, the onion"
18,Young Olympic Hopeful Realizes Dream of Killing Father,"ATLANTA' U.S. Olympic gymnast Dominique Miller, 15, considered a favorite to bring home the gold in Atlanta, achieved her lifelong dream yesterday, killing her father/coach with a 12-gauge shotgun. ' I can' t believe I' ve actually done it,'  said an exuberant, beaming Miller, holding several giant bouquets of flowers given to her by fans. ' This is really a lifelong dream come true' it' s the greatest high a young athlete could ever experience.'  Miller, who had been training with her father, Karl Miller, for the Olympics since age three, realized the longtime dream shortly after finishing second in yesterday' s Olympic qualifying round, shooting him in the chest before hundreds of onlookers. Miller said she had a good feeling about the shot as soon as it left the shotgun. ' I had his heart squarely lined up in the gun sight, and I got a real clean pull on the trigger,'  she said. ' The moment that blast went off and the gun kicked back, I knew I' d landed it perfect.'  One gymnastics judge who happened to witness the event also gave Miller high marks. ' Dominique' s form was perfect' the bullet entered the body cleanly and stuck squarely in the middle of the chest cavity, right between the heart and the sternum,'  said judge Marcy Conners of Canada. ' That' s right where you want it.'  Added Conners: ' I would give this murder a 10.'  For Miller, the slaying represented the culmination of years of hard work. ' I' ve been practicing this routine for years,'  Miller said. ' Every morning at 6, I' d get up early and do an exact run-through, hiding the gun under my bed, sneaking it over to the arena under my coat, and pulling it out from under the table in the trainer' s room.'  Miller almost realized her dream at the ' 92 Barcelona Olympics, but a last-minute trigger-finger injury dashed her hopes. ' I sprained it pretty bad the morning I was going to do it,'  Miller said. ' It was devastating' I thought I' d never be able to come back; I thought I' d be too old to try again in ' 96. But I did it.'  Miller was arrested soon after yesterday' s slaying, charged with second-degree homicide. If found guilty, she could face 30 years in federal prison. ' I' m so excited, I' m not even thinking about prison right now,'  said a detained but triumphant Miller, raising her handcuffed hands and waving to fans. ' Right now I just want to enjoy this moment, enjoy what I' ve achieved. Maybe tomorrow I' ll think about the homicide charges, but right now, this is a time for celebration.'  When asked by one reporter what she will do next, now that she has killed her father, the gymnast replied: ' I' m going to the Andrew B. Stevens Federal Courthouse Building!'  In addition to receiving letters from thousands of fans, Miller has received congratulatory messages from such celebrities as Brooke Shields, Macaulay Culkin and tennis stars Jennifer Capriati and Mary Pierce. ' Congratulations, Dominique!'  read a note from Capriati. ' I' m so proud of you for what you' ve accomplished. It' s something I' ve always dreamed of doing but never got the courage to do.

19,U.S. Drug Czar Announces: 'I'm Higher Than Hell Right Now',"WASHINGTON, D.C.' U.S. Drug Czar Richard B. McTaggart, the nation' s Commander in Chief in the War on Drugs, held a press conference yesterday to announce he is ' higher than hell'  after smoking marijuana with some friends. McTaggart, who appeared calm as he addressed reporters and the American public at large, promised he will continue the fulfillment of his duties as U.S. Drug Czar. He stressed the U.S. must wage war on illegal narcotics everywhere and vowed to start directly attacking the problem ' maybe later today, when I' m not so fucking baked.'  McTaggart, appointed by President Clinton in 1992 to replace former Drug Czar William Bennett, has been a tireless advocate for the ' three strikes and you' re out'  policy for drug users. He also spearheaded the recent campaign to suspend Fourth Amendment rights for drug dealers, allowing police officers to seize their property without a warrant. Commented McTaggart: ' The colors, man. Look at the colors.'  According to leading DEA officials, in 1996, more Americans than ever are using drugs, and arrests resulting from drug-related offenses have more than tripled since just 15 years ago. When asked how he plans to attack such an enormous, daunting problem, McTaggart said, ' Please, stop. You' re making my head hurt. I can' t even think about all that crap right now.'  In his quest to stem the tide of drugs, McTaggart is demanding at least $40 million in increased federal aid for drug prevention and awareness programs, tougher jail sentences for repeat offenders, and a large bag of tortilla chips. ' I' ve got a serious case of the munchies,'  McTaggart said. ' Just as soon as I get some food in me I am confident we can take some major strides toward decreasing the use of illegal substances in the U.S.'  President Clinton came to the Drug Czar' s defense in a statement to the press issued by the White House. ' Mr. McTaggart has been a bold and effective leader in America' s ongoing war on drugs, but right now he' s clearly a little high,'  Clinton said. ' I am fully confident that if we leave him alone for a while, and maybe let him take a long nap, he will come back fully restored to once again combat the scourge of narcotics ravaging our nation.'  Clinton also urged all Americans to ' be mellow'  in the presence of the Drug Czar. McTaggart thanked Clinton for his words of support, but countered that he was not merely a little high, but in fact ' fried out of my gourd.'  Sources close to McTaggart say he may be even higher now than last weekend, when he smoked some pot before seeing a movie with a friend. ' The Postmaster General and I pulled four or five bongers apiece before seeing Independence Day,'  McTaggart recalled. ' I don' t even remember how we got to the theater. We were high' but not half as high as I am at this moment.'  Despite his current condition, McTaggart urged all young Americans not to not follow his example, and to stay off drugs. ' I pray that America' s children stay away from this narcotic,'  McTaggart said. ' But if you aren' t going to listen to my warning, or are coerced by drug dealers, I urge you to find some of the good stuff, like Northern Lights or Humboldt homegrown. It' s more expensive, but the results are incredible.' ","politics, archive, drugs, news, vol 29 issue 24, politics"
20,"Company To Use Internet To Waste Money, Employees'  Time","SAN FRANCISCO' An area medical supply firm unveiled plans yesterday to waste both money and employees'  time via the internet.

The company has already seen results: ' Employees waste up to 50 percent more time than before,'  accountant Steve Piersall said. ' All the more exciting is that this is costing us, in terms of modem purchases and web-server time, upwards of $80,000 per week.'  Syrus may also go ' on-line'  with a ' website.'  WASHINGTON' With its vote to adopt a resolution denouncing the freshman' s congresswoman behavior, the House of Representatives formally censured Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Friday for employing the sexist slur ' fucking bitch'  in a speech on the House floor the day prior. ' The representative from New York' s 14th District is hereby condemned for her unapologetic enunciation of these hateful, abusive words, which not only brought disgrace to this esteemed body but were incredibly demeaning to all womankind,'  House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said as he read aloud the official rebuke, adding that as a woman herself, Ocasio-Cortez should have known better than to speak aloud the unconscionable term, let alone read it into the Congressional Record. ' Her appalling speech of July 23 does not reflect the values of the United States Congress, nor does it reflect the example we wish to set for our children' especially our daughters. While this body will not ask what prompted her to adopt such unprofessional language, it will require the representative to issue an immediate apology to her colleagues or face further disciplinary action for her misconduct.'  In his own words, McCarthy went on to observe that it was too soon to tell just how far back Ocasio-Cortez had set ' young ladies'  in Congress with her ' hysterical'  outburst.","science & technology, archive, news in brief, vol 29 issue 24, the onion"

' Many blacks enjoy ' rapping'  music,'  said Briggs & Adams Advertising president Sherman Roe, who developed the campaign for HospCare HMO. ' And what better way to tap into their market than by ' rapping'  good health to them?'  Roe' s campaign employs the use of a black teenager doing a ' rap'  for good health. Billboards of the campaign have been put up in black neighborhoods, and radio and TV ads have aired on black-oriented stations in the area. Roe predicts area blacks will, as a result, be ' ' rapping'  happy with their HMO service.' ","health, archive, healthcare, news in brief, vol 29 issue 23, the onion"

28,New Secretary to Personalize Workspace,"MINNEAPOLIS' U.S. Bureau of Departmental Operations secretary Helen Lastrom, 38, is slated to personalize her workplace, a six-foot square cubicle delineated by three grayish-brown office dividers, in the Bureau' s Minneapolis office this week. Her plans include the adornment of the divider, desk and computer monitor' s outer edges with items intended to ' brighten'  the workplace and remind her of friends, good times and family, or just to make her laugh. ' I enjoy humor,'  Lastrom said. Lastrom was hired by the Bureau last week after passing civil service test 12E, which increased her rating class and qualified her for one-level caste promotion. Her previous position was with the City Office of Management and Operations Systems. In many ways, her new job will be similar, but Lastrom intends to adorn her workspace differently. ' I' m really excited about this new job, because I think I' m going to put my crazy little Mexican puppet with the bobbing head to the left of my phone.'  According to Lastrom, at her previous job, the Mexican puppet had been situated at the right of her phone. ' I got this when my girlfriend Pam and I went to Mexico after graduating from correspondence school,'  she said. ' We had so much fun in Mexico. I hope I get to go again some day.'  Lastrom is also slated to hang several humorous posters on her wall, including one depicting her favorite cartoon character, Cathy, tearing her hair out and yelling, ' I hate Mondays!'  ' I can relate to that poster so much,'  Lastrom said. ' I look at that poster and it' s like, ' I swear that' s me.' '  If Lastrom passes her three-month probationary period and is secured for a six-month employment contract at full pay and limited benefits, she indends to personalize her workspace even more. ' Right now money is really tight. But I' d love to buy a little plant, even though I' m nowhere near a window. I just love plants.'  Lastrom also plans to put some word-balloon stickers on some photos she took at her friend Mary' s wedding and tape them to her desktop. ' Those photos are so funny,'  she said. ' Mary can be such a riot.'  Lastrom is expected to put a Far Side appointment calendar on her desk within the week. ' The Far Side is completely off the wall, just like me,'  Lastrom said. ' All my friends say I' m crazy and really different, just like that cartoon.'  The television show Saturday Night Live will also provide humor for Lastrom' s divider wall' a greeting card featuring ' Deep Thoughts, by Jack Handey'  is reportedly in the works. Lastrom also plans to pin up photos of her 3-year-old son, Peter, as well as drawings he made. ' He is just the most important thing in my life,'  Lastrom said. ' I wish I could spend more time with him.'  Lastrom said she believes anyone who comes into her workspace is destined to be entertained by the decor, which she said perfectly reflects her unique personality. Said Lastrom: ' Whether it' s somebody from shipping coming to get a purchase order approved or a packing slip verified, or whether it' s my boss coming in here to put me through a performance review, they should enjoy their visit.'

31,Today's Kids Have No Valor,"I am Higelac of the Healfdanes, and I have spoken: The youth of today have no valor! No courage of kings! T-shirts? Blue jeans? When I was a young man we wore bone helmets and horns that proclaimed our kinship with valorous deeds of courage. We wore hairshirts that ripped our flesh even as we drank our mead. And we fought for great treasures known across this middle earth! My son, Unferth-the-Spirited, once sacked an entire mead-hall for a bloody boar' s head hanging from the door. This was his treasure: He wore it and became known as Unferth-the-Boar' s-Head. Where is such valor today? Last week I spied a young man exchanging money for a Snickers bar. Money? Exchange? Where is the honor in such an act? And further, he did not even stab the cashier when he left. I am Higelac, son of Hrothgar, who wore Banloc, the sword of the Scyldings, as a token of his valor. I sacked for gold and jewels. I have lost patience with today' s youth, with their ' music'  and their ' automobiles.'  I demand viking ships, spears, swords and torture devices! Last week I saw a young maiden taking part in a most shameful exchange. She was providing fellow citizens coffee in return for paper currency. What has this nation-state come to? Hwaet! Lo! I want swords! Fire! I want sacking and burning! Where is the courage in negotiation? Without deeds of valor and courage, how do we remember the name of Wealtheow the Peaceweaver? We do not, I tell you! When I was a young viking, we sacked for the sake of sacking! We burned for the sake of burning! I sacked and stabbed for the treasures of the Geatmaecgas! I slaughtered friend and foe, monster and demon. I, chief Healfdane warrior, once slew an entire village. Banloc the Brilliant once took 500 in that time. Where is that valor today? Lost! Lost! Just yesterday I saw several lads playing ' basketball'  in the park. Worthless rabble! Gone are the days when we thought everyone to be the enemy, and we committed great crimes against humanity. These youths must be armed with byrnes and shields, with swords and helmets hewn from the bones of great beasts slaughtered in battle. They must raid and sack and pillage! I, Higelac, took Banloc and smote Ecgtheow, leader of the Danes, at the battle of Finnsburgh. On that day a great many heads were lost. But no one smites anymore! This morning I saw a group of children running around playing tag. And who was killed? No one! There was no carnage, no headless beasts, nothing! And for what? Again, I say, nothing! No head of the wicked Grendel, no houses of kings, no spoils at all. You call this valor? We need sacking and burning! The whole of this middle earth will be destroyed without the might of its people. We will perish in the depths of the dark abyss, leaving no name behind. The need for valor is urgent, the time of reckoning imminent. Nation' s youth, hear me and hear me well: I know all of this, for I am Higelac, prince of that fame known across this land, and I have spoken!

32,Tyrannical African Despot Installs Suggestion Box,"Sudanese President-for-Life Welcomes Questions, Comments KHARTOUM, SUDAN' In a move Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali is hailing as ' a major step forward'  for democracy in Africa, the United Nations announced Monday that Sudan' s repressive President, General Kolimba Djimasta, has agreed to install a suggestion box outside the gates of his 10,000-acre mansion. ' We care about the quality of your stay here in Sudan,'  Djimasta said. ' That' s why I want you to rate your satisfaction with my kingdom: Was your torturer friendly? Was your village burned to the ground in a friendly and convenient manner? Would you like to see more or less testicular torture? Would you like to be killed at this time?'  Under the Khartoum Accord, the suggestion box will be placed on one of the two imported marble gates in front of Djimasta' s mansion. For those who don' t have a pencil handy, one will be provided. As an added incentive to get people to fill out comment cards, the first 50 people to do so will not be brutally murdered. ' We' ve really gotten some very good, very valuable feedback,'  Djimasta said. ' The only downside is the occasional comment card that' s soaked with blood. Those can be difficult to read.'  Among the comments Djimasta has already received: ' Please do not send your elite military police to kill me' ; ' Please do not dispatch your secret military squad to murder me and my family' ; and ' Your Grand Excellence, I beg of you, I am innocent' please do not kill me.'  The comment cards also contain a space to write your name and address, so Djimasta can personally ' reply'  to those who are dissatisfied. Djimasta, who took the reins of power in a violent coup d' Ã©tat in 1984, was the subject of international outrage this April, when the Red Cross unearthed the bodies of more than 5,000 opposition-party members in a desert grave. Protest by the international community led to the dispatching of a U.N. team to Khartoum last month, which led to the installation of the new suggestion box. ' One thorny point in our negotiations was the issue of how many blank lines to leave on the index cards,'  U.N. chief negotiator Uwe Eckhaus said. ' We felt at least 10 would be needed to provide enough room for detailed suggestions, but the General felt that anything more than five would necessitate unnaturally cramped handwriting.'  The Khartoum agreement caps off a month of diplomatic triumph for the oft-maligned U.N. Three weeks ago, the continued slaughter of Kurds by Iraq' s Saddam Hussein was condemned by the Security Council, in a resolution that expressed ' the most fervent possible tsk-tsking.'  And just last week, Boutros Boutros-Ghali was the commencement speaker at a high school graduation in Dix Hills, New York. ' We live in an age of international violence and terror,'  said Boturos-Ghali in the speech, which preceded the Khartoum Accord by days. ' We cannot continue to permit other countries to deny basic liberties to their people and thereby tread upon the fundamental decency that is the natural birthright of every human being. . .

36,Loveless Union Ends In Baby,"ROCKFORD, IL' A loveless union resulted Monday in the birth of a baby who, according to area love experts, will almost certainly never receive the warm, nurturing love it needs to develop fully. Nor, they say, will it ever learn to show love for others in its lifetime. The child, William Thurnbloch, Jr., was conceived in the hopes that its presence might function as a love substitute in the lives of its parents, William and Suzanne Thurnbloch, of Rockford. Sources agree this attempt is doomed to failure, and that the Thurnblochs will continue to live lives as devoid of love as ever before. ' I doubt either Bill or Suzanne ever fully comprehended what love was, and, therefore, never realized that their lives lacked love,'  Department of Love and Related Issues regional chairperson and psychotherapist Kent McNuhm said. ' Nonetheless, a subconscious perception of the inherent emptiness of their lives drove them to reproduce.'  McNuhm went on to cite the couple' s total lack of interest in each other' s daily lives, refusal to engage in conversation, and constant, ill-fated extra-marital dalliances as factors marking the union as loveless. Married four years ago as a response to family pressure, as well as to stave off a deep-seated fear of solitude, the Thurnblochs lack even the most basic psychological characteristics required to raise an emotionally healthy child. It is virtually certain their baby will grow up to mirror their staggeringly bleak worldview, raised in silent agony in a world it rightly perceives as cold and uncaring. Though acquaintances of the Thurnblochs report Suzanne has never been happier than she is while cuddling her new baby, experts firmly believe this feeling is meaningless and transient, signifying no real change or growth. ' The baby is at this point unable to distinguish between itself and the rest of the world, including its mother,'  McNuhm said. ' Suzanne is only capable of relating to the baby because it has no real personality of its own, serving as a narcissistic projection of herself.'  ' Once the baby develops ego boundaries and becomes a distinct individual, she will complain constantly about it, tormenting it unceasingly with verbal and non-verbal cruelty, eventually withdrawing into apathy and neglect, and focusing her affections on some other identity-less entity, like a puppy or a character on TV,'  he added. Though the Thurnblochs engaged in successful sexual penetration for several months prior to conception, since the initial impregnation they have reverted to their usual states of sexual behavior: furtive masturbation, coupled with misogynistic fantasies in William Sr.' s case, and frigidity in Suzanne' s. Experts say not only will William Jr. be unloved throughout childhood, he will also be unable to perceive love if and when it is ever offered him. ' Little William,'  McNuhm concluded, ' will be incapable of relating to the outside world, unable to differentiate between, say, petting a neighbor' s dog and poking at its eyes with a spork.'  The couple plans to send him to military school once he learns to speak.","local, parents, archive, babies, news, vol 29 issue 23, local"
37,Catholic Church Allows Gays to Serve as Altar Boys,"VATICAN CITY' In a radical break from centuries of strict church doctrine, the Pope approved a measure yesterday that would allow gay men and boys to be provisionally accepted into the Catholic Church. According to the pontiff' s new plan, gays will be allowed to serve as altar boys at all public and private church functions. ' It is high time the Catholic Church moved forward on the issue of homosexuality,'  said Cardinal John Valento, speaking on behalf of the Pope. ' And what better way to introduce young gay men into the Church than through the gracious and caring hands of an experienced priest?'  Valento added he looks forward to showing the new altar boys the glory of the Lord' s and his own brand of ' everlasting love.'  The new altar boys'  duties will be similar to those of the current ones, with responsibilities including lighting and snuffing candles, assisting clergy with the sacrament of Holy Communion, burning incense and assisting clergy with bathing and dressing. Reactions from within the clergy were largely positive. ' I am pleased that our Church' s anti-gay stance is finally going by the wayside,'  said Father Tom Coughlin of St. Peter' s Church in Chicago. ' And to help welcome these new altar boys, I have decided to hold a small pool party at my house on July 25. All are welcome.'  Added Coughlin, ' Bring your trunks.'  Still, not everyone within the church was as welcoming. ' Though I am God' s servant and will do as the Pope directs, I am strongly opposed to this unholy contamination of the Church,'  remarked Father Anthony Worrell of Denver, CO. ' I will therefore be inspecting every single inch of these new altar boys in order to ensure the absolute and utter perfection and cleanliness of their bodies.'  Father Daniel McComb added he will follow the Pope' s orders reluctantly. ' Unearthly beauty or no unearthly beauty, these men are filthy sinners,'  McComb said. ' Be assured whatever gays I take on will be thoroughly spanked each and every day. The pretty ones twice, the vile tempters.'  McComb added he would also ' use his fists'  if he were ' called upon to do so by the Lord Christ.'  When asked if the new plan could someday lead to gays in the priesthood, New York' s Cardinal John O' Connor replied: ' Why, no.'  ' We wish only to give them meaningful work here on Earth,'  O' Connor said, ' since they will spend the afterlife suffering eternal hellfire.'

38,Independent Investigation: Special Olympics Fixed,"Many ' Winners'  Found to Have Lost Badly Scandal rocked the sports world yesterday when a secret investigation revealed that the Special Olympics, one of the nation' s premier annual athletic competitions, is fixed. According to the undercover probe, over the years hundreds and possibly thousands of participating athletes have been declared ' winners,'  despite losing their respective contests, often by wide margins. ' I don' t think there' s anything ' winning'  or ' special'  about finishing in eighth or ninth place,'  chief investigator Harlan Brundage said. ' Do these kids think they' re winners just because they tried? Just because they gave it their all? Well, let me tell you, trying doesn' t make you a winner. Coming in first does.'  An estimated 15,000 athletes participated in the Special Olympics this year, and, according to Special Olympics awards records, every one of them was declared a ' winner.'  According to Brundage, until a thorough investigation can be conducted, all Special Olympians will be stripped of their medals and held for questioning. Several Special Olympics officials and judges are also being detained. Evidence of the massive scandal was first discovered June 17, during a Special Olympics competition in Milpitas, CA. Marcy Simms, a 27-year-old Milpitas resident, was declared a winner in the gymnastics competition, despite falling off the two-foot-wide balance beam some 11 times and failing to execute even a single cartwheel. Upon finishing her lackluster routine, Simms raised her arms above her head and cheered in triumph. Her parents then raced over to hug and kiss her, joyously sharing in their daughter' s ' victory.'  ' When we saw Marcy celebrating, we were immediately suspicious of corruption,'  Brundage said. ' Her routine was terrible' what could she possibly have been so happy about?'  Gymnastics judge Olga Rublovskya, a bronze medalist at the 1976 Montreal Olympics, agreed. ' I would give this performance of Marcy' s a 0.0,'  Rublovskya said. ' The routine was not very good at all.'  Further evidence of scandal was uncovered at this year' s Harwich, MA, Special Olympics, where Jeff Coombs, 32, was awarded a medal in the 40-yard dash competition despite coming in dead last out of 15 competitors. Following the race, an investigator asked Coombs if he realized how poorly he fared, to which Coombs replied, ' I' m special! I' m a winner!'  When the investigator countered that Coombs was neither special nor a winner, but rather an exceptional failure who finished in dead last place, Coombs vehemently maintained his specialness. ' These are substandard athletes at best,'  Brundage said. ' Why they are competing in something called the Olympics is a question we must answer. This shocking scandal must be uncovered. I promise a full investigation.'  The scandal has also resulted in a loss of sponsorship dollars. Already, Reebok and Toshiba, the Special Olympics'  two largest sponsors, have announced they are pulling out, and Pepsi is expected to follow. ' It is in Reebok' s best interest at this time to put our money behind the 1996 Atlanta Games, where the athletes have proven their ability to run, jump and catch,'  said Marvin Balsam, Reebok Director of Marketing, explaining his company' s decision to shift $158 million from the Special Olympics to the Atlanta Games. ' Until we see more physical skill from these Special Olympians, we have no choice but to spend our sponsorship dollars elsewhere.' ","archive, olympics, news, vol 29 issue 23, the onion"

40,Compton-Area Mother Warns Community: 'I Said No Hitting!',"COMPTON, CA' Gloria Harper, a Compton-area mother who has openly condemned inner-city violence in the past, spoke out yesterday against the recent outbreak of hitting in her community. According to Harper, a single working mother of three, other residents are also fed up with the increasing incidence of hitting, not to mention occasional shoving and scratching. ' The violence here has gotten out of control,'  Harper said. ' Everywhere you look, young people are hitting each other. Many times late at night, when I' m lying in bed, I can hear the sound of closed-fist punches coming from right outside my window.'  According to neighborhood parents, hitting has always been a problem, but it was typically gang or drug-related. Now, Harper says, kids don' t even need a reason to hit. What' s worse, she insists, certain types of ' rap'  music popular with area youth often glorify hitting, along with some forms of light kicking. Harper points to an incident last week when a local boy was struck on the upper arm by an open-handed slap. What makes this case so alarming, according to Harper, is that the blow was delivered by one of the boy' s school classmates. ' When I saw that happen,'  she said, ' I ran down the front steps screaming. But it was too late to stop it. By the time I got there, he was already lying on the ground, holding his arm and saying, ' Ow.' '  According to one neighbor who witnessed the incident, the young boy had been hit ' two, maybe three times.'  Gang members, whom Harper and others blame for the recent escalation of hitting, say that the violent realities of their community offer no alternatives to hitting. Members of several area gangs did not return phone calls when contacted by this paper. ' We need to reclaim our community,'  Harper said. ' We' re seeing younger and younger kids shoving and kicking. Some of them are just babies.'  Other area residents echo Harper' s sentiments, adding that they don' t feel safe anymore. However, past attempts to curb the hitting epidemic have met with indifference and even resistance from law enforcement officials, who say they have more pressing concerns. Police Chief Ron Davenport cites a recent outbreak of biting in East L.A., which left one young man with teeth marks on his leg and discolored skin around the area of the bite. One mother even reported that her 17-year-old boy had his skin broken, and that blood appeared and almost rose to the surface. To minimize the risks of being hit, Davenport recommends people wear sweatshirts, or, ideally, cushy, down-filled jackets. ' This will prevent a hit from really hurting,'  Davenport said. ' It can also help minimize the risk of getting a bruise.'  Sociologists from the University of Southern California say the dramatic rise in hitting incidents could be a cyclical phenomenon without a clear causal relationship. ' As far as we know,'  said Eugene Phelps, a professor of Urban Sociology at USC, ' hitting' when accompanied by reckless pushing and aggravated poking' may be cyclical and would best be remedied by ignoring the undesirable behavior and rewarding the behavior that fosters constructive, cooperative solutions to problems.'  Compton' s problems have not gone unnoticed in Washington, D.C. The recent shoving of a 7-year-old girl prompted outrage on Capitol Hill. ' Children in Los Angeles live in a prison of violence and fear,'  Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) said. ' At some point, we' ve got to get a hold of these gang members and tell them to cut it out.'

41,Bob Dole Stuck on Sandbar,"CAIRO, IL' Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole remains stranded on a sandbar on the Mississippi River near the Illinois-Missouri border today after multiple rescue attempts over the past several days proved unsuccessful. The former Kansas senator ran aground in a mire of thick sand in a shallow bend of the river Friday, soon after departing a potluck fundraiser in nearby Independence, MO. Campaign workers blame the accident on a faulty blade in Dole' s twin-engine outboard motor, which has reportedly experienced similar ensnarements in outcroppings of mud and other sediments. ' Bob Dole needs your help. Bob Dole requires your assistance in getting Bob Dole off this sandbar,'  the candidate repeatedly called to his far-off handlers, who yesterday evening continued to debate the best way to extricate Dole from his sandy prison. ' Bob Dole is badly stuck in this mud and unable to get free. Bob Dole is going to be the next president of the United States!'  Rescue workers were sent Thursday to remove Dole from the mud, but his blade had sunk so far into the sediment that both chains and simple manpower proved inadequate. A dredger was brought up from St. Louis Friday, but was too large and cumbersome to perform effectively in the shallow waters, its heavy chains too far out of the reach of Dole' s famous Extendo-Grip Super Action Armûûb. ' We considered separating Dole from the motor and just leaving it there, but try explaining to our fundraisers why we scuttled a $250,000 component,'  Dole campaign manager and chief mechanic Buddy Faust said. ' True, we could dismantle Dole to minimize the risk of structural trauma, but it would take a full month to reconstruct him, and he has a stump speech on Wednesday in Pittsburgh.'  The Clinton campaign was critical of Dole' s handlers for letting their candidate be used as a means of transportation. ' First they said they were going to limit his use to presidential campaigning and metal cutting,'  Clinton campaign official Trent Pauls said. ' Then they added threshing, cement mixing, and soda vending. Now apparently he' s the Mississippi Queen. Bob Dole can' t be all things to all people. When is this gentleman going to finally get down to the business of serious presidential campaigning, address the issues that concern Americans and stop permitting rogue cardsharks and ladies of ill repute to board him?'

42,Area Consumers Consume Area,"BRIXTON, MA' Hungry to possess as many consumer goods as possible, Brixton area consumers consumed the entire Brixton area yesterday, leaving only a barren, rocky swath of dead earth in their wake. The consumption marked the end of a massive consumer binge in which Brixton residents have indulged, like most Americans, since the end of World War II. Brixton, formerly an affluent semi-professional suburban community noted for its readily available office space and burgeoning retail market outlets, is now known only as ' The Scorched Infertile Earth That Once Was Brixton.'  Economists see the town' s desolation as a positive economic indicator, signifying healthy markets and a renewed willingness of American consumers to continue to consume. The figures support that projection: The consumer spending quotient was up 650 percent, local retailers'  sales figures were up 800 percent, and the consumer satisfaction index was up nearly 1000 percent. According to a statement from the office of Brixton Mayor Herb Jarzemsky, ' Forget for the moment that our once green and budding town is now a lifeless stretch of exposed terrestrial core, with no possibility of habitation or growth of flora. This mass consumption has pushed all leading economic indicators through the roof, and we' re very encouraged by that.'  Jarzemsky could not be reached for comment as of press time, as he had himself also been consumed. The rest of the statement was also unavailable, as it had been consumed as well. ' Consumer morale indexes have never been higher, and I feel the message is clear: The American consumer is once again on the move!'  President Clinton told cheering crowds at the Consumer Confidence Conference in Schaumburg, IL, yesterday. Though Clinton was referring to the projected economic boom he hopes will boost his reelection bid, the words ' on the move'  also referred to the gigantic, nomadic tribe of voracious former Brixtonian consumers currently headed west toward Wilfordchester, leaving a mile-wide stretch of smoky, barren terrain behind them. An unofficial report from a source within the Wilfordchester Chamber of Commerce revealed that the consumer mass, which is moving at a rate of 1.7 miles per day, is expected to reach the heavily populated Wilfordchester metropolitan area by mid-August, wreaking environmental havoc like a powerful tornado. ' We look forward to the arrival of the devouring horde,'  Commerce Secretary Maureen Laughlin said. ' I wouldn' t go so far as to say our economy has been sluggish, but we could certainly use a boost, and being laid waste by the horde should put our numbers up where they belong.'  Massive evacuation plans for the community ' have not been ruled out,'  according to Massachusetts Gov. William Weld. But such plans may not be necessary: A covert airlift operation is currently flooding the grasslands directly in front of the mobile consumer mass with high-quality consumer goods provided by a number of Massachusetts area merchants, including Yammush & Simms and Filene' s Basement. ' We are excited about the opportunity to provide the Brixton Mobile Consumer Mass with the high-quality, reasonably priced merchandise it has come to expect from Yammush & Simms, helping both save the town of Wilfordchester and stimulate further consumption,'  Yammush & Simms customer relations spokesperson Kent Grant said. ' We also look forward to being part of this exciting economic surge by being consumed ourselves.'  The Massachusetts National Guard has been put on red alert in the event that consumption-related devastation reaches into neighboring states.","local, archive, news, vol 29 issue 21, local"

44,A Message from the Publisher: Let Me Tell You a Thing or Two About Love,"Recently' I think it was 1931' I fell in love. It was my only time. I was a young newspaperman. She was a third-draft copy reader. Her name was Agnes. Now, many of my cognitive processes have been laid waste by my crippling Parkinson' s Disease and occasional scurvy, so many of the details of my account will be sketchy. Also, as I pause to urinate' as I must do repetitively and without the aid of my sphincter due to my cancerous growth' I may wail in excruciating pain, and thus uncontrollably misconstrue the facts of this touching story. It was a Monday in June, 1931. The day' s newspaper was rushed to my hospital bed by a young runner for my final approval. It was there I saw my love. Suddenly, there is a firestorm in my loins! I' m excreting searing needles, I' m certain of it. In 1931 I believe I was urinating without pain. So yes, this is not part of the story. This is happening now. Nurse! God damn you, rat bag! Where are you? It was in the pages of that newspaper that I saw my love: an exquisite use of a verb transitive in a parenthetical clause set off by commas. The object was placed just right, two prepositional phrases after the main verb, topped off by the unconventional yet bold use of a shocking gerund. ' Who wrote this, boy?'  I asked the runner. The fresh-faced boy was startled at first, his pink cheeks flush with fear and indecision. I finally gleaned that the phrase had been sculpted by a copy reader named Agnes. I never met Agnes. Never wanted to. I had seen the fruit of her beauty' her words. And that' s all I wanted to see. I can hear my urine dribbling lightly into the bed pan, now. Not so much of a urine-related odor. It' s mostly blood and liver bile passing through my urethra anyway. The pain is gone, for now. Where is that nurse? Wench! You dumb animal! See to me! I never saw Agnes or her work again. That is why I love journalism. It' s the words business. T. Herman Zweibel, the great grandson of Onion founder Friedrich Siegfried Zweibel, was born in 1868, became editor of The Onion at age 20, and persisted in various editorial posts until his launching into space in 2001. Zweibel's name became synonymous with American business success in the 20th century. Many consider him the ' Father Of American Journalism,'  also the title of his well-known 1943 biography, written by Norman Rombauer.","opinion, archive, commentary, vol 29 issue 21, t. herman zweibel, the onion"

46,Vincenzo Brothers Give Federal Government Five Days to Pay Off National Debt,"James and Vito Vincenzo, brothers and co-owners of Vincenzo Family Construction and Waste Removal Corporation of Long Island, NY, announced Monday they will give the U.S. government five days to fully repay the national debt. Though the two brothers declined to specify what would happen if the government failed to repay its $4.1 trillion debt, they did imply that a failure to do so would be ' extremely unfortunate.'  ' We are so terribly disappointed in the government' s continued inability to repay our loan, a loan we made in good faith,'  said Vito Vincenzo at Monday' s press conference. ' We have been owed this money since the early 1950s and are beginning to grow impatient. Should we not receive full payment in the allotted five days, I am afraid the consequences will likely be out of our hands.'  ' We love this country very much,'  added James Vincenzo, Vito' s younger brother. ' Nearly as much as we love our own dear mother Celeste Vincenzo' God rest her soul' and beautiful Sicily. So we would be greatly saddened if some of America' s more beautiful buildings and landmarks were to collapse due to a series of, let' s just say, unfortunate accidents. Like that Grand Canyon. That' s a real nice piece of land' I would certainly hate to see anything happen to it.'  At a press conference yesterday, President Clinton, sporting casts on his legs due to a ' nasty spill down the stairs,'  addressed the matter. ' We are working hard to repay the Vincenzo brothers as quickly as possible,'  he said. ' I value these two respectable businessmen and their spirit of giving and patience. James and Vito, if you are listening, I am working with Congress to cut several major welfare programs and restructure the federal tax brackets as we speak, and I am confident we should have at least $450 billion for you by Friday.'  Though Clinton promised to repay the debt in full, he noted that the majority of it is Ronald Reagan' s fault and strongly encouraged the Vincenzo brothers to ' pay the 40th president a small visit'  at his San Fernando Valley nursing home/ranch. ' Mr. Clinton is a very nice man for saying these things. A very nice man,'  Vito Vincenzo said. ' Were it up to me, I would just forget the whole thing. But unfortunately it just isn' t like that. We love Mr. Clinton and his beautiful wife Hillary. And that precious little Chelsea is just a doll. It would be tragic if she were to disappear on the way home from school only to turn up several months later in a dumpster in Passaic, New Jersey. That would be a real shame.'  Whether the government can gather together the money in the allotted time is in serious question. However, many other respectable business families, including the Salvatores, the Gambinos and the Gottis, have stepped forward with offers to loan the government the needed money at a reasonable interest rate. The Vincenzo family has a long history of providing loans to people and organizations in need since arriving in the U.S. in the early 1920s, boasting a client list that includes many heads of government and captains of industry. The mantle of leadership has since been passed down from father to son, ending up in James and Vito' s hands in 1967, when their father was killed in a freak shooting accident. The Vincenzo loans that led up to the current government debt began in 1953, and have since been used for the purchase of critically needed military equipment, arms for Central American democratic rebels and new traffic signs throughout the Midwest.","economy, archive, news, vol 29 issue 21, the onion"

' Honestly, what' s the problem? I' d be flattered if some girl blocked my path on the sidewalk, grabbed her crotch, and told me my big slutty lips would look great on her pussy.

The American condiment community reacted with shock Monday when the U.S. Department of Natural Resources announced that the nation' s natural mayonnaise reserves, long thought sufficient to carry the country into the 21st century, are, in fact, running dangerously low. ' Because of record heat in the Southwest basin, the outer layer of our national reserves spoiled prematurely,'  DNR spokesperson David Korking said.

The DNR warned that the mile-deep wells that line the Pacific coast as well as the Gulf of Mexico, now must be tested extensively before being tapped and imported to U.S. processing plants. The DNR did unveil a plan to scoop and dump all spoiled mayonnaise into deep space, while at the same time stepping up measures to drill the forests of Alaska for fresh wells. As of market-closing Tuesday, mayonnaise prices were up over four dollars per drum. The Associated Press contributed to this story.","science & technology, archive, news, vol 29 issue 21, the onion"

60,Amish Give Up,"""This is bullshit,"" Elders Say LANCASTER, PA' After centuries of enduring harsh, spare living conditions and voluntarily shunning modern amenities such as microwave ovens and red clothing, Amish leaders announced Monday that Amish across the U.S. will abandon their traditional ways and adapt to modern American life. ' Fuck that,'  said Amish Father Ezekiel Schmid at a Lancaster press conference. ' This is pure bullshit.'  Schmid recounted the hard Amish life, in which many long hours are spent toiling under the hot sun in heavy black clothing without any refrigerated drinks or gas-powered farm machines. He spoke of the arduous task of raising barns by hand from dawn until dusk, and of laboriously churning his own butter without electrical power. ' I can' t believe we were such suckers,'  Schmid said. ' I feel like a fool.'  Schmid added that he will shave off his ' ridiculous'  Pennsylvania Dutch-style beard with no mustache, a look he says went out of fashion in ' about 1820.'  ' Why didn' t anyone ever tell me how stupid I looked?'  he said. According to Schmid, the Amish look forward to a wide variety of ' alternative lifestyle'  opportunities that now await them. ' I am indeed looking forward to wearing clothing that is a color other than black,'  said Josephat Kreugger, a prominent Kruegger, an Amish counsel member. ' I will try on some dark gray suits, perhaps even medium gray. I am also considering buying a charcoal-colored hat.'  Kreugger also expressed a desire to travel ' twice the speed of horse.'  Many social changes await the Amish, as well. ' When I punish my son for not saying his prayers,'  Mary Wittgenstein said, ' I normally use a wooden switch taken from a tree. But now, think of the modern child-beating weapons that will be available to me in the outside world. Perhaps there are whips made especially for use on disobedient children, or muskets.'  Many Amish are looking forward to getting jobs in the real world. Amish farmer Abraham Verveert said he has greatly entertained other Amish people at church meetings with his rousing scripture readings, and hopes to capitalize on that talent by taking his Bible-reading on the road. ' I have readings scheduled at nightclubs and ballrooms across the country, and judging by the gleeful reaction of my Amish brethren, I believe I will find great success entertaining outsiders with my lively readings,'  Verveert said. ' This week, I will be reading a particularly delightful passage from Corinthians at the Sunrise Motor Inn in Kew Gardens, NY. You will surely want to be present.'  One Amish couple, Jacob and Sarah Neamer, plan to move to an apartment in a major city and adopt a modern lifestyle, but will continue to make a living the only way they know how. ' We will charge admission for people to enter our home and observe our lifestyle,'  Sarah said. ' For $12.50, or $10 with coupon, you can watch us as we cook meals and watch the television.'  One Amish entrepreneur, Lucas Hagen, is looking forward to taking full advantage of modern technology. ' I was often ostracized in the Amish community for my blasphemous ideas about loosening Amish traditions,'  he said. ' Now that I am free to explore life on the outside, I plan to buy a cable TV station and create an Amish Porn Channel.'  If successful, Hagen' s Amish Porn Channel will feature programs in which women take off their bonnets and expose their hair. Amish Father Schmid is looking forward to being a policeman.

A comprehensive, long-term examination of the career paths of over 4,500 broads from across the U.S., the study indicates that broads are earning 15 percent more on average and are twice as likely to be in positions of upper management than just 10 years ago. ' This is a tremendously exciting, very promising report,'  said Stan Cullums, director of UC-Berkeley' s famed Institute For Gender Research, which conducted the study. ' After several decades of status quo and periodic retrenchment, it would appear that broads are finally beginning to make strides toward equality in the workplace.'  The Institute' s survey revealed that the average earned income for broads relative to men rose from 64 cents on the dollar to 77 cents. Average salaries for professional broads also rose, from $21,500 to almost $24,000. According to Institute spokespeople, those numbers are the result of a steadily increasing number of broads in the upper ranks of American corporations. ' In 1985, among Fortune 500 companies, there were only a handful of broads occupying top positions,'  said Harvey Bollings, the Institute' s Director of Research. ' In the past few years, however, we have really begun to see some major changes.'  Despite the Institute' s enthusiasm, many experts warn the numbers are deceiving. ' Yes, there are more broads than ever working in the upper ranks of corporate America,'  said R. Nelson Sommers, head of Washington, D.C.' s prestigious Hastings Foundation, an independent think-tank. ' But in terms of real power, there is quite another story. Today, only two of America' s top 500 corporations are headed by broads.'  In addition to collecting raw economic data, the Berkeley study also questioned broads about their feelings toward their position in the American workplace. Overall, broads were optimistic about their prospects for the future, confident that opportunities for them would continue to increase. Three of every five broads surveyed responded ' yes'  to the question, ' Careerwise, do you broads feel you have a better chance of achieving your goals than you would have 10 years ago?'  Survey respondents were also generally optimistic about their ability to balance career and family, with 57 percent of those polled responding ' no'  to the question, ' Will you broads have to sacrifice your careers in order to have a family and children?'  Nevertheless, the vast majority of broads, approximately nine out of 10, still believe that men have an overwhelming advantage when competing for jobs. ' We have so much more to prove in a job situation than men do,'  said Jocelyn Kane, some broad from Maryland who participated in the survey. ' Men instantly give each other respect. There' s still a big ' old boys club'  mentality looming in the business world.'  Cullums agreed: ' A lot of the broads I know find the job market very unfriendly toward their kind.'  The Institute For Gender Research plans to follow up its study over the course of the next 10 years, periodically tracking changes in both income and attitudes for all broads who participated. ' This is the most comprehensive survey of its kind, both in terms of numbers and longevity,'  Cullums said. ' We already have a remarkably clear and detailed picture of the broad' s work experience here in the United States. Our future research will only add to that.'

62,'Entertainment Weekly' Utilizes Pun in Article About Tom Cruise,"NEW YORK' It is a mere two weeks after the release of the summer blockbuster Mission: Impossible, and Lori Skedelesky, an associate editor at Entertainment Weekly, can claim responsibility for one of the most clever turns of phrase in recent journalistic history: ' Cruise Control.'  ' I' m very proud of it,'  says Skedelesky of the headline, which appeared in the summer movie preview issue of the magazine. ' I was sitting around racking my brains, when all of a sudden it occurred to me that [the actor]' s last name seemed somehow familiar to me. On a hunch, I looked it up in a dictionary. Sure enough, I found it' and not just as a proper noun, but as a regular noun and a verb.'  The dictionary hunt proved a bonanza for Skedelesky, who discovered to her amazement that ' cruise'  not only is a word in its own right, but also forms part of many ' phrases,'  or groups of words commonly used together. One of these was ' cruise control,'  which Skedelesky notes is ' a feature in modern automobiles that allows them to maintain a constant speed.'  But what relevance does an automotive convenience have to the mega-star of Losin'  It and Taps? That' s where Skedelesky' s training as a journalist came into play. The tenacious Skedelesky, following her instincts and the lead of popular literary critics like Jacques Derrida and Cindy Adams, decided to take the phrase ' cruise control'  and deconstruct it into its constituent parts' namely, ' cruise'  and ' control.'  When she did' presto! ' It was a real ' Eureka!'  moment,'  says Skedelesky, who earned her stripes at Columbia University' s School of Journalism and TV Guide. ' He' s not only the star of the movie, but its producer. Now, everyone knows that producers have a lot of power, or control, over a film. So, the kind of power the producer of Mission: Impossible has is ' cruise control.'  Capitalize the two words, and you have a very concise way of expressing the motif of the article.'  But ' conciseness isn' t its only virtue,'  notes Harold Bloom, Professor Emeritus of Literature at Yale University. ' To those readers already familiar with the phrase ' cruise control'  from its usual context, the sudden realization of its applicability in an entirely different area of human experience will send a frisson of delight through their veins, in recognition of the principle of synchronicity at once so ubiquitous yet so hidden in our daily lives.'  The modest Skedelesky admits that the rest of Entertainment Weekly' s staff is abuzz over her work. In fact, her boss, senior editor Denise Bankman, told reporters that associate editors usually don' t have the experience to come up with headlines by themselves, but that they are encouraged to ' pitch'  ideas at the creative meetings each week. ' To expect that level of idea from an associate editor is unrealistic,'  Bankman says. ' But every now and then, one of them strikes gold. Right after she came to me with the idea, I told Lori, ' Welcome to the big leagues.' '  But beyond the 152-person editorial staff of the magazine, the two-word masterpiece earned Skedelesky an even bigger fan' Mr. Cruise Control himself! ' He called me yesterday,'  blushes Skedelesky. ' Well, not really. It was his publicist' s assistant, and she said how much Mr. Cruise enjoyed the article and thanked me for doing my part to make the movie a success. He' s incredibly down-to-earth.'  Fresh off her ' headline-making'  success with Tom Cruise, Skedelesky has been assigned another celebrity-profile article, this time of Friends'  David Schwimmer. Skedelesky says ' mum' s the word'  about the headline of the Schwimmer piece, but she assures us that it goes ' even further into the realm of wordplay,'  and adds cryptically, ' People who use pools to exercise will particularly enjoy it.'

63,Winning Father's Day Essay: My Dad Beats Me Because He Loves Me,"By Jeffrey Helms, age 8 My daddy is the best daddy ever and I will tell you why. He beats me, that' s why. He shows me that he loves me by beating me. That is okay because everyone has a different way of showing someone that they love them. (That' s what my mommy says.) My daddy shows his love with his closed fists. I love my dad. But I don' t beat him. I show love by hugging people. Different people show love in different ways. Whenever I hug my dad, he beats me. I asked my mommy why daddy hits me so much, and she said it was because he loves me. I asked her why it had to hurt so much and she cried, like she always does, and said that sometimes love hurts. One time I even had to go to the hospital because mommy was afraid daddy broke my collar bone. It feels good to know that I am loved so much that it could cause me to go to the hospital. My daddy also has a special love smell. My mommy says it' s from what my daddy drinks when he goes to the bar. But every time my daddy shows me he loves me, I smell that special smell that tells me that I am loved. If you counted all the times my daddy hits me, it' s a lot. Since each time he beats me it means he loves me, then he loves me up to four to five times per day. I must be a very lucky child. My mommy is scared, though. My daddy beats her also. He beats her even more than he beats me. My daddy must love my mommy a lot. I guess that' s why they decided to get married. Sometimes my daddy likes to beat me when we' re at the dinner table eating. My daddy will get out of his chair and hit me in the face and on the head over and over until my mommy starts crying and yelling at him. Then he hits her. After that, we go and watch TV together. So I belong in a very loving family, since we have more than our share of love beatings to go around. One time when we went to the emergency clinic because mommy thought daddy had caused a blood vessel to burst in my eye, there was some lady there who told my daddy that he may be in violation of state penal code 22(ii) sec. 3.j., which is a law. I don' t know what that all means. All I know is that my daddy loves me. My daddy yelled at the lady and asked her, ' You don' t think I love my kid?'  and, ' You don' t think I' m good enough to be the kid' s dad?'  and questions like that. I knew that he loved me because he was sticking up for me. We got out of that hospital very fast. Someday I hope my eye will heal. Next time your daddy ever hits you, tell him that you love him back even though it hurts to be loved. And you should hope that when you grow up you can get married to somebody who loves you just as much as my daddy loves me so you can have the same loving home for your kids that I have.","opinion, archive, commentary, vol 29 issue 20, the onion"
64,Childless Couple Adopts Dwarf," Can They Do That?'  Says Dwarf When Michael and Elaine Fendover married in June 1989, life seemed perfect for the young couple. With their respective careers in food additive management and motivational aerobic therapy on the rise and a wonderful home in the Pacific Northwest, the Fendovers felt ' blessed.'  Yet, within a few years, it became apparent that all was not well in the their lives: After several failed attempts, it was confirmed by doctors that the couple could not conceive children, and a dark cloud fell across the pair' s life together. Now, all that has changed. Happily picking safety pins from her teeth, Elaine smiles as she begins to lovingly diaper Ed, the newest member of the Fendover clan. Daintily powdering his tiny feet and bottom, she chuckles to herself in sing-song baby talk: ' Who' s got a witty-bitty tummy-tum-tum? Who' s got a teeny-weeny pair of footie-wooties? Oh, yes, you do!'  An unusual scenario? Hardly. Yet something is different about the Fendover household. You see, Ed is an adult male dwarf, 48 years of age. ' Help me,'  Ed silently mouths to reporters. ' These people are insane. I want to go back to my wife.'  ' I want only to make our little Eddie happy,'  says Elaine in response to the oft-repeated criticisms of dwarves'  rights groups nationwide, which have demanded that Ed, a Pomona, CA, computer repair technician and amateur model rocketry hobbyist, be set free. ' Don' t they understand that we give him everything a little one could ever want? We spoil our little Eddie, and dote on him hand and foot.'  Elaine points to the nursery, where the disgruntled man, clad in a baby bonnet and booties, sits amid piles of plush stuffed animals and colorful plastic playthings, quietly writing letters to his wife with a brand-new, 128-count box of Crayola crayons. Before he gets a chance to mail the letters, like all the ones before them, they will be seized and destroyed. ' You don' t understand how hard it is to be without a little one of your very own to share your life with,'  says Michael Fendover, pushing Ed' s tricycle along the driveway. ' These dwarf groups don' t know the sorrow, the painE€¦'  He breaks down, overcome with emotion. Within seconds, the silent dwarf is racing toward the end of the driveway in a desperate bid for freedom. ' Bad Ed!'  cries Michael, regaining his composure, striding after the frantically pedaling Ed. Although the hapless dwarf exerts himself, Michael' s long legs overtake the tricycle easily. ' You' re in big trouble, young man!'  says Michael as he carries the wiggling, kicking dwarf back inside for a spanking. A subsequent search uncovers two bus transfers hidden in Ed' s Li' l Slugger baseball cap. Perhaps, after reaching the street, he had hoped to catch a crosstown bus home. ' We love Ed,'  says Elaine, hugging the man Newsweek called ' The Pint-sized Prisoner'  to her bosom, forcing her nipple into his mouth in a semblance of breast feeding. ' And we' re never giving him u","local, archive, news, vol 29 issue 20, local"

68,Bantu Tribesman Uses IBM Global Uplink Network Modem to Crush Nut,"KABINDA, ZAIRE' In a move IBM officials are hailing as a major step in the company' s ongoing worldwide telecommunications revolution, M' wana Ndeti, a member of Zaire' s Bantu tribe, used an IBM global uplink network modem yesterday to crush a nut. Ndeti, who spent 20 minutes trying to open the nut by hand, easily cracked it open by smashing it repeatedly with the powerful modem. ' I could not crush the nut by myself,'  said the 47-year-old Ndeti, who added the savory nut to a thick, peanut-based soup minutes later. ' With IBM' s help, I was able to break it.'  Ndeti discovered the nut-breaking, 28.8 V.34 modem yesterday, when IBM was shooting a commercial in his southwestern Zaire village. During a break in shooting, which shows African villagers eagerly teleconferencing via computer with Japanese schoolchildren, Ndeti snuck onto the set and took the modem, which he believed would serve well as a ' smashing'  utensil. Just after Ndeti shattered the nut, a 200-person Southern Baptist gospel choir, on hand for the taping of the IBM commercial, broke out into raucous, joyous song in celebration of the tribesman' s accomplishment. IBM officials were not surprised the longtime computer giant was able to provide Ndeti with practical solutions to his everyday problems. ' Our telecommunications systems offer people all over the world global networking solutions that fit their specific needs,'  said Herbert Ross, IBM' s director of marketing. ' Whether you' re a nun cloistered in an Italian abbey or an Aborigine in Australia' s Great Sandy Desert, IBM has the ideas to get you where you want to go today.'  According to Ndeti, of the modem' s many powerful features, most impressive was its hard plastic casing, which easily sustained several minutes of vigorous pounding against a large stone. ' I put the nut on a rock, and I hit it with the modem,'  Ndeti said. ' The modem did not break. It is a good modem.'  Ndeti was so impressed with the modem that he purchased a new, state-of-the-art IBM workstation, complete with a PowerPC 601 microprocessor, a quad-speed internal CD-ROM drive and three 16-bit ethernet networking connectors. The tribesman has already made good use of the computer system, fashioning a gazelle trap out of its wires, a boat anchor out of the monitor and a crude but effective weapon from its mouse. ' This is a good computer,'  said Ndeti, carving up a just-captured gazelle with the computer' s flat, sharp internal processing device. ' I am using every part of it. I will cook this gazelle on the keyboard.'  Hours later, Ndeti capped off his delicious gazelle dinner by smoking the computer' s 200-page owner' s manual. IBM spokespeople praised Ndeti' s choice of computers. ' We are pleased that the Bantu people are turning to IBM for their business needs,'  said company CEO William Allaire. ' From Kansas City to Kinshasa, IBM is bringing the world closer together. Our cutting-edge technology is truly creating a global village.'  The Bantu tribesmen are members of an ever-growing, international community of users who have turned to IBM to solve their networking needs. Jean-Claude DuMont, a goatherder from the French region of Brittany who is working on an Indiana University Ph.D. in biology via internet, recently looked into IBM' s new computer-satellite data uplink, which offers instant access to all library files worldwide. ' With IBM' s new uplink service, I can access any file I want, any time I want,'  DuMont told fellow goatherder Pierre Valmont during a recent walk through a rye field. ' I can even find out how many points Michael Jordan scored last night.'  Responded Valmont: ' Radical.' ","science & technology, archive, news, vol 29 issue 20, the onion"

76,Colorado Judge Imposes Ban On Same-Sex Friendships,"In a landmark decision being watched closely by both civil liberties advocates and people who have friends, Colorado Fifth District Judge Stephen T. Rozema yesterday upheld a ban on same-sex friendships in the state of Colorado. The decision, which effectively outlaws ' casual, consensual, mutually friendly relationships between two individuals of the same gender,'  is expected to have a major impact on the legality of same-sex friendships across the U.S. The controversial decision is based on the case of Greeley, CO, residents John Rooney and Frank Costanada, two friends who were planning a weekend rock-climbing trip to Yosemite National Park this July. After their travel agent informed local authorities that she suspected they were friends, a local appellate court blocked the trip, deeming it ' wholly inappropriate.'  ' These two men were in great danger of enjoying each other' s company,'  the judge said. ' They may have attempted to communicate meaningfully with each other, shared stories and anecdotes, or possibly even engaged in physical contact, such as ' high-fiving'  after a successful climb.'  ' Such behavior,'  the judge added, ' is an abomination.'  Judge Rozema expounded on the lower court decision, ruling that ' these sorts of close, mutually agreeable relations between two men are not what God had in mind when he created Adam and Eve.'  He later added, ' This is why they weren' t called Adam and Steve.'  While conservatives are applauding the Colorado decision, many believe it does not go far enough. U.S. Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-SC) recently called for the ban to extend to same-sex conversations, calling them ' unnatural.'  Thurmond is also the author of the much-discussed Proposition D, which would outlaw same-sex locker rooms. ' Men should be showering with women, not other men. Though if they do shower together, they should be legally married before God.'  Two states, Missouri and Louisiana, have already made same-sex locker rooms illegal, instituting a mandatory co-ed policy that requires all showerers to be paired up with a partner of the opposite sex and be legally married before entering the bathing area. Kansas City resident Jennifer Jacobs, 34, was recently wed before showering at her health club with Gene Skellings, a 63-year-old executive from the suburb of Mitchell Park. ' I wanted to work out and then take a shower,'  Jacobs said. ' But in accordance with the law, I married Mr. Skellings and will serve him as my husband for the rest of my life.'  President Clinton, who, despite supporting same-sex friendships in the 1992 campaign, calling them ' valuable and nurturing bonds that fit the definition of acceptable behavior as prescribed by the Lord Christ in Heaven,'  was pleased by the judge' s decision. ' I very much support eight-to-ten person same-sex gatherings, such as ladies'  bridge groups or men' s poker nights,'  said Clinton, who confessed to playing in a monthly high-stakes poker game with top generals and heads of the military industrial establishment. ' Two men alone, though' no way.'  Despite President Clinton' s support, rumors persist that Clinton himself has engaged in a friendship with former U.S. Energy Secretary James McEwen, with whom he has periodically been seen eating lunch. ' Mr. McEwen is an associate of mine, and our lunches are strictly strategy sessions,'  Clinton said. Clinton did not deny, however, that when playing golf with McEwen, they sometimes walk ahead of Secret Service agents and are briefly alone, a practice that has prompted many to question Clinton' s suitability as a moral leader. The Colorado ban is expected to pave the way for other states, many of which have similar legislation pending. Conservatives are working hard to not only ban same-sex friendships on a national basis, but also to outlaw any asexual reproduction in the single-cell invertebrate community. ' These filthy and immoral invertebrates are not acting in accordance with the Bible and, by His holy Word, must be put to death,'  Thurmond said.","politics, archive, gay & lesbian, courts, news, vol 29 issue 20, politics"
77,Clinton Breaks Off Talks with Carpetland,"Washington, D.C. ' After months of deteriorating relations, President Clinton yesterday announced that the U.S. has broken off talks with Carpetland and its friendly, helpful team of sales associates. The break, which came after an 11th hour disagreement over the terms of the installation of 300 square yards of DuPont Stainmaster II, could leave Clinton without quality carpeting for the November election. The decision to break off talks came at the insistence of several of Clinton' s top advisors, including U.S. Carpet Secretary Daniel Attenbisen, who said a proposed U.S. Monsanto-brand Weardated purchase now would be unwise, as it is too late for the summer selection. The fall double-knit line is widely reported to be the weakest in years. Attenbisen served as Carpetland ambassador under President Ford. Leonard Haveshbaum, Customer Service Representative to the U.S., was regretful over the stalled negotiations and expressed determination to restore good relations with the U.S. ' President Clinton is a valued customer,'  said Haveshbaum, speaking from Carpetland' s brand-new store at Pflaum Road and Highway 351. ' He is welcome to visit any one of our 21 convenient D.C.-area Carpetland locations at any time, should he make a firm decision on his carpet and carpet-related needs.'  Added Haveshbaum: ' Our low prices will floor you.'  Despite the break in talks, Clinton stressed the importance of U.S.-Carpetland relations in a formal statement released yesterday. ' I believe in Carpetland and what it can offer the American people. I believe that only the highest quality carpets at the lowest possible factory-outlet prices should be purchased,'  the statement read. ' Carpetland and the U.S. were allies in the Fourth of July Carpet Blow-Out of 1968, and on through to the Shag Crisis of the mid-' 70s. I would like to assure the American public that the impasse reached in these talks in no way lessens our commitment to the people of Carpetland.'  Clinton has not ruled out bombing Carpetland. Though the White House tried to head off any speculation as to why Clinton broke off the talks, one report hinted that there had been no agreement on the particulars of a White House-wide free-installation accord. Others speculated that Carpetland was holding out on the free Stainguard treatment given to all customers who purchase 100 square feet or more. There was also concern that Clinton low-balled Haveshbaum and then offered assurance that Carpetland' s Labor Day Carpet Sale-abration would be granted Most-Favored-Sale status by the U.S.' something no president has done since Grover Cleveland. The White House made sure to inform the press yesterday that color was not a factor in the decision, and supported this claim by passing around a DuPont Stainmaster II sample book complete with the President' s pre-approved colors. With talks on hold, Clinton has not stood still in the quest for quality carpet at discount prices, urging his Joint Chiefs to recommend another carpet store in the area. The Joint Chiefs are expected to recommend that Clinton call Crazy Hal' s Carpet and Tile Warehouse, where, according to a recent Pentagon report, the lowest prices are guaranteed. There is some concern among senior officials, however, that Crazy Hal' s prices are low only because Crazy Hal may be clinically insane, and therefore lacks the necessary cognitive powers to determine a fair price for carpets, tiles, and other floor coverings. ' I am aware that Crazy Hal is considered ' insane'  to sell carpet at the low, low prices he does,'  Clinton said Monday, speaking at the Naval Academy' s Commencement in Annapolis, MD. ' If Crazy Hal is indeed mentally unsound, we will consider a course of action appropriate for dealing with an insane person in the arena of discount carpet.'

82,Hard Times Hit Springsteenville,"SPRINGSTEENVILLE, U.S.A.' Across America, cities are facing shrinking job bases and plant closings. But nowhere has the recent industrial slowdown hit harder than Springsteenville. A blue-collar, rust-belt city whose 75,000 inhabitants are almost all factory-employed Vietnam veterans, Springsteenville was once considered an ideal American town, but now faces a state of economic emergency. ' Our glory days have passed us by,'  says Mayor Joe Roberts, whose parents came to Springsteenville in 1951 to work in the city' s then-booming auto plant. ' The situation is similar to the wink of a young girl' s eye.'  With the recent closing of Springsteenville' s textile mill, located across the railroad tracks, unemployment has hit an all-time high of 34 percent. ' It seems like there' s always another plant closing down,'  Roberts lamented. ' Once we stood for a hard day' s work for a day' s pay. But now, these jobs are going, boys. And they ain' t coming back.'  ' To your hometown,'  the mayor continued. ' Your hometown.'  Unemployment is at an all-time high in Springsteenville, and it appears that spirits have never been lower. Most of the city' s workers served their country bravely in the 1960s and ' 70s, when, after getting in a little hometown jam, they had rifles thrust into their hands. ' I was sent to a foreign land,'  said Kyle Braley, who works on the highway in nearby Darlington County. ' To go and kill the yellow man.'  In the 1980s, Springsteenville was a symbol of working-class pride and patriotic vigor, but by 1996, Springsteenville has seen better days and is increasingly in danger of becoming a sad caricature of its former self. One petroleum worker (who asked not to be named) said that upon returning from Vietnam he had gone back to the refinery, but the hiring officer refused him, saying that, son, it was unfortunately not up to him. The veteran then tried approaching his V.A. man, who similarly replied, ' Son, don' t you understand?'  Adding to Springsteenville' s woes is the recent drastic rise in teen delinquency. Fueled by the perception among youth that the city is both a death trap and a suicide rap, many teens are getting out while they are young. Underage drinking is an epidemic and teen pregnancy is at an all-time high, as many high school-age teens go down to the river, despite the fact that the river is dry. Some teens are proving it all night, typically out in the street. Others, such as local teens Bobby Jean, Wendy and Rosalita, have opted simply to run away. One disaffected factory worker told reporters that life in Springsteenville makes him feel as if someone took an edgy, dull knife and cut a six-inch valley through the middle of his soul. He also noted that he is on fire. Compounding Springsteenville' s economic woes are the city' s tremendous traffic problems, with many residents turning to their automobiles as a way out. Among the most popular auto-related escapes: driving all night, racing in the street, cruising on the oft-visited Thunder Road, and driving either stolen or used cars. ' It' s true,'  Mayor Roberts confirms. ' Our highways are jammed with broken heroes on a last-chance power drive. This is terrible, and not just because of the risk of a tragic wreck on the highway. We can' t have kids thinking that they can skip some school, shoot some pool, act real cool, stay out all night, and it will be all right.'  The rising tide of hopelessness among Springsteenville' s young has contributed to an equally swift rise in the crime rate. Residents of the suburbs are afraid to go out at night, largely due to a recent, much-publicized freeze-out on 10th Avenue. ' I was stranded in the jungle trying to take in all the heat they was giving,'  recalled victim Bad Scooter, speaking from his hospital bed. ' I then turned around the corner, and things got extremely quiet, extremely fast.'  Police are still investigating the incident.

83,Award-Winning News Team Keeps Southern Iowa Man In Touch With Southern Iowa,"DES MOINES, IA' With its accurate, up-to-the-minute coverage of local news, weather and sports, the award-winning News-6 team keeps Southern Iowa TV viewer Cal Fenert in touch with Southern Iowa, it was learned yesterday. According to Fenert, ' I feel that I can depend on News-6.'  The Des Moines-based News-6, broadcast on local ABC affiliate KNZR, airs nightly at both 6 and 10. ' This means that if I miss the 6 o-clock news,'  Fenert said, ' I can stay in touch by tuning in to a wrap-up of the news that shapes my world at 10.'  Fenert, a retired auto worker, added: ' I look forward to joining anchorpersons Melanie Washbeyer and Jeff Crim, as well as meteorologist Steve Schaffer, with Bob Keenan on sports.'  According to reports, Fenert had only occasionally watched local news in the past; he was not aware that News-6 was putting him in touch with Southern Iowa until he saw its promotional advertisement on TV. In the ad, the News-6 team is shown individually, sitting on stools in front of a soft-colored background accompanied by synthesized music. ' We' re keeping you in touch with Southern Iowa,'  Washbeyer says in the promo, looking away from the camera as if talking to a reporter. Said Fenert, ' I am kept in touch because the News-6 van is always on the scene when late-breaking news happens. Their experienced team of reporters is always on the NightBeat.'  Thanks to the three-time local Emmy-nominated news team, Fenert has also been kept in touch with kids and the community. ' News-6 takes time out for kids, and cares about the community,'  Fenert said. ' That' s why they feature Kid Care Mondays. And that' s also why they feature the Good Neighbor Watch, which once a week profiles someone right here in my own community who' s making a difference.'  ' We' re doing our job right if Cal Fenert feels as though he' s in touch with Southern Iowa,'  News-6 general manager Neil Roukman said. ' When Cal Fenert needs the latest coverage of local events, he can count on News-6.'  Roukman added that, like Fenert, he also cares about kids and the community. According to reports, when Fenert needs all the local sports scores, Bob Keenan of News-6 Sports provides them. ' I give Cal Fenert the latest pro and college scores and highlights, as well as update him on what' s happening in the high school scene right here in Southern Iowa,'  Keenan said. ' If you want prep basketball results, there isn' t better coverage in the whole state.'  And Fenert is kept well abreast of local weather conditions by meteorologist Steve Schaffer. ' He employs the latest Doppler radar technology to give me the dependable AccuWeather forecast I need, when I need it,'  Fenert said. Fenert reportedly was kept in touch as recently as last night, when he joined anchorpersons Washbeyer and Crim for the 10 p.m. update. ' I am glad I joined them,'  Fenert said. ' They put me in touch with the news and events that shape my world, and then they put it all in perspective.'  This, say insiders, is how News-6 can put Fenert in touch with the people and the stories that the other networks can' t. News-6 is owned by Trans-GlobalMedia Enterprises Worldwide, Inc., a multi-billion dollar company that owns 607 stations across the U.S. The company was also ruled responsible last month for the chemical spill-related deaths of 80,000 workers at its plastics factory in Dharjahal, India.","local, archive, news, vol 29 issue 18, local"
84,Jews' Covenant Up For Renewal With God,"Canaan' The sacred covenant made between Abraham and the Hebrew god Yahweh expired Monday, setting off a fierce round of re-negotiations between Jewish representatives and God's legal counsel. Area Jews are hoping for a contract similar to the one made 6,000 years ago with the Lord' a contract that not only made them God' s chosen people, but also included significant land incentives, most notably the Promised Land known today as Israel. ""If God thinks we are just going to roll over and re-sign, that's one deity that's got another thing coming,"" said Hollywood superagent Mike Ovitz, who has been called in by the Jews to negotiate. ""I want a package deal, with domestic and international rights. And this whole Arab thing, forget about it."" God's legal team declined comment. WASHINGTON' With its vote to adopt a resolution denouncing the freshman' s congresswoman behavior, the House of Representatives formally censured Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Friday for employing the sexist slur ' fucking bitch'  in a speech on the House floor the day prior. ' The representative from New York' s 14th District is hereby condemned for her unapologetic enunciation of these hateful, abusive words, which not only brought disgrace to this esteemed body but were incredibly demeaning to all womankind,'  House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said as he read aloud the official rebuke, adding that as a woman herself, Ocasio-Cortez should have known better than to speak aloud the unconscionable term, let alone read it into the Congressional Record. ' Her appalling speech of July 23 does not reflect the values of the United States Congress, nor does it reflect the example we wish to set for our children' especially our daughters. While this body will not ask what prompted her to adopt such unprofessional language, it will require the representative to issue an immediate apology to her colleagues or face further disciplinary action for her misconduct.'  In his own words, McCarthy went on to observe that it was too soon to tell just how far back Ocasio-Cortez had set ' young ladies'  in Congress with her ' hysterical'  outburst.","religion, archive, news in brief, vol 29 issue 18, the onion"
85,The State of the Neighborhood Address,"The following is an excerpt from Pearl Gaines'  State of the Neighborhood Address, given Sunday at The Crandalls'  barbecue. For a complete transcript, write in care of this newspaper. My fellow Garden Districtites: We stand on the brink of questionable times. To one side lies prosperity, joy, and the hope that certain dog owners who shall remain nameless will start picking up the ' business'  their dogs leave behind when they go on walks. To the other side lies corruption, ruin, and the total collapse of the Garden District neighborhood. How do we decide the correct path to take? We must look within ourselves. This answer is easier to find than most would think. If everyone just stood up straight and said, ' Yes!'  then this neighborhood would improve tenfold. If we all pulled together and put our trash out the night before it was supposed to be picked up, we could achieve new heights. If the citizenry would keep their shades closed while making love or going to the bathroom, our neighborhood would stand taller than ever. If the Hendersons would only repaint that awful peeling garage door and keep their music down, well thenû€f This is not to say that we have not made great strides. Lawns improved a dramatic 15 percent in the neighborhoodal 1995-96 year. All sources point toward the fact that people mowed their lawns on a more regular basis, and that we didn' t suffer from the dry spell like we did in ' 94. If we keep our eyes to the future and remember to water, mulch and rake regularly, we can continue this upswing and carry good lawns into the 21st century. But before we rejoice in this great triumph, consider those faults which still remain within our gentle burg. In February, Louise Maverly of 1401 Oak Terrace left town for four days to tend to her sick mother. While she was out, her husband Bernard had a woman there overnight. While nothing can be confirmed, from this it can be inferred that Bernard Maverly is a no-good cheat. And if this is the case, I urge each of you to have a long talk with Bernard Maverly. Commerce boomed to record highs, in part thanks to the all-neighborhood rummage sale held in the summer. People from all over town flooded our streets looking for that special bargain, and most people found it. I, myself, was able to purchase two beautiful Avon perfume bottles shaped like pirates'  muskets for only 50 cents from the McDowells. They, in turn, walked away with a beautiful painting my aunt Betty gave me for a mere $2, marked down from $5. It' s that little give-and-take that makes a neighborhood run smoothly. If only the Carters down the street would take heed to this by not undercutting my prices at the next sale, we could continue to live in harmony. That said, I must say there is a dark side to the neighborhood that is growing like a cancer. That cancer is grass clippings and moldy leaf piles. I know the difficulty of disposing of them properly. I know that it is easy to say, ' I' ll bag them tomorrow,'  especially after a hard day of mowing and raking. Well, that tomorrow never seems to come in time to prevent a pile of organic mass from reeking with rot and attracting flies. We can easily avoid this by bagging our organic materials in a timely and organized fashion. We were all saddened when Mr. Davis died suddenly at 73. His house stood vacant for three months, and the neighborhood waited nervously to see who would replace the beloved community member and father of four. Thankfully, we were pleased to welcome the Washington family to our ne","opinion, archive, commentary, vol 29 issue 18, losses and gaines pearl gaines, the onion"
86,Governor Approves 24-Hour Waiting Period For Women Voters,"MADISON, WI' In a long-awaited follow-up to the 24-hour hold on women' s checks, Gov. Tommy Thompson signed a bill yesterday requiring a 24-hour waiting period for women vo-ters. According to the bill, women will come to their polling location and receive counseling and ad-vice concerning their political selections, and will be shown pictures of both candidates to help them decide for whom they want to vote. Thompson stressed that not only do women have a ' right to know,'  but also that ' by having to make two trips to the polls, they will be less likely to make the foolish mistakes their sex is often prone to make.'  The Wisconsin Chapter of the National Orga-nization for Women pro-tested the bill with a rally outside the Capitol, claim-ing that the new measure prevents wo-men from voting, as they would be returning to the polls the day after the election. Thompson was unavailable for comment, but John Haines, his press secretary, dismissed the allegations as an emotional over-reaction typical of women. He added that the ad-ministration is looking in-to a 24-hour waiting period for ral-lies by wo-men' s groups to make sure they understand all the facts before protesting. ' Per-haps, once again, pictures could be used to assist the women in their decision-making pro-cess,'  Haines said.

88,Doritos Celebrates One Millionth Ingredient,"DALLAS, TX' Amid much fanfare, the Frito-Lay Corporation, manufacturers of the world' s best-loved snack chip products for over 50 years, announced yesterday the addition of the one millionth ingredient in Doritos, the company' s flagship brand of cheese-flavored tortilla chips. The new ingredient, disodium guanylate, is expected not only to act as an additional emulsifying agent but also to make the big taste of Doritos even bigger. ' Today, we have reached a major milestone in the proud history of Doritos,'  Frito-Lay CEO Don Gehrmann said at a formal chip-breaking ceremony yesterday. ' One million ingredients!'  Following Gehrmann' s proclamation, amid wild applause, a Doritos scientist held up a three-foot-long dropper reading, ' Disodium Guanylate,'  and touched it to an oversized Doritos chip. According to experts, the new ingredient is a chemically produced emulsifier that will act as both a thickening agent and an anti-oxidant in Doritos, the nation' s top-selling cheese-flavored snack chip food product item. ' Disodium guanylate, or NaCl2O3G, should help slow the oxidation process in Doritos, serving as a valuable hydrolyzing reactor,'  MIT chemistry professor James Steuerbohm said. ' Essentially, it would play almost the exact same role that disodium inosinate plays in Funyuns.'  When informed of the landmark one millionth ingredient, President Clinton immediately sent his congratulations to the Frito-Lay Corporation. ' While clearly, Frito-Lay has gained much by adding this fine chemical compound to its impressive roster of ingredients, the real winner here is the American people,'  he said. ' They will enjoy an even more delicious, more mouth-watering snack chip than ever before.'  On the other side of the world, North Korean President Kim Jong Il briefly stepped away from a massive military demonstration in his honor yesterday to offer his congratulations. ' Doritos must be held in the absolute highest regard by the people. Denial of the greatness of such a snack chip must not be tolerated whatsoever,'  he said, later adding, ' Get a Life!'  Yesterday marked arguably the most important new ingredient addition to Doritos since May 1994, when ingredient number 966,450, FD&C Red 40 Lake, was added. ' The arrival of Red 40 Lake was a pivotal moment in Doritos history,'  noted food historian Joseph H. Farwell said. ' Before Red 40, Doritos had a slightly normal look; if you looked closely, you could tell there were a few naturally occurring ingredients in there. But after Red 40, the chips took on a blinding, explosive orange glow. Consumers responded immediately.'  Despite reaching the million-ingredient plateau yesterday, Gehrmann is already thinking about two million. ""That would be incredible,'  he said. ' There' s just so much out there we could still add: Par' tially Hydrol-yzed Protein Ex-tract, Malto' dex-trin, Tri-so-di-um Pho' -s-phate, cheese' the possibilities are endless.'  According to Doritos spokespeople, a target date of January 1, 2006, has already been set for reaching the two million ingredient plateau. To achieve this goal, beginning next week 274 new substances will be added to Doritos every day for the next 10 years. Though many question whether Doritos will be able to sustain such an exhausting ingredient-adding pace over a 10-year period, company officials remain confident. In fact, Doritos manufacturers are so confident, they are enthusiastically encouraging consumers to crunch all they want, as they have insured the American public they will make more.","food, economy, archive, news, vol 29 issue 18, the onion"
89,Death Star To Open Day Care Center,"After months of speculation, it was confirmed yesterday that the Death Star, the Empire' s vaunted, planet-destroying space station, has added a new, state-of-the-art day care center to its already vast array of capabilities. The massive four-room day care center, which, according to Grand Moff Tarkin, will ' provide a safe and fun learning environment for tots between the ages of one and four,'  has already begun spring enrollment and is expected to be fully operational by June 1. ' Nothing can stop the Sunshine Death Star Play and Learning Center,'  the Imperial Emperor said via holograph. ' With its four classrooms, outdoor playground and experienced staff of licensed day care professionals, no other facility can match its awesome instructive power.'  Though still several weeks away from full strength, the Sunshine Death Star Center is already up and running. Among the most popular activities there are finger-painting, storytime and Duck Duck Goose, which the Emperor often helps lead. ' Feel your hatred flow through you,'  he told 3-year-old Jenny Bates, as she energetically chased fellow toddler and ' goose'  Michael Phillips around the outside of the circle. ' Give in to your hatred!'  Disaster was narrowly averted last Friday, when the center took a field trip to the nearby planet Bespin. At the end of the day, minutes into the shuttle ride back to the Death Star, adult chaperone Darth Vader locked eyes with 4-year-old Matthew Schumpert. ' Wait,'  said Vader, probing deep into the child' s mind. ' There is another Schumpert.'  Vader sensed the presence of Katie Schumpert, Matthew' s sister, who was still back at the Bespin gift shop purchasing souvenirs. He ordered the shuttle to turn around and averted an embarrassing situation for the new day care facility. Vader later added: ' Join me, parents looking for a safe, dependable child care alternative, and together we will rule the galaxy.'  In addition to enjoying many fun games and learning activities, children at the Sunshine Death Star Day Care Center have already gotten to witness the destruction of several planets out the center' s giant bay window. Last Friday, in the middle of a coloring activity, the planet Alderan was blown up, delighting 23 of the 24 children who witnessed the devastating power of the battle station. The sole exception was Libby Phelps, 3, whose family was vacationing in Alderan at the time of its destruction. She was frightened by the loud explosion and began to cry upon realizing that her mother, father and younger sister were now dead. The emperor' s elite squadron of imperial guards leapt to action, removing the girl from the room and giving her some ice cream treats to calm her. According to Death Star officials, the idea for the center sprang up after a number of parents complained about the lack of quality, affordable child care options on the Death Star. ' As a stormtrooper and father of three, I' m very excited about the new day care center,'  Death Star citizen Ralph Sedgwick said. ' It' s a safe, nurturing environment, one in which my child will learn.'  Added Gail Lindon: ' For years I took my daughter to work because I couldn' t afford a nanny. Do you have any idea how hard it is to operate a tractor beam with a two-year-old pulling at your leg?'  As excited as most are about the new day care center, a few extremists have expressed concern about its proximity to the Death Star' s reactor core. ' There is an opening in the Death Star' s main shaft that leads to the core,'  parent and dissenting voice Annette Voss said. ' If a small rebel ship were to somehow break through the deflector shield and enter the shaft, it' s possible it could hit the reactor core with a single, well-placed proton torpedo shot and destroy the entire space station.'  Experts, however, scoff at Voss' s theory, dismissing such a shot as ' a million to one.' ","science & technology, kids, archive, news, vol 29 issue 18, the onion"

96,"Unabomber Condemned by Willie Tyler, Lester","WASHINGTON, D.C.' In an official ceremony held at the Justice Department Monday, ventriloquist Willie Tyler and his dummy, Lester, strongly condemned Una-bomber suspect Theodore Ka-czynski. The news media, Clinton administration officials, FBI agents and numerous family members of Unabomber victims were present to observe the somber public censure, which took place as part of a double header with former Phyllis Diller joke-writer Mel Habusch. In his first set, Tyler called the terrorist acts of the Unabomber ' cold, senseless acts of terror, which wrought tragedy upon the entire nation.'  Tyler then turned to Lester to ask his opinion. ' Lester,'  he said, ' Do you think the Unabomber is a cold, senseless killer?'  ' He is indeed,'  Lester said. ' He is a heartless monster.'  All in attendance were both touched by the ceremony and entertained by the amusing Lester, a diminutive, bespectacled replica of Tyler. The Unabomber is suspected of mailing or planting at least 20 bombs since the late 1970s, killing three people and causing millions of dollars in damage. His Luddite manifesto revealed a misanthropic loner who resorted to anonymous acts of terrorism to further his political agenda. Willie Tyler is a renowned ventriloquist who, with his dummy, Lester, has performed in venues nationwide, including the Stars Ballroom in Lake Tahoe and the Bahama Hotel in Atlantic City. He has also been a frequent guest on popular television programs such as The Merv Griffin Show, The Captain and Tenille Show, and Joe Franklin' s All Star Memories. In a touching memorial to the victims of the Unabomber, Tyler employed skillful ' rapid-fire'  delivery between a ventriloquist and his dummy to list the names of the victims. ' Mary Watkins,'  Tyler said. ' Mary Watkins?'  Lester responded incredulously. ' Judge Thomas Whallen,'  Tyler said. ' Judge Thomas Whallen?'  Lester dutifully repeated. ' Lester,'  Tyler said, breaking the rhythm momentarily. ' I' m trying to read the list of Unabomber victims.'  ' Oh, then go right ahead,'  Lester said. Lester then continued to quickly interrupt Tyler after each name, seemingly unhindered by Tyler' s polite request to stop the behavior. After a fast reading of the victims'  names, the audience applauded politely. ' I am pleased to add the voices of both Willie Tyler and Lester to the chorus of condemnation leveled at the Unabomber,'  President Clinton said in a statement from the White House. ' It is important that we as a society condemn the Unabomber' s horrific acts of terrorism,'  FBI director Bernard Whernan said. ' And it is vital that both Willie Tyler and Lester be among the leading voices of that condemnation.'  In his second set, Tyler wowed the audience by censuring the Unabomber while drinking a glass of water. As Tyler drank, Lester appeared to speak without difficulty, saying, ' These heartless acts of terror perpetrated upon America have put a permanent black mark on our history as a nation.'  Attorneys for Kaczynski reacted strongly to the condemnation. Said defense lawyer Albert Winnman: ' My client has already been tried and convicted by the American media establishment. He cannot get a fair trial. A public condemnation from Willie Tyler and Lester only makes things that much worse.'  Willie Tyler and Lester plan to take their condemnation of the Unabomber on the road. They will headline at Shecky' s Joke Barn in Omaha, NE, on Friday, May 10, and Saturday, May 11. And they will appear at The Wacky Works Comedy Showcase in Des Moines, IA, Thursday, May 16, through Sunday, May 19. The Unabomber trial date has not yet been set.","entertainment, archive, news, vol 29 issue 17, entertainment"

The creatures, many of whom have been with the zoo for over 30 years, have been released from their respective cages and pens, and are now free to roam the city in search of new homes, food sources and employment opportunities. ' The decision to lay off all these fine, hard-working animals, who have contributed so much to this zoo over the years, was an extremely difficult one,'  zoo CEO Jack T. Morgan announced at a shareholders'  meeting yesterday. ' We are fully confident, however, that this downsizing will help bring a leaner, healthier San Diego Zoo into the 21st century.'  According to zoo insiders, the released animals were let go largely due to decreasing productivity. ' Just look at a gorilla like KoKo, a 41-year-old lowland silverback,'  noted zoo industry insider Calvert DeCahill said. ' For the cost of feeding an old gorilla like him, the zoo could get about 15 young howler monkeys, each of whom can do the ass-scratching, swinging and screeching of at least five KoKos. That' s not cruel, that' s just smart business.'  Though released just yesterday, many of the animals have already run into problems with life on the outside. A rare Andalusian yellow-tailed ocelot, one of only 14 known to exist, was killed late last night on Chula Vista Boulevard when it mistook a speeding transit bus for a piece of fruit. At least 15 koalas have also died, foraging for eucalyptus leaves near electrified fences outside a the city' s major power plant. Some animals have created inconveniences for others. Kenny, a 950-pound Arctic polar bear, wandered into a downtown supermarket' s frozen foods aisle in search of frozen fish products. When a stock boy politely asked the bear to leave, the bear mauled him to death. ' The animals will no doubt have some trouble adjusting at first,'  said Morgan, who was brought in from a top Fortune 500 company last year to whip the zoo into financial shape by 1997. ' That' s only natural when you' re switching careers.'  Some experts are skeptical that every animal will ultimately succeed on the outside. ' Look at a Galapagos turtle like Shelley,'  said Beatrice Durning, a U.S. Labor De-partment official. ' She just laid 400 eggs last week. Where is she ever going to get enough fish, much less find time to go conduct a proper job search?'  Added biologist Harvey Chist: ' This is a problem that transcends species, class, order, genus, and even phylum.'  Others see more than simple economics in yesterday' s announcement. ' It' s interesting that all six elephants let go were of African descent,'  ob-served NAACP spokesperson Ben-jamin J. Watts. ' None of the Asians were fired. But that' s no surprise. They' ve been getting extra peanuts for years.'  To assist the laid-off animals, the San Diego Zoo has set up a Job Placement Center. Conveniently located near the Jungle World exhibit, the center features a bulletin board posting jobs openings at other zoos, in addition to circuses, nature preserves and traveling freak shows across the U.S. The job center also offers weekly training workshops to help animals build valuable interview, resume and cover letter-writing skills. ' We cannot keep these animals here anymore,'  San Diego Zoo vice president Stanley Brock said. ' But we are doing everything we pos-sibly can to help them get back on their feet' assuming they have feet. If they are snakes, or even seals, we will do everything in our power to get them on their proper ap-pen-da-ges.'  So far, no animals have signed up for the workshops. Employment experts and wildlife naturalists agree that in order to survive, the soon-to-be-unemployed animals must develop and diversify their skills. ' An Amazon parrot whose only skills are squawking loudly and breaking nuts with its beak has little to offer today' s big corporations,'  said Edmund Wills, a noted naturalist who frequently appears on PBS' s All Creatures Great and Small. ' It must acquire new ones, like learning to fly into stiff winds, how to kill Anaconda snakes, or how to operate popular spreadsheet programs like Quicken and Excel.'

98,Ronald Reagan Endorses 'Pill Lady' for president,"BEL AIR, CA' Former President Ronald Reagan, bedridden with Alzheimer' s Disease, surprised political observers Tuesday with his official endorsement in the 1996 presidential race. Making his first public statement in several months, Reagan said: ' Pill lady. I need Pill Lady.'  Bob Dole campaign manager Hal Greenberg reacted strongly to the endorsement. ' Bob Dole has a far better chance of winning the presidency in 1996 than does this Pill Lady,'  he said. Dole has not ruled out asking the Pill Lady to be his running mate. As the 2020 presidential race heats up, attention has turned to presidential polling and the wisdom of relying on an industry that generally predicted the wrong outcome in 2016.

99,Egyptian Archaeological Team Discovers 25-Year-Old Grave,"CAIRO' In a discovery that has electrified the global archaeological community, an Egyptian digging team unearthed a grave Sunday reported to be over 25 years old. The grave, found in a lot near downtown Cairo, is one of the rarest of its kind, and should offer new insight into the lives of people who lived as far back as 1970. ' The significance of this find is inestimable,'  said Oxford' s Gerald Tornquist, one of the world' s leading authorities on late 20th century life and culture. ' Our previous historical data is almost exclusively based on oral record, anecdotal evidence and detailed computer, video and written information. But to have something tangible from this era means we can now begin to understand it.'  The find comes on the heels of numerous false leads, including the discovery of tombs and burial chambers dating from 4,000 B.C.E.' an era already amply covered by past archaeological digs. While searching for gravesites from the latter half of the 20th century, archaeologists stumbled upon no fewer than eight older sites, many clogged with hard-to-dig-through solid gold, silver, rare jewels and gemstones. But yesterday, by digging upwards through the intact burial chamber of a third-century Egyptian high priestess, the team of archaeologists was able to uncover the grave, which, based on on-site carbon dating testing, is estimated at either 24 or 25 years old. ' It was tricky going at first, because there were several sharp diamond amulets and golden chalices that we had to blast through to get at the grave,'  archaeologist Massua Sa-dir said. ' But once we got through the first chamber, there it was in its glory' a pristine coffin untouched by grave robbers or erosion through-out the course of history.'  Though experts are still trying to piece the clues together, it is believed that the body belonged to a male held in high esteem in his society. Though no slaves were found buried with him, the remnants of a garment made up of three pieces with a strange neck adorn' ment re-main-ed intact on the body. Accor-ding to the limited amount of information that exists about the people of the mid-to-late 20th century, this was customary garb utilized either for special oc-casions or by people who were very important in their society. Diggers on site, after several painstaking hours of removing the sarcophagus from its earth-filled grave, also found a pair of ' shoes'  and, in near-perfect condition, a ' watch,'  or ' watch'  as it was called back then. These were im-me' di-ately ta-ken from the skeletal re-mains and brought to the lab at the Uni-versity of Cai-ro for further study. Also taken to the lab was the sarcophagus, a six foot by two and half foot box made of synthetic woods and metals. The metallurgy used in its construction appears to be highly advanced despite its estimated 35 years of age. Archaeologists remain hopeful that there are more bodies buried in the area, relying on ancient legend that people from this time period had mass grave ' yards'  where loved ones were buried all together. Until now, this notion had been dismissed as absurd.","science & technology, archive, archaeology, news, vol 29 issue 17, the onion"
100,Clinton Uses Power of Make-Believe to Turn Bar of Soap Into Tugboat,"WASHINGTON, D.C.' In an impressive act of imagination, President Clinton used the power of make-believe Sunday to turn an ordinary bar of soap into a fun, speedy tugboat. The soap-to-tugboat transformation, which occurred Sunday at 8:30 p.m. EST, or ' bathtime,'  is believed to be the first such metamorphosis by the President since October 11, 1995, when Clinton turned a shampoo bottle into a big whale. ' My fellow Americans,'  said Clinton, holding up a half-used bar of Ivory soap at a press conference yesterday afternoon, ' this may indeed look like a simple bar of facial soap. But last night, as I bathed in the White House bathtub, I successfully transformed it into a large tugboat and hauled its heavy cargo down the great Mississippi River.'  According to Clinton, the tugboat met many dangers en route to its destination. In addition to getting lost, and stopping at several incorrect ports, the boat encountered a serious storm and was violently tossed about by what the President described as ' heavy splashing.'  Clinton credited the cool head of the tugboat' s captain with keeping the vessel afloat in the storm. ' Without Captain Jim, that boat would have been lost,'  Clinton said. ' The crew expressed a desire to abandon ship, including the Captain' s ordinarily reliable first mate, Sailin'  Pete. But even during the worst moments of the storm, when all the crew members were shouting, ' Oh, no! Look out!'  and ' Let' s get out of here!'  Captain Jim steadfastly maintained, ' We' ve got to go on.'  He is to be commended and admired for his great courage.'  When asked what Captain Jim looks like, Clinton responded, ' I believe he has red hair and a big hat. In addition, he has a big, bushy beard and speaks in a gruff, seafaring voice.'  Shortly before 9 p.m., after nearly 30 minutes in the tub, Clinton transformed the tugboat back into a bar of soap, putting it back along the tub' s ledge and toweling himself off. ' It simply was time to get out of the tub,'  Clinton said. ' At that juncture, I had completed all my washing goals, and was satisfied with the amount of playtime I had had. With no bathing or bathing-related objectives remaining, I made the decision that the best thing to do would be to drain the tub and begin the drying process.'  Leading U.S. policy experts are not surprised Clinton chose to turn the soap into a tugboat. ' A tugboat is a natural choice for this type of pretend play,'  said Brent Scowcroft, former National Security Advisor under President Reagan. ' A boat is shaped somewhat like a piece of soap. And, like soap, a boat possesses the ability to float. And, finally, in a bathtub-type environment, there is naturally going to be water. So, to maximize both realism and imaginary possibilities, it' s best to turn the soap into something that would be in water.'  While White House officials would neither confirm nor deny them, rumors have circulated that Clinton initially turned the soap into a submarine but quickly decided that was ' impractical'  and ' ill-advised,'  as the submarine would not stay submerged. ' All we can say at this point is that when the President entered the bathtub, he considered several different play scenarios,'  White House secretary Helen Reynolds said. ' Whether at any time he pretended the soap was a top-secret Russian spy sub patrolling the North Atlantic, we can not say.'  Added Clinton: ' Regardless of what I did or did not do in that tub, I am confident that my experience has proven one thing' that bathtime can be extremely fun and that the power of the imagination is indeed great.'

101,"Perky ' Canada'  Has Own Government, Laws","It' s Monday morning, and Toronto resident Steve Dorman shares a quick breakfast of ' eggs'  (a native food) with his ' wife'  (an officially state-sanctioned mate), and discusses yesterday' s poor showing by the hometown team in ' baseball'  (a popular local sport). After a kiss on his wife' s cheek, he hops on the ' subway train'  (a mode of subterranean transport) to the office. This is life in exotic Canada City, the capital set deep in the heart of the mysterious land known as Canada (pronounced CAN-a-da). Like his estimated 35,000 fellow countrymen, Dorman is proud to be a ' Canadian.'  Located 120 miles north of Buffalo, NY, Canada is, according to Dorman, ' a nation with a government and laws distinct from those of the United States.'  It also has a military, a system of taxation, and periodic free elections to select political leaders. It even has its own currency, says Dorman, various denominations of ' dollars'  that can be exchanged for the many products manufactured in Canada, including Canadian bacon and ice. Canada City, Canada' s largest community, is located in a place called a ' province,'  a subdivision not unlike the cantons of Switzerland. There are 10 Canadian provinces in all, from Nova Scotia in the east to British Columbia in the west. And, much like America' s states, nearly every one of the provinces has its own capital. But make no mistake' there' s nothing provincial about these provinces. Canada has both feet planted firmly in the 20th century. ' In fact, Canadians enjoy advancements such as refrigerated food, zippers and printing,'  notes Dor-man, an ' accountant'  who goes to work wearing the comfortable trou-sers, dress shirt and necktie that form a traditional Canadian costume. ' Our industries are large and varied, ranging from logging to automobile manufacturing.'  Not too shabby for a nation that just 240 years ago had no electricity. One area in which Canada certainly has the U.S. beat is languages. Canadians speak not only English, but also French. In fact, according to Prime Minister (roughly Canada' s equivalent of a president) Jean ChrÃ©tien, ' French is the primary language in some parts of the country, and English is in others. The national language question has divided our nation terribly, with Quebec even recently threatening to leave the union.'  Canada has produced many prominent people who have gone on to great success in hockey. Among them is Colorado Avalanche goaltender Patrick Roy, who says hockey is the ' national sport'  of the Canadianers. ' It' s in our blood, it' s part of our heritage, and it brings people together,'  he says of the sport Canada picked up from America in the late ' 50s. So appreciative is Canada, it even has hockey teams called the ' Oilers'  and ' Jets,'  named after its favorite American football teams. Despite the language problem and other difficulties, at least one Canadianer is op-ti-mistic about his country' s pro-spects in the new millennium. ' Canada will remain free, proud and strong in the new century,'  says Dorman, heading off for another day of what in Ca-nada is known as ' work.'  ' Our nation will continue to be a beacon to those throughout the world who value liberty, dignity and human rights.'  Aww, isn' t that cute? At times like this, there' s really only one thing left to say: Oh, Canada!

102,I'm Never Taking the Bus Again,"Hola amigos. What' s goin'  on at your end? It' s been a long time since I' ve rapped at ya' , but I' ve been busier than a horny dog at a leg convention. See, I' ve been working at Sandy' s, a place way on the other side of town. They serve burgers and steaks and sandwiches. I try not to work Fridays, ' cause that' s fish fry night, and nothing' s worse than trying to wash fish fry grease off of plates. Then, the customers get their greasy hands all over their glasses, and I have to wash greasy glasses. All that means I gotta change the water every 15 minutes instead of twice a night. I figured out that the best way to get out of it was to tell my boss that I had a church group meeting that night. (She isn' t named Sandy. I only seen her once, and she ragged on me for having long hair. I shoulda walked right there, but I didn' t want to give her the satisfaction.) Man, they bought that' hook, line and sinker! When they ask me how it went, I tell them all fine and talk about stuff like how I shouldn' t steal and chase whores and stuff. I look all holy on the outside, but inside I' m bustin'  a gut laughing. What a bunch of saps! Anyway, I hate busting suds, but at least I get free food, and the cook does the fries just how I like ' em. The biggest problem with it is the location. Now, ordinarily, I wouldn' t give a rat' s ass about where it was if I had functional wheels, but I burned out my clutch on the way to see Unmasked, a Kiss tribute band that plays in full make-up and even breathes fire. That sucked big time. Not only did I lose my precious wheels, but I also missed out on my chance to see all those hot chicks that pop up at Unmasked gigs. I don' t know if you can tell by my picture, but a lot of people tell me I look like Vinnie Vincent. I would have gotten some tail for sure! So I got no car, but I still have a job that' s about three miles away. I sure as hell ain' t walking that, hombres. Jim Anchow-er never walks! So what are my choices? While I hate being a dish dog, I need to get my automobile back to its original status. That all adds up to one thing: the bus, and no one ever got laid by taking the bus. First time I take the bus since I got my license, I had to wait 20 minutes in the cold before it actually shows up. When it finally showed up, I made for the far back seat, as far from the driver as I can so he can' t scope on me. No one else was sitting around me, just five other people sitting in the middle minding their own business. That' s just how I like it, too. Things are going just fine for the first mile and then we stop to let on a bunch of kids. They all come back like they' re the shit and sit by me. They' re all talking trash about how drunk they got and which ladies they' re going for, but I' m not paying attention to them ' cause they' re just a bunch of kids. Live and let live, that' s my motto. Apparently, they don' t share my enlightened philosophy, ' cause one of ' em tries to bum smokes off of me. ' Sorry, man,'  I say to him. Maybe I had some, and maybe I didn' t, but I wasn' t letting these punks get the better of me, so I played it off all mysterious. Then one of ' em says, ' What' s with the hat, dude? It' s, like, too warm for that.'  I tell ' em that they' d do best to mind their own business if they didn' t want to step over the line. They sit all quiet for a second, then one of ' em grabs it off of my head and throws it to his friends. ' That,'  I say all quiet and smooth, ' was not smart.'  I grab the kid that took my hat to give him the business, and one of his friends comes up and pulls up on my underwear band. Man, I practically invented the undie grundy, so when one of these little dickweeds did it to me, I went ballistic. I turned around and grabbed him, and I was just about ready to make his nose flat when the bus driver stops and yells at me to quit picking on the kids. I try to tell him that they took my hat, but he ain' t hearing any of it. The kids are laughing their asses off, which just makes me more mad. I grab my hat back and mouth the word ' later'  at those punks. I swear, the looks on their faces was priceless. They had the fear of Jim put in them plain and simple. Just then, I looked out the window and saw that the bus had just blown past my stop. I got all mad and hollered for the driver to stop. He slams on the brakes and gives me a look like I' m troubling him to do his damn job. I give him a look back and storm off the bus. Man, bus drivers are just cops without badges and guns and fast cars and sirens. They suck! I look back to the bus and the kids were looking at me all funny like they were expecting my head to pop off. I let them know just what I thought of them by giving them the bird. Just as the bus started pulling away, I put on my hat and they all bust out laughing all of a sudden. Sure enough, they had loogied in my hat. I was so pissed that I could hardly talk. Plus I was late to work and I got a demerit point. I tell ya, the moment I get my car back in working order, I' m going to find that bus and drive real slow in front of it so the driver gets all pissed off. Then, when I know those kids are riding it, I' m going to follow it until they get off, and I' m going to whale the shit out of them until they apologize for doing that to my favorite hat. Take it from me, amigos, you' d do best to stay away from the bus. Unless it' s the magic bus like the Who sang about in their song ' Magic Bus,'  which, when you think about it, is probably about weed. Maybe I' ll ride that bus, my friends, but I' m never riding the normal bus again, and you' ve got the Anchower guarantee on that one.

Dear Navy SEAL, I am a happily married man with a warm and loving wife who is also one of my best friends. We' ve been together for 17 years (married for 15) and couldn' t be happier, but lately she says she wants separate beds. I' m reeling!

112,Deforestation Complete,"Global deforestation, the environmental disaster forewarned by eco-radicals since as far back as 1980, has finally and irreversibly arrived, spokespersons from Worldwide PulpCo announced Monday. The final tree, a 120-foot-tall Russian fir located near the timber line in a remote region of northwest Siberia, was cut down by PulpCo and converted into 10,000 sanitary straw wrappers for a major national fast-food chain. With the elimination of trees, the earth' s leading producer of oxygen, biologists believe all oxygen-dependent animal and plant species will soon become extinct. ' This is somewhat of a setback,'  PulpCo CEO Douglas Langley said. ' But we want to assure our customers that we will continue our commitment to producing top-quality consumer paper products.'  Ecologists predict that by late June, the planet will be littered with the unburied corpses of most, if not all, of the earth' s fauna. Despite the impending apocalypse, accountants for PulpCo assured shareholders in an emergency meeting that the company' s earnings would continue to grow. ' Last quarter, earnings reached one of the highest levels in our company' s history, and there is no reason to expect our profitability to drop, though we may need to step up our marketing efforts for resume-quality cotton bond paper.'  Environmental groups such as Earth First, Save the Rain-forest and Greenpeace were despondent over the news. ' No one listened to such experts as Sting, Christopher Reeve and Whoopi Goldberg when they predicted that at the current rate, the earth would be deforested by the year 2000,'  said Renee Jau-bert, co-founder of Greenpeace. ' Well, as usual, some of Hollywood' s biggest stars were right.'  Jaubert added that with the environment now destroyed, Green-peace will focus on the alarming worldwide depletion of hats. Even more important than environmental concerns, the deforestation has raised the issue of finding new paper sources. According to the Senate Joint Council on Paper Sources, paper company scientists are already developing a new, improved paper source by converting oil and coal into napkins and paper towels. ' We have also found that when certain sea creatures are burned and spun through a high-speed centrifuge,'  scientist James DeVries said, ' it creates an organic pulp-like substance that closely resembles paper.'  One negative side effect of this process, according to DeVries, is that it takes an estimated 500 whales to make just one sheet of 8 1/2"" by 11"" paper. At that rate, whales, as well as many other aquatic species, could face extinction by year' s end. ' We' ll cross that bridge when we come to it,'  responded Harrison Graves, president and CEO of United Paper, when asked if he was aware of the potential ramifications of whale-based paper products. Graves, like many of his fellow CEOs who sit on the Senate Joint Council, did express disappointment that they will no longer have traditional firewood for the fireplaces at their Aspen ski chalets, and that they will no longer be able to enjoy steaks and other foods after the extinction of all carbon-based life from the earth. Said U.S. Rep. Carl Berkin (R' AR), ' The U.S. is committed to being a world leader in producing paper, and no lack of trees or end to life on this planet is going to stop us. Remember, the U.S. is number one. Number one, baby.' ","environment, archive, news, vol 29 issue 16, the onion"
113,"Dog People, Cat People","An Onion Play In Two Acts CAST STEVE, a lean, handsome man in his early 30s who works as a loan officer. MELANIE, a petite, cute woman in her late 20s who works as a bank teller. PETER, the president of Consolidated Bank, a tall, silver-haired man in his mid-50s. ACT ONE An employee party in PETER' s luxurious penthouse. STEVE, who has had a few drinks but who is still quite sober, approaches MELANIE, who is sitting at the end of a couch. STEVE: Is something wrong? MELANIE: (a bit startled) Oh, no. I' m just trying to think of the last time I fed my cat. I think I forgot his dinner. He gets upset when his schedule is disrupted. STEVE: What do you see in cats? I just don' t un-der-stand how people can get along with them. MELANIE: I suppose you' re a dog person. STEVE: (nodding proudly) Why, yes I am. MELANIE: I think cats are better pets than dogs. STEVE: No way. Dogs are better. MELANIE: (shaking her head and smiling con-fi-dent-ly) But dogs are so dumb! You go out for a second to get the mail and when you come back they act like they haven' t seen you in a week! STEVE: (crumples his face skeptically) Come on! Cats never pay attention to you! Dogs are af-fec-tion-ate. When you come home from a long day at work, they' re so excited to see you! MELANIE: Oh, yeah? Well at least cats groom themselves. A dog won' t ever clean itself. STEVE: I' d rather own a pet that gets dirty once in a while than a pet that has to relieve itself in a box! MELANIE: So I suppose you enjoy taking your dog (groans) outside a million times a day. STEVE: Well how about the fact that cats have to be pampered? They' re so fussy! MELANIE: Cats simply have finer, more sophisticated tastes' like their owners. (smiles and folds her arms triumphantly) STEVE: Cat owners are icy and detached. MELANIE: Dog owners are messy and simple-mind-ed! ACT TWO PETER approaches their couch, attracted by MELANIE' s outburst. PETER: (holding out his hands as if surrendering) Whoa, you two! Calm down! Sparring over the superiority of the dog and the cat has been a staple of conversational small talk for as long as polite society has existed. The playful debate which springs from our love for our two favorite' but very different' companion animals always results in a delightful exchange. But the argument will never be settled. Actually, that' s part of its enduring appeal. STEVE: (slowly looks from PETER to MELANIE) I' m sorry for snapping at you. Hey, maybe we should mingle. We can' t let this party (pauses and smiles devilishly) go to the dogs! MELANIE: (taking his hand and nodding) You' re right. That would be a cat-tastrophe! STEVE and MELANIE rise from the couch hand in hand and walk off to rejoin the party. CURTAIN","archive, archive, vol 29 issue 16, the onion"
114,Uptight Matron Enjoys Handful of Pills,"SCOTSDALE, AZ' Georgette McHue, a Scotsdale-area uptight matron, enjoyed a handful of colorful pills yesterday, swallowing them down after dinner with a glass of water. The estimated 39 gel-capped pills, an assortment of doctor-prescribed medications designed to fortify her diet and calm a recently diagnosed nervous condition, were described by McHue as ' very important'  to her continued good health. ' I feel more spring in my step than when I was in my 20s,'  she said. She is slated to take the same dosage every day at dinner time until prescribed otherwise. ' The blue one is for calcium, the orange one is for fiber, the pink one is estrogen, the big yellow one is for shingles, and the white ones help me sleep better,'  McHue explained.","local, health, archive, news in brief, vol 29 issue 16, local"

121,Clinton Seduced by Suave International Diamond Thief,"President Clinton, in a surprise announcement from the White House Monday, told reporters that he had been ro-man-ced and ultimately burgled by Sir Neville St. James de Mont-Blanc, a notorious international diamond thief and ladies man. ' My fellow Americans, I stand before you today to tell you that I have been seduced,'  Clinton said of the suave thief, better known to countless beautiful women around the world as The Ermine Fox. ' Sir Neville St. James de MontBlanc, with his devastating good looks and irresistible charm, has stolen my heart. And despite the best efforts of myself and a number of State Department officials, he has refused to give it back.'  Clinton explained that the infamous gem thief, whom he had met at an embassy dinner, deceived him, seducing the president for the sole purpose of stealing millions of dollars in White House treasures. ' He disappeared almost immediately after we made love,'  a visibly shaken Clinton said. ' I asked Mr. MontBlanc if he would stay, and he said he would forever, but in the morning he was gone.'  Clinton added that in addition to robbing the White House of its prized Van Buren Presidential Jewels, priceless heirlooms of inestimable value, the Ermine Fox also robbed him of, as he put it, ' something far more precious' my innocence.'  The Ermine Fox, who apparently wined and dined Clinton for weeks prior to the burglary, regaling him with tales of service in the Foreign Legion and of adventures with the Viceroy of India during the colonial heyday, was able to seduce Clinton with a series of highly effective techniques derived from years of exhaustive research, sources said. By gazing at the President from underneath slightly lowered lashes, twirling his pencil-moustache in a manner Clinton described as ' mysterious,'  and by plying the bewitched President with exotic gifts from around the world, the rascally jewel thief was quickly able to gain the President' s trust, placing him under a spell of romance. ' As I have already told Secretary of State Warren Christopher and several top Cabinet members at a closed-door session this morning, I fully believed he loved me,'  the President said. Shortly after lulling the swooning Clinton into a false sense of security with champagne, perfumes and flowers, de MontBlanc delivered the coup-de-grace' presenting the President with a gift of a designer original off-the-shoulder strapless silk evening gown and a gigantic diamond brooch (later discovered to be false), and asking the tear-struck commander-in-chief for his hand in marriage. Later, however, he stole into the Presidential bedchambers, eluding the dogs and security personnel with an elaborate series of electronic noise-baffler generators, and left the White House safe empty' along with a note and a rose on Clinton' s pillow. The Fox, described by FBI sources as a continental, sophisticated David Niven type with an irresistibly captivating charm and a devilish lust for diamonds and precious gems, has evaded the efforts of Interpol to track him down for more than 30 years. Investigators say their efforts at capture have been frustrated not only by the agile, cat-like ability of the Fox to steal away across rooftops with the aid of special grappling hooks, pulleys and sophisticated rope gadgets, but also by his chameleon-like mastery of all manner of disguise. His most famous caper, say sources, was the disappearance of the notorious Green Lady gem, with which he escaped after seducing the aging Lady Beauvior-Schleim of Austria, heiress to the Kleigburg Winepress fortune. ' A number of my top senior advisors urged me not to rush into things, to let things develop slowly. I was unable to resist, however, so beguiling was the charm,'  Clinton told reporters, holding the exquisitely calligraphied letter under his nose and sniffing at its perfumed envelope. ' The wedding, needless to say, will not take place.'  ' The list of The Ermine Fox' s lovers and victims reads like a veritable Who' s Who of international jet-set high society,'  said Scotland Yard Inspector Edwin Wilingsbirth, head of the blue-ribbon team of international law enforcement personnel assigned to track down the elusive Fox. ' However, I believe this is the first time a United States President has fallen under his sly spell, save for a brief fling with Gerald Ford in Geneva in 1975.'  He then interrupted the interview to answer a special flashing briefcase phone near his desk, before terminating reporters'  questions, saying, ' No time to chat, lads! The game' s afoot! I' m off to exotic Morocco!' ","archive, news, vol 29 issue 15, the onion"
122,Area Students Prepare Breasts For Increased Springtime Display,"Female college students from across the northern U.S. celebrated the improved weather this week, preparing their breasts for the increased exposure and display that the warm weather now demands. For the last several months, the students'  breasts have existed only in the imaginations and fond memories of others, obscured by baggy sweaters, bulky ski jackets, and shapeless flannel. Yet, with the coming of spring, all that has changed, as students now slip into less fabric and fewer layers. Their breasts, like big cuddly honeybears wiping the sleep from their eyes as they emerge from hibernation, once again climb out into the sunshine, stretch out in the open air, and with near-mythic power grab the attention of all around, their taut nipples and gently undulating femme-flesh seeming almost to smile and say: ' Look at us! Look at us!'  ' I just bought a new spring ' mini-T'  from Urban Outfitters,'  University of Michigan sophomore Debi Kahn, 19, says. ' Its snug, almost too-small fit captures the essence of my girlhood, and at the same time allows me to prominently display my womanhood. It also has a Charlie' s Angels logo on it in 1970s-style iron-on glitter-puff.'  Kahn' s classmates who have seen the shirt confirmed that it was ' so way fly,'  and added they are eagerly looking forward to seeing her breasts protrude exuberantly from within it. ' At schools in warmer climates, the vast quantities of breasts tend to take on a diminished significance, because of overexposure,'  says Professor Hiram Milchan of the Hebraic Studies department of the Greater Miami Divinity School. ' The campus populace tends to become jaded toward breasts, as they are nearly always visible even to a casual onlooker.'  Pointing out his office window at an impromptu dormyard game of bikini volleyball, Milchan adds, ' This does not move me. The undulating, the bouncing, the firm upraised globes leaping skyward, then back down again with a resounding bounce' all of this has become commonplace here in Florida.'  Milchan went on to explain that in northern climes, the ebb and flow of the seasons creates a corresponding ebb and flow of breast visibility. At the University of Wisconsin and other northern universities possessing lengthy winters and a left-leaning, socially liberal student body, the recent preponderance of breast displays has brought student traffic to near-gridlock, with heterosexual males and both closeted and out lesbians gawking at the near-unbelievable levels of mammarian visibility. Although most agree that the natural power of the female breast needs no improvement, some women are using technology to further their breast goals. Northwestern University sophomore Heather Bain, a self-described B-cup with aspirations toward the C range, plans to covertly employ a ' Miracle Bra,'  a new, highly technical device that utilizes cutting-edge ' padding technology'  to make the breasts appear a full cup size larger. The ' Wonder Bra,'  a similar device, uses equally high-tech wire to compress the breasts forcibly, producing greatly increased ' cleavage.'  Experts are not surprised by the students'  breast enhancement efforts, as spring frequently brings about a heightened air of sexual tension. ' From ancient Mesopotamian societies all the way to today' s college campus settings, young people have frequently paid increased attention to sexual matters with the onset of warm weather,'  University of Minnesota sociology professor Jane Simonson says. ' I myself, though no spring chicken, have initiated numerous illicit affairs with strapping young students of mine, both male and female, though I am well past my prime breeding years.'  Lesbian student organizations agreed. ' Although we are deeply opposed to the systematic sexual objectification of women and their breasts by male heterodoxy, we lesbians are in a uniquely two-fold position of strength in these wondrous springtime months, enjoying both the opportunity to display our fantastic breasts to others, and the chance to enjoy an eyeful of the breasts of our fellow sisters,'  says Meghan Thomas of Lesbian Students for Social Change. Spotting a lithe, tube-topped, female rollerblader speeding along nearby, she bit her knuckles, adding, ' Wow!' ","college, archive, news, vol 29 issue 15, the onion"

An array of Italian police, Interpol agents, and the Pope' s personal bodyguards have not been able to locate the keys, a set of gold-inlaid relics which date back to the 4th century A.D. ' I thought I had them in my robes when I left the bishop' s house last night,'  the Pope said. ' But I might have left them on top of the VCR.'

129,Umabomber Captured,"FBI Ends 18-Year Search for Leggy Luddite Lolita In a spectacular climax to the longest manhunt ever mounted by the FBI, federal agents captured the notorious, glamorous Umabomber yesterday. The radical terrorist and darling of the silver screen is the chief suspect in 16 bombings, 23 injuries and three deaths, as well as audience-wowing appearances in the racy Dangerous Liaisons and the smash hit Pulp Fiction, over the last 18 years. FBI investigators spent a reported $68 million and over 300,000 work hours in their effort to nab the elusive beauty, and as the starlet flashed her million-dollar smile at paparazzi while being led into custody last week, one question arose: Who can blame them? The star-studded arrest was witnessed by over two million viewers on Pay-Per-View and featured law enforcement officials from seven states as well as celebrity guests Brad Pitt and Bruce Willis. ' The Umabomber' s been on the FBI' s Ten Most Wanted List for 18 years,'  Variety columnist Bunny Shirer said, ' and on People magazine' s 50 Most Beautiful People in the World list for the last five. That means two things: Boffo Box Office, and Blammo Post Office.'  She later added that MCA/ Universal had been pursuing the Umabomber for years, and that the FBI is very lucky to have her. ' The Umabomber is a ruthless, highly educated extremist with no respect for human life, and whose looks and talent have made her an extremely sought-after property, both in Hollywood and by national law enforcement,'  said the Umabomber' s Pulp Fiction co-star Bruce Willis at an exclusive after-arrest party at L.A.' s Viper Room. The Umabomber, who has lived a life of luxury for years, shielded from media scrutiny by security cameras and bodyguards, was almost impossible to reach, according to FBI spokespersons. ' We must have called her publicist six, seven times a week,'  said Tom Bannon of the joint Federal Bureau of Investigation/Screen Actors'  Guild team in charge of tracking the elusive Umabomber throughout her grisly and glamorous career. ' Always, it was the same thing: ' Uma' s not available this week, we' ll get back to you.' '  Police left messages on her voice mail, staked out her manager' s office, and sent her scripts, all to no avail. ' We' re very excited to finally get the Umabomber for the FBI,'  said an FBI official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ' Now that we' ve stolen her away from her three-picture deal at Paramount, we can expect higher FBI box-office grosses than ever before.'  After a number of false leads (such as a rumor that 1992' s Final Analysis would be shot on location in Tunisia, causing an expensive and fruitless mobilization of Interpol), FBI detectives got their first real break a year later, when the Umabomber' s bodyguard, Flavio, allegedly punched an FBI photographer who was trying to get inside her limousine. The Umabomber remained strangely inactive following her starring role in the flop Even Cowgirls Get the Blues, prompting hopeful speculation that her deadly spree may have permanently ended. She returned to the spotlight last year however, with the horrific letter-bombing of timber lobbyist Murray Bilgert, and numerous supporting roles that showed her increasing versatility as an actress. Experts agree that the Umabomber' s fatal slip-up occurred in 1995, when the star' s publicist convinced the New York Times and Washington Post to print a 35,000-word manifesto against technology alongside a full-page ad for her Oscar-nominated release, Pulp Fiction. But it was the media campaign for the upcoming release of the irreverent romantic comedy The Truth About Cats and Dogs, co-starring funnywoman Janeane Garofalo, that made the Umabomber' s cap-ture all the more urgent, ac-cor-ding to sources close to the case. ' If that film is a hit, you can erase any doubts about the Umabomber' s staying power as a celebrity,'  said FBI spokesman Tom Haver. According to The Uma-bomb-er' s personal assistant, Denise Mazur, despite persistent rumors that she is involved with Johnny Depp, she is single and looking forward to prison life. ' After all that terrorist bombing and 19-hour days on the set,'  Mazur says, ' the Umabomber is looking forward to being a regular prisoner again.'

130,Spring is a Great Time for Sex,"A Seasonal Message From The Onion One of the longest winters on record has drawn to a close. As the snow melts away and warm breezes begin blowing through the new season, the American people will begin the slow process of healing themselves from the psychological and spiritual ravages of the coldest and hardest months. In or-der for this heal-ing process to be carried out as quickly as pos-sible, The Onion appeals to the citizenry to do their duty by taking a good, long, deep breath; rolling up their sleeves; and getting to work on their fucking. For nearly half a year we have been cooped up inside, usually with the same few people, rebreathing the same stale air and wearing too many bulky clothes. The slow hands of despair have crushed our hearts in a deathgrip of windchill and the soul' killing reek of unwashed scarves. Now, spring is here, bringing with it the most fuck-conducive weather there is. When the air is narcotically fresh and warm but the ground is lousy with mud and thawing dog crap, it' s time to go back inside, throw those windows open, tear those stifling dusty blankets off the bed, and commence fucking! You' ll be glad you did. Everyone knows that, for pure fun, you can' t beat the simple good times to be had while fucking. There are few thoughts the human mind enjoys thinking as much as, ' Hey! It' s spring and I' m fucking!'  Awkward differences between individuals disappear when those people take to fucking, and suddenly little things like divergent musical tastes, conflicting political philosophies or incompatible peer groups don' t seem to matter a tinker' s damn. What matters is the jolly fucking and the fact that the snow has gone away. Life can be reduced to its essentials and a sense of perspective can be regained, all thanks to the power of fucking. In our national struggle to end the winter doldrums, we must not ignore the fact that the power of fucking and the healing power of spring are actually one and the same. Chaucer, Thoreau, and Winston Churchill each praised the power of spring in his own time, but their praise is really meant to celebrate the transcendent power of fucking in a world magically changed by the seasons. All of nature feels the call of spring whispered softly in the ears of beast and bird alike: ' Spring is here'  let' s fuck!'  For much of nature, this is a method of replacing members of the species lost over the long winter. Fortunately, our species has recently advanced to the point where we are no longer required to use fucking for purely reproductive purposes. Properly executed, fucking is a celebration of life akin to spring itself. We are truly fortunate to be able to include fucking in the bag of tricks which makes us human. Please, take the afternoon off, take out those storm windows, take off your clothes, and fuck! None of this smarmy ' lovemaking,'  please, and none of that brutish ' porking,'  either. Just good old athletic fucking, thank you very much! Now, get fucking, citizens, and put an end to this spiritual malaise that threatens to end our very way of life.","opinion, sex, archive, news, vol 29 issue 14, the onion"
131,Middle Management Prepares for 'Operation Xerox-Fax',"HARTFORD, CT' Middle management officials at Coopers & Schmidt, a Hartford-based insurance claims adjustment firm, are busy gearing up this week for Operation Xerox-Fax, a covert, high-stakes faxing mission scheduled for April 23. The goal of the risky operation, which will involve an estimated three mid-level employees, ranging from assistant account coordinators to re-gional sales supervisors, is the successful photocopying, faxing and confirmation of Coopers & Schmidt' s March ' 96 benefits summary. ' This is an exciting, high-risk mission,'  said Tom Gerosa, an associate claims adjuster who has been with the firm for 14 years. ' I pray no one is hurt.'  Operation Xerox-Fax is set to begin at 10 a.m. sharp, when Coopers & Schmidt secretary Janice D' Alessio will make a photocopy of the benefits summary, which she will then put in company vice-president Ralph Gleick' s mailbox. When her portion of the mission is complete, D' Alessio will remove the original document from the Xerox machine, walk across the office, and hand-deliver it to regional benefits co-supervisor Art Blaine, who will be awaiting the document in his cubicle. Blaine is considered by many to be the pointman of the Operation. Responsible for double-checking the benefits summary against the benefits file on his computer, he must then transport it safely to new accounts manager Terri Auletta at the fax machine, which lies more than 30 yards from Blaine' s cubicle, past the supply closet, paper shredder and inspirational corporate poster that reads: ' Success' If You Believe It, You Can Achieve It.'  ' There will be dangers, no doubt,'  said Blaine, who was promoted from assistant benefits supervisor to co-supervisor six years ago when Ted Stram died. ' The area of the office I will cross is one of our most volatile' sales managers demonstrating golf swings, outgoing Federal Express packages lying on the floor, the list goes on. My wife is very concerned, but she knows this is what comes along with the job. She knew it wouldn' t be easy when she married me. She' s strong though.'  Making matters more tense is the fact that the fax can only take place between 10:45 and 11:30 a.m. If the fax doesn' t get sent during that window, then the recipient, regional assistant sales and benefits manager Gary Tre-mont, will in all likelihood be at lunch, meaning the fax cannot get sent and have receipt confirmed until after the lunch hour, which could be as late as 2 p.m. ' I don' t even want to talk about that possibility,'  Au-letta said. ' Fail-ure is not an option with this team.'  Operation coordinator Paul McHue is confident his elite squad of middle management employees is fully prepared for its mission. ' We have trained day and night for months for this Operation,'  McHue said. ' The photocopy machine' s ink cartridge has been checked and re-checked. Missing staplers have either been returned or replaced. Paper clips have been positioned at strategic points along the mission route. Fax numbers have been confirmed. Hallways have been cleared of all empty boxes. Clearance has been received from office manager Nancy Lu-ber-da. We only get one shot at this.'  Despite all the preparations, disaster almost struck Thursday when, during a rou-tine test run, the Xerox ma-chine un-expect-edly ran out of paper. ' We were out of letter-size, and had no choice but to go with bright pink legal-size pa-per,'  Auletta said. ' Had that happened during the real thing, all would have been lost.'  The man responsible for the empty paper tray, assistant claims adjuster George Haselbreit, has since been replaced. ' George was always too much of a risk,'  McHue said. ' His style was too flashy; he was too much of a hot dog, a loose cannon. We had no choice but to replace him with someone who can stick to a mission directive' Pat Cook from third-floor client services.'  Operation Xerox-Fax, which was approved last Thursday in a hand-signed memo from Lu-ber-da, is the boldest fax-related maneuver undertaken at Coopers & Schmidt in nearly four years. In November 1992, a renegade team of seventh-floor actuaries and accountants faxed client Jim Reinhardt, a Hartford physician, a four-page spreadsheet analysis of his projected taxable earnings from holdings and investments for fiscal year 1993. ' Three of us went into the office that day,'  recalled accountant William Keating, who was part of Operation Fax Spreadsheet Data to Jim Rein-hardt. ' And only two came out.'

132,Cholera Outbreak Makes Americans Glad They Don' t Live in Africa,"Lagos' The major cholera outbreak that has ravaged the Nigerian city of Lagos and surrounding rural villages has many Americans feeling very glad they do not live in Africa. ' I am glad I live in Erie, PA, and not in Lagos or one of its surrounding villages,'  American Carl Neesbrum said. Neesbrum, reflecting the view of many Americans, said he is also very glad he and his three children are not victims of cholera, a water-borne bacteria that inflicts explosive diarrhea, paralyzation and, ultimately, death on its victims. When told that Africans are dying by the hundreds each day and that simple, anti-bacteria vaccinations for the outbreak are unaffordable to the impoverished victims there, Neesbrun added, ' I think I will go to Best Buy today and purchase a program for my CD-ROM.'  WASHINGTON' With its vote to adopt a resolution denouncing the freshman' s congresswoman behavior, the House of Representatives formally censured Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Friday for employing the sexist slur ' fucking bitch'  in a speech on the House floor the day prior. ' The representative from New York' s 14th District is hereby condemned for her unapologetic enunciation of these hateful, abusive words, which not only brought disgrace to this esteemed body but were incredibly demeaning to all womankind,'  House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said as he read aloud the official rebuke, adding that as a woman herself, Ocasio-Cortez should have known better than to speak aloud the unconscionable term, let alone read it into the Congressional Record. ' Her appalling speech of July 23 does not reflect the values of the United States Congress, nor does it reflect the example we wish to set for our children' especially our daughters. While this body will not ask what prompted her to adopt such unprofessional language, it will require the representative to issue an immediate apology to her colleagues or face further disciplinary action for her misconduct.'  In his own words, McCarthy went on to observe that it was too soon to tell just how far back Ocasio-Cortez had set ' young ladies'  in Congress with her ' hysterical'  outburst.","world, health, archive, news in brief, vol 29 issue 14, the onion"

134,Hero Fireman Saves Child Trapped in Bob Dole,"PLAINFIELD, NE' In an inspiring display of modern-day heroism, Plainfield fireman James Pagnozzi yesterday saved the life of area resident Janie Siles, 4, who became caught in Republican presidential front-runner Bob Dole while exploring an abandoned barn. Siles, who was nearly crushed to death by the candidate' s case-hardened internal gears and high-speed threshing blades, is recovering at a nearby hospital. Dole, who was breaking in a new John Deere turbodiesel engine between stumping spots at the time, said he was unaware of the child playing nearby and denied responsibility for the accident. ' Bob Dole is clearly marked with warning stickers stating ' Do Not Play On Or Around Bob Dole,' '  he said. ' Bob Dole is not a toy. Bob Dole is the latest in modern self-supporting combine harvesters. Bob Dole will be the next President of the United States.'  It is believed to be the worst Dole-related accident since the Kansas senator was converted from steam propulsion after a boiler explosion killed two migrant workers in August 1916. According to police, Siles was attracted by the shiny, moving shapes within Dole' s open hip panel and, reaching in, became engulfed in the candidate' s machinery. Fortunately for Siles, the nearby Pagnozzi heard her screams and was able to pry open Dole using a ' Jaws of Life' -style hydraulic device. ' I' m no hero,'  Pagnozzi stated modestly while recuperating. ' I was just doing my job. But mark my words, those Bob Dole things are extremely unsafe. There aren' t any safety interlocks on his access panels or grain feed channels to prevent this kind of thing. If people keep heavy agricultural machinery such as Bob Dole running unattended, this sort of thing will keep happening.'  Dole, mistakenly left unattended with his side-access panel un-locked, expressed regret at the accident and gratitude toward Pagnozzi for saving the child' s life. ' Bob Dole sees safety as a big concern for Bob Dole,'  Dole said. ' Bob Dole is saddened by this little girl' s trauma, and Bob Dole thanks the Plainfield Fire Department for its quick intervention. Bob Dole will lead this country into the 21st century.'  An internal investigation is underway to determine the reason Dole was left unattended at a crucial point in his seasonal maintenance cycle, a time when he is normally surrounded by a security team. ' Bob Dole is not dangerous when properly handled by trained agro-technical personnel,'  the candidate said, ' Bob Dole will be the next president of the United States!'  Siles, now listed in stable condition, lost three fingers as a result of the accident. Emergency personnel searched valiantly for her severed digits so they could be surgically reattached, but after several hours the search was aban-doned. Ex-perts a-greed that the missing fingers must have already been sheared off, crushed in Dole' s grain hull/separator, and disposed of like chaff by being passed through his wastegate. ' Bob Dole cannot be blamed for tur-ning the Siles girl' s digits into processed silage,'  Dole said. ' Conversion of organic substances into food products for consumption by humans or livestock are automatic procedures within Bob Dole over which Bob Dole' s directional programming has no control. Bob Dole makes no apologies.'  Siles refused to speak to reporters about the candidate, responding to their questions with cries of, ' Tractor bad! Tractor hurt Janie! No more tractor man!'  That sort of reaction, Dole campaign staffers say, is typical in small children when ex-posed to Dole' s internal me-chanics. ' Janie will in all likelihood be plagued by nightmare-like flash-backs for years to come,'  Dole spokes-person Ri-ta Loew said. ' We are confident, though, that as the wound-trauma sub-sides, the child will eventually lose its fear of Dole and learn to accept the device as its new leader.'  ' Bob Dole is not scary,'  Dole stressed. ' Bob Dole is going to defeat Bill Clinton in November the way Bob Dole defeats broadleafed weeds in summer. Bob Dole will be adored by children and parents alike as the new low-maintenance, twin-turbine leader of the free world.' ","politics, archive, news, vol 29 issue 14, politics"
135,Federal Law Enforcement Officials Unveil New Food-Crime Equivalency Ratings,"WASHINGTON (AP)' A unilateral caucus of the nation' s law enforcement officials yesterday unveiled America' s new food-crime equivalency ratings for 1996 . Passed unanimously, the ratings take effect May 1 and will be enforced in all 50 states, as well as Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Initially enforced on a state-by-state basis, 1996 will mark the first time the ratings are consistent throughout the nation. The nation' s governors expressed relief that each state' s worst food-crime offenders could no longer simply go across the border to a state with more lenient punishments for certain food crimes. Said Maine Governor William Ryan: ' I am very comfortable knowing that if someone is caught with poultry in my state, they will now be subject to the same criminal charges (manslaughter) as they would in any other state.'

137,American Cancer Society Unveils 1.2 Megaton Anti-Cancer Missile,"The American Cancer Society unveiled a promising new weapon in the war against cancer yesterday, a 1.2-megaton anti-cancer missile. The powerful missile, a converted nuclear warhead fitted with special cancer-eradicating plutonium, has been tested vigorously on cancer patients on a top-secret military atoll near Guam, with a 100 percent cure rate. Pending FDA and Pentagon approval, the weapon could be used on U.S. cancer patients as soon as May. ' This is our boldest and most effective strike yet against this life-taking disease,'  ACS chairman and former McDonnell Douglas CEO William McNair said. ' Our island tests indicate that when the missile is fired at a cancer patient, the disease is instantly eradicated.'  The treatment will work not unlike a medium-range ballistic nuclear missile. It will be computer-locked on its target and launched from an underground silo in Nevada. The missile' s curative powers trigger on impact, exploding with a force 400 times more powerful than that of the 1945 Hiroshima bomb and destroying all cancer cells within a 35-square-mile radius. The missile is said to have some side-effects, including nausea, headaches and the eradication of all other forms of life within a 35-square mile radius. Through March, when testing stopped due to seismic disturbances in the Pacific rim, the $40 million surface-to-patient missile had a 100% success rate, besting such commonly used treatments as chemotherapy (36%), radiation (41%), surgical removal (27%), homeopathy (11%), and prayer (61%). ' In every case, save one or two, the treatment has worked,'  McNair said. ' And, in the cases when the treatment failed, it was only because the patients were not in the designated strike area when the missiles hit.'  Cancer patients expressed hope at the prospect of a new treatment with such a high success rate. ' Though my skin cancer is in remission, I am excited to try this new treatment,'  cancer patient Judith Miles said. ' Why wait the few more months when I can now eliminate it in one fell swoop?'  Added Derrick Thorner, who suffers from lung cancer: ' My cancer is very serious, so I will probably encourage them to use higher mega-tonnage.'  Skeptics of the treatment have expressed concern with the side-effects of the new technology, particularly its tendency to destroy all life and property in the vicinity of the patient. ' Our initial reports indicate that if a patient was treated in, say, New York, where over 14 million people are concentrated in a small area, many if not all of the 14 million could be destroyed along with the cancer cells,'  New England Journal of Medicine editor Dr. Daphne Lehman said. ' Whether that is too large a price to pay to defeat this deadly disease remains to be seen.'  Added American Medical Association chair Dr. Fran Stern: ' Look at Jonas Salk. He is a legend in the medical community. But when he introduced the notion of killing every first-born child to reduce polio, people said he was a genocidal maniac.'

138,Stop Mocking My Antennae,"Quit making fun of my antennae. I' m sick and tired of you slurring my heritage. You, the bastard issue of coarse yeomanry. I' m unique. Only the bluest of blood courses through my veins. And that' s not because I drank some Wisk yesterday. Well, it' s part of the reason. I love Jesus more than anything on this diseased earth. I have decided to build my new church near the E-Z-2 Shop on East De-la-ford. That way, after services, I can stop in there and buy Swishers. Between beatings, my father would tell us tales of the merchant marines, and of the famed lobster-whore of Singapore. My father was the greatest man I ever knew, and he met a tragic demise shortly after contracting the dreaded pleurisy. Actually, it was a virulent strain of scabies. Nonetheless, I have made the solemn vow to not rest a single moment until I have tracked down and killed the American Medical Association. As a citizen of the Nation of the United States I demand an audience with Little Debbie. Why are the individually-wrapped Fudgies whole, and the boxed ones scored? How does she sleep nights? I once knew a little girl in a checked dress, just like her. I already apologized to the family' what more do you want of me? By the way, I didn' t want to mention this before, but you kind of smell. I think you would be wise to consider the use of soap, warm water and clean linens before we proceed any further with our friendship. I' m tired of Washington, with their Marshall Plan, their gasohol, and their metric system! And I resent the fact that the land assessor' s office no longer returns my calls. Down with the tyranny! I think everyone in the U.S. should be gathered into an enormous pen and fed pellets. Except for me. I' d prefer to live in the Shell filling station on Chess Boulevard, because I like the smell of the air hose. Sometimes I dream at night of the Michelin Man slowly rocking, rocking, rocking me to sleep in his big pneumatic arms. Bring back Priscilla' s Pop! I miss the comic stylings of Hollyhock. I never learned if Chester ever bounced his ball off the library steps. You do not end an epic novel in the middle of its narrative! Bring that back and the whist column. Speaking of which, have you seen my ratchet set? I usually kept it in that steamer trunk by the lake. I' ll bet anything those merganser ducks made off with it again. Curse you, merganser ducks! You can' t trust any of your valuables around them. I just counted all the words I have written so far, and the tally comes to 373 (or 374 if you consider ' mention'  a word, which I emphatically refuse to do). For the young peo-ple who may be reading this and are considering taking up the essayist mantle, may I offer this tidbit of sagacity: Journalism is a filthy gutter trade fraught with vice and whoredom. So, as we gaze searchingly into the cerulean sky that shelters us all, we are left to indeed wonder about the meaning, if any, of it all. It is to the Creator that I pose this most humble of queries: Can I go to bed now? I' m both tuckered and nackered and desire sleep.","opinion, archive, commentary, vol 29 issue 14, life on mars lorraine mars, the onion"
139,Racist Figurines March On Washington,"WASHINGTON, DC' Calling themselves ""insulting caricatures born of bigotry"" and ""demeaning portrayals bearing no resemblance to actual human beings or cultures,"" an estimated 400,000 so-called jigaboos, pickaninnies and darky po' boys representing racist statuary from across the U.S. marched on Washington Monday. Decrying their own existence, the figurines demanded that legislators acknowledge them as ""the unwanted remnants of a bygone and hateful era"" and take immediate steps toward abolishing racially stereotyped imagery like themselves. ""Look at me,"" Uncle Ben, a desexualized, rice-peddling ""Good Slave"" archetype, told fellow rallygoers. ""I'm nothing like a real person. Look at my coveralls, my smiling, bug-eyed expression of passivity and subjugation. Clearly, I never should have outlasted the antebellum era, yet I'm still a widely recognized pop-cultural icon. I'm so angry I could boil in just five to ten minutes."" Ben and his female counterpart Aunt Jemima, a genial, syrup-filled ""Matron Servant"" archetype, led the crowd in chanting slogans such as ""Jockey No More"" and ""Hold Your Own Pony!"" Jemima encouraged the crowd to resist caricatured representation of African Americans by hurling themselves from shelves and by falling over on lawns and golf courses. ""We came all the way from a kitchen cabinet in Valdosta, GA,"" said one pair of grinning, apron-wearing salt-and-pepper shakers. ""Never again will we add zesty flavor to soups and meals for The Man."" Another protester, a straw-hatted, gap-toothed, barefoot fisherman commonly used as lawn ornamentation in rural areas, was removed by police after damaging a public birdbath. Led away by authorities amidst the cheers of supportive marchers, the statue told reporters he will go on a hunger strike until he and all images like him are smashed into tiny pieces of ceramic debris. The march began at the Washington Monument and concluded a short distance later at the U.S. Capitol. Featured speakers at the event included not only statuary but other forms of racist iconography as well, including characters from the once-popular children's book Little Black Sambo and several maidservants from Gone With The Wind. In a moving gesture of solidarity, Hollywood detective hero Charlie Chan and his so-called ""hon'able numba' wan son,"" as well as cartoon mouse Speedy Gonzales, spoke on behalf of other racially and culturally stereotyped media constructs. Also in attendance at the rally were famed Mark Twain character Nigger Jim and folk-tale trickster Br'er Rabbit, both of whom cautioned protesters about the difficulties posed by archetypes that, on the surface, appear to be racist but may simultaneously function as an anti-racist critique. Said Jim: ""In the hundred-some years since my creation, critical reappraisals have affirmed me as an enduring symbol of Twain's abolitionist sympathies. Yet these same appraisals acknowledge that my exaggerated, overly stereotypical manner of speaking is at least somewhat problematic."" The presence of Br'er Rabbit' a traditional African folk character brought to America by slaves but later distorted by a white journalist in the ""Africanist"" reductivism of ""Uncle Remus""' angered many rallygoers. He was eventually removed by a team of socio-political literary analysts from Howard University. The controversial rabbit later escaped by convincing his captors to throw him into a briar patch, and his current whereabouts are unknown. The non-violent march, which D.C. police officials praised as the most orderly and well-run protest in recent memory, ended at sunset with a candlelight vigil and ceremonial bonfire of the march's many wooden participants.","politics, archive, culture, news, vol 29 issue 14, politics"
140,Miss America Called Before U.N. Council for Not promoting Enough World Peace,"NEW YORK' Miss America 1996, 24-year-old Angela Pierce, was called into question Sunday during a special U.N. session for what many member nations believe to be her failed promise to effectively promote world peace. According to the U.N.' s special secretary for world peace-related affairs Gavin Theweles, ' Your failure, Miss Pierce, to achieve world peace is in direct conflict with your stated promise to do so in the interview round of the 1995 Miss America Pageant.'  Pierce, a college student from Tacoma, WA, was censured in a U.N. resolution passed by the 64-nation body. It also made reference to her other failed promises, made during the gala pageant held in Atlantic City last July, declaring that she had ' not made the world a significantly safer and more loving place in which to raise her future children,'  and had ' only been marginally supportive of the other girls in the pageant.'  The committee did, however, commend Miss America for looking elegant in evening wear.

147,Area Man Collects All Four,"CAMDEN, NJ' After several weeks of eating at various Camden-area participating Burger King restaurants, local resident Bert Gruhey has succeeded in collecting all four Star Wars glasses, according to a report published yesterday in the Wall Street Journal. ' I have collected all four,'  Gruhey said. ' I have Han, Luke, C-3P0, and Lando. There are no more to collect.'  Burger King spokespeople were equally excited about Gruhey' s accomplishment. ' We are pleased Bert decided to collect all four,'  says Paul Collins, Burger King' s national director of promotions. ' We have been encouraging the collection of all four since this promotion began early last month.'  Collins added that the offer was, however, void where prohibited. The 20th anniversary Star Wars glasses, available for a limited time at participating Burger King restaurants, were extremely desirable to Gruhey, combining many of his interests. ' As someone who enjoys Star Wars, Burger King, collecting and quality, dishwasher-safe glassware, I could not resist this offer,'  he said. Gruhey, owner of a small lawn-care business, acquired the glasses by eating $2.99 Whopper Meal Deals for four consecutive weeks, picking up a different glass each time. The glasses were also sold separately for 99 cents, an option Gruhey almost chose in week four, when the final glass, depicting Han Solo firing his blaster at Storm-troopers, was offered. ' I was aware that no purchase was necessary and after three weeks of Whoppers, I was in the mood to eat something else, like a Whaler,'  Gruhey said. ' But I knew I couldn' t substitute the fish sandwich for the burger and still get the glass free. So it was either get the Whaler and buy the glass separately, or force myself to get the burger.'  But that was the least of Gruhey' s concerns. When he heard of the promotion, he ran to Burger King immediately, as the advertisement clearly stated that the offer was good only while supplies last. ' I knew at any moment supplies could run out,'  Gruhey said. ' There was absolutely no room for slip-up.'  Disaster almost struck in week three, when Gruhey took a weekend trip to Connecticut, one of two states in the U.S. not participating in the offer. ' It was careless of me, because I knew the offer was good only at participating Burger Kings,'  he says. When asked if he plans to use the glasses, Gru-hey said, ' I haven' t even thought a-bout that yet. What' s important to me right now is that I have collected all four.'  Despite Gruhey' s reluctance to disclose his plans, most ex-perts believe he will use them when drinking re-freshing, ice-cold beverages. ' These are tall, clear, attractive glasses, perfect for delicious, carbonated beverages like Coke, Diet Coke and Mr. Pibb,'  said John Lewis, spokesperson for Coca-Cola, Inc. ' Any of those would be excellent, thirst-quenching choices to put in a quality glass such as this.'  According to experts, what makes each glass so desirable is its exciting, colorful depiction of a scene from the 1977 George Lucas sci-fi adventure classic Star Wars. Past promotions, like Hardees' s recent tie-in with the animated film The Pagemaster, did not hold such a lucrative charm for Gruhey. But Burger King' s decision to celebrate the 1997 re-release of Star Wars by giving away the limited-edition glassware generally met with overwhelming enthusiasm from within the promotional glassware-collecting community. ' It was a successful collection, in that I now have all four,'  Gruhey concluded. ' When you think about it, there are no more for me to collect.'

152,Professor Deeply Hurt by Student's Evaluation,"Leon Rothberg, Ph.D., a 58-year-old professor of English Literature at Ohio State University, was shocked and saddened Monday after receiving a sub-par mid-semester evaluation from freshman student Chad Berner. The circles labeled 4 and 5 on the Scan-Tron form were predominantly filled in, placing Rothberg' s teaching skill in the ' below average'  to ' poor'  range. Although the evaluation has deeply hurt Rothberg' s feelings, Berner defended his judgment at a press conference yesterday. ' That class is totally boring,'  said Berner, one of 342 students in Rothberg' s introductory English 161 class. ' When I go, I have to read the school paper to keep from falling asleep. One of my brothers does a comic strip called ' The Booze Brothers.'  It' s awesome.'  The poor rating has left Rothberg, a Rhodes Scholar, distraught and doubting his ability to teach effectively at the university level. ' Maybe I' m just no good at this job,'  said Rothberg, recipient of the 1993 Jean-Foucault Lacan award from the University of Chicago for his paper on public/private feminist deconstructive discourse in the early narratives of Catherine of Siena. ' Chad' s right. I am totally boring.'  In the wake of the evaluation, Rothberg is considering canceling his fall sabbatical to the University of Geneva, where he is slated to serve as a Henri Bynum-Derridas Visiting Scholar. Instead, Rothberg may take a rudimentary public speaking course as well as offer his services to students like Berner, should they desire personal tutoring. ' The needs of my first-year students come well before any prestigious personal awards offered to me by international academic assemblies,'  Rothberg said. ' After all, I have dedicated my life to the pursuit of knowledge, and to imparting it to those who are coming after me. I know that' s why these students are here, so I owe it to them.'  Though Rothberg, noted author of The Violent Body: Marxist Roots of Postmodern Homoerotic Mysticism and the Feminine Form in St. Augustine' s Confessions, has attempted to contact Berner numerous times by telephone, Berner has not returned his calls, leading Rothberg to believe that Berner is serious in his condemnation of the professor. ' I' m always stoned when he calls, so I let the answering machine pick it up,'  said Berner, who maintains a steady 2.3 GPA. ' My roommate just got this new bong that totally kicks ass. We call it Sky Lab.'  Those close to Rothberg agree that the negative evaluation is difficult to overcome. ' Richard is trying to keep a stiff upper lip around his colleagues, but I know he' s taking it very hard,'  said Susan Feinstein-Rothberg, a fellow English professor and Rothberg' s wife of 29 years. ' He knows that students like Chad deserve better.'  When told of Rothberg' s thoughts of quitting, Berner became angry. ' He' d better finish up the class,'  Berner said. ' I need those three humanities credits to be eligible to apply to the business school next year.'  The English Department administration at Ohio State is taking a hard look at Rothberg' s performance in the wake of Berner' s poor evaluation. ' Students and the enormous revenue they bring in to our institution are a more valued commodity to us than faculty,'  Dean James Hewitt said. ' Although Rothberg is a distinguished, tenured professor with countless academic credentials and knowledge of 21 modern and ancient languages, there is absolutely no excuse for his boring Chad with his lectures. Chad must be entertained at all costs.' ","local, education, archive, news, vol 29 issue 12, local"
153,Point Counterpoint: Humidity,"""What We Need Is More Humidity"", ""Humidity Must Be Destroyed"" By Duracraft Natural Warm Moisture Humidifier, Model DH-901 By Edison 25 pt. Dehumidifier, Model DHE25W Is there anything in this world more wonderful than humidity? I know, it' s a rhetorical question. There has been a lot of talk lately by certain parties, and you know who I' m talking about, when it comes to the issue of humidity. And let me say this right off the bat: I love humidity. I love giving it, especially in places where it doesn' t already exist. But selfishness aside, humidity works for everybody. Here' s why: I restore moisture to the air to help prevent dry skin and chapped lips. Physicians often recommend moisture to help relieve cold and flu symptoms and dry, scratchy throats. And of course, adding moisture to the air protects furniture and plants from damaging dryness and minimizes the annoyance of static electricity. I feature a two-gallon output per day and humidify up to 1175 square feet. I have a clear, removable tank which makes refill checks effortless. I feature the Mist Breatherûûb Safety System which automatically shuts mist off if tank is empty, removed or tipped over. I feature a limited three-year warranty and an easy-to-read on/off indicator light. And, something you may not know, my heating element purifies water to remove bacteria. So the dehumidifiers can talk their talk, but we know they aren' t going to walk the walk. We cannot now, nor ever, peacefully co-exist. I am sworn to destroy them and everything they represent, and it is that which I will do. The debate ends here. I been hearing a lot of talk about humidifiers lately. And I been hearing a lot of talk by humidifiers lately. And I don' t like it one bit. Why? Because as everybody knows, humidifiers, and humidity in general, is a horrible, horrible thing. Everyone knows it, but for the record, let me illuminate some simple truths: Humidity makes everything damp and wet and soggy. It ruins fragile documents and paintings, and cuts down the lifespan of photographs. And you better believe it will put mold on your bathroom tile. The worst part is, it' s everywhere. How do we best combat the menace? Simple, the Edison 25 pt. Dehumidifier. But just what do I bring to the table? How about rugged construction, automatic shut-off, and a continuous drain option? That not enough for you. Well, I' ll throw in a variable control humidistat, a full bucket indicator light and an automatic de-icer that prevents freeze-up. And for good measure, why don' t you count an air filter among my assets. That' s a lot of machine for your money. And I swear to you, on my honor as a proud member of the Edison multi-national corporate line, I will fight humidity every day, with every watt of energy the good Lord saw fit to construct me with. Humidity must die! You hear that, Duracraft? I' m coming after you, with an empty water collection bucket and a whole lotta ste","archive, archive, vol 29 issue 12, the onion"

As soon as I answered the phone I realized it was her birthday! Boy, was my face red. Of course, I had to talk to her then because by the time the show was over, she' d be in bed. When we were done talking, they had moved on to the stupid categories like ' Best Short Film'  (Hello! Does anyone actually see these things?) and ' Best Editing.'  (Like that' s important!) So, I talked to some people, and for those of you who missed the proceedings, here' s what we both missed: Actor Mel Gibson got a lot of awards, including Best Actor and Best Film for The Brave Heart, an action movie set in Ireland. I saw the trailers on TV with him wearing a skirt. He didn' t look so macho, ladies, I assure you. I have two choice words for you Mr. Gibson' Thigh Master. Actor Nicholas Cage won Best Actor as well, something I' ve been predicting since his days on 21 Jump Street. That guy can take even the smallest role and breathe life into it! Whoopi Goldberg said some very political things in her monologue (at least that part I saw). Good for you, Whoopi! Item! My friend Loni Anderson, who I met at a book signing last fall, has been turning down offers left and right these days! Why is this? I asked her at the signing, and she played it cool. ' What offers?'  she said. I was going to ask her more, but she was done signing my book and asked me to be considerate of the other people in line. What can I say? When Loni asks, what can I do but comply? Now it turns out that she has a big television part. I knew it! (As for the secret you' ve been dying to know, she signed my book, ' To Jacky, All the best, Loni.' ) Basketball fever! Everybody' s catching it! Item! Did anyone see me on the Six O' Clock News last Wednesday? They were doing those ' man on the street'  interviews, and I happened to be passing by. No, I wasn' t asked my opinion (and it' s a good thing, because I was in a hurry to return videos), but I passed right behind someone who was being interviewed. So yes, that was my head that was seen on televisions across the city. I' m glad they got my good side.

161,Daredevil Produce Manager to Attempt Largest-Ever Plum Display,"The world holds its breath this morning as Jim Pobinsky, a produce department manager for the Star Foods supermarket in Omaha, NE, prepares to create the largest display of plums in modern grocery history. ' We' ve got two full pallets of plums coming in on the truck at 10. That' s a lot of plums,'  says Pobinsky, in a tense interview a mere day before he runs the fruit gauntlet. The attempt has garnered a huge public response, not unlike Evil Knievel' s famed cycle jump across the Grand Canyon in 1975, except this time it' s not crossing a canyon, it' s stacking plums. The estimated five-foot pile, to be fashioned in a roughly pyramidal shape, is expected to dazzle a whole store full of anxious spectators watching on location while they shop. ' It' s really not that big a deal,'  Pobinsky says with characteristic modesty. ' You should have seen the new floor waxer we got in last week. That was exciting.'  Developed over 16 years in the produce business, all of Pobinsky' s fruit piling skills will be required to pull off the feat. Lightning-fast hand-eye coordination, complex geometric calculations and sheer brute strength will serve as Pobinsky' s weapons in his struggle for plum order and harmony. The produce manager must be operating at 100% to defeat the fruit, which is only too ready to roll off the table and plunge his department into chaos. ' I hope I can finish the display before noon, so I can freshen up the greens section before taking off for lunch,'  Pobinsky says. However, if Pobinsky is too hasty, or lets his concentration slip for a moment, his chance at ever-lasting grocery super-stardom will come crashing down' along with the plum pile that would have made him a legend in both the fruit and vegetable aisle and the neighboring deli and meats section. Donna Laban, Pobinsky' s wife and Star Foods'  grocery samples coordinator, is understandably nervous for her husband' s safety in this high-stakes game of produce display brinkmanship. ' I always remind him to lift with his legs, not his back,'  Laban says. ' Some of those boxes can be heavy, especially if the plums are ripe and juicy, engorged with delicious nectar.'  Laban also stated that, if necessary, she would leave her samples post by the meat department in order to provide moral support during his heroic effort. ' We' re going to have cocktail wieners on toothpicks. If you come in tomorrow, you should try one,'  she says, adding but a second later, ' They' re free.'  Pobinsky had responded quickly to nature' s challenge, preparing in advance for the plum onslaught. ' I read in last month' s American Produce Journal that rainfall was heavy in many plum-producing areas. I knew then that we' d most likely have plenty of plums in a few weeks,'  Pobinsky says. ' So I saved a lot of cardboard boxes to stack around the plum table, to widen the actual base so all those plums could fit.'  Tim Wiegens, 17, a produce stocker under Pobinsky' s supervision, will play a supporting role in the daredevil manager' s fruit-stacking gambit. ' I' ll basically be opening the boxes with an X-acto knife, and Mr. Pobinsky will do the actual stacking,'  Wiegens says. ' I tried to do a nectarine table by myself once, but I messed it up pretty bad. Mr. Pobinsky took me into the cooler and yelled at me.'  In a final statement before proceeding home to prepare for his moment of glory, Pobinsky asked his millions of supporters worldwide to come in tomorrow and witness his chance at immortality within the world of produce display engineering. ' Don' t forget, plums are 99 cents a pound all this week at the store,'  he says. ' That' s a special price that will last until this Friday.' ","local, archive, news, vol 29 issue 11, local"

Other students on campus, unable to compete with the fraternity' s outrageous theme parties and attractive, well-maintained house (including vomit-encrusted pool table), decried the greed of the fraternity and demanded that ZBT disband immediately.

169,World's Longest Wall Completed," No one has ever built a wall this great,'  mayor says PEMBROKE, IL' The Bernstein-Grey construction company announced the completion of the world' s longest wall yesterday, putting the final touches on the single greatest feat in U.S. architectural history. The Big Wall of Pembroke, a joint effort between the town' s beautification committee and the board of tourism, measures a full 23 1/3 feet long by 11 2/3 feet tall by 36 inches thick. Its construction began in December 1995 and ended yesterday amid great fanfare and excitement. ' No one has built a wall of this size and scope in the history of the world,'  said Bernstein/Grey president Arthur Bernstein, who personally oversaw a project that was largely scorned by the U.S. architectural community. ' I challenge anyone to even attempt such a grand wall.'  As all 2,300 residents of Pembroke gathered at the wall' s base for a ceremonial ribbon-cutting, Mayor Arty Leucking addressed the crowd. ' We are very, very pleased with the wall,'  Leucking said. ' There were plenty of naysayers in this community, people who doubted its feasibility. But their protests are forever silenced now that the finished wall has been unveiled. It is indeed a mighty, even ' great'  wall.'  Added Pembroke alder Kate Dermot: ' The wall is huge. If there is a wall this large anywhere else, I' ve never seen it, and I' ve been all over the tri-county area. It' s even visible by helicopter, provided you don' t go too high.'  From the outset, the Big Wall had the trappings of an engineering impossibility. Architects the world over were consulted, but all but one turned down the project for undisclosed reasons. The job was eventually accepted by Bernstein-Grey, a prestigious firm based in nearby Grainger, IN. The firm submitted and saw rejected nearly two dozen designs before a final plan was agreed upon. ' We were very nervous about the scale of the wall, its sheer enormity,'  architect Ken Millin said. ' Consequently, we were overly cautious in our design. We submitted plans for a 15-foot wall made of plastic, a 19-foot wall made of ceramic-covered aluminum, and a 20-foot wall made of a uranium shell with a liquid mercury-based ore center. They were all turned down because they were too small.'  The final design employs a series of interlocking blocks of fired clay stacked atop one another and covered with an experimental plaster substitute. ' That design we knew was a keeper,'  Millin said. ' It combines architectural dynamics the world has never seen' something that is going to last 10, maybe 20 years of harsh southern Illinois winters.'  Despite the overwhelming excitement surrounding the wall, its construction was not without problems. In January, a strong wind destroyed two-thirds of the structure. Although there were no injuries, a full eight feet of the wall had to be rebuilt. Further tragedy marred the wall in early March, when construction worker Bart Meadows, who was working at the top, fell off his ladder. He suffered a bruise to his shoulder and scraped his knee on a pebble. ' It hurt a lot,'  Meadows said. ' I had to go get a Band-Aid, and for the next week, every time I lifted my arm it was kinda sore.'  Even when the Big Wall was proposed, a dream of a small but dedicated group of boosters, opposition within the community nearly derailed it. ' It wasn' t that they couldn' t see the necessity for the wall,'  Dermot said. ' It' s just that a project of this magnitude had never been conceived before. A wall this large? Impossible!'  The Big Wall has spawned a number of businesses selling memorabilia, including T-shirts with slogans such as, ' You saw a bigger wall where?'  and ' I went to the Big Wall of Pembroke and here' s a T-shirt that proves it.'  Now that the wall is complete, plans will commence for new, four-sided hollow structures for human habitation, allowing Pembroke residents to leave their dank cave dwellings. Said Leucking: ' The only glitch is that the proposed structures have a propensity for letting in rain. Once we solve that, we will be able to live in comfort and ease until our God comes down and takes us home.' ","local, archive, news, vol 29 issue 10, local"
170,Clinton Blown Away,"by Delicious Flavor of Trident Gum WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP)'  President Clinton is recovering today after being ' shot dead'  by the flavor of Trident Sugarless Spearmint Gum late Monday night. The President was walking out of the Washington Hilton, where he had just given a speech, when he received three ' bursts of taste'  from the gum, which was quickly wrestled out of his mouth by Secret Service agents. ' That' s some gum!'  screamed the President as he was pulled into his limousine and hurried to Memorial Hospital, where he was pronounced ' satisfied on arrival'  by Dr. Robert Orson, the president' s personal physician. ' The President was struck three times on the tongue by the most delicious gum he' s ever had,'  Orson said. ' His taste buds never had a chance.'  According to eyewitnesses, the President was waving to the crowd and talking to Secretary of Defense William Perry when, unseen by Secret Service agents, the gum snuck into his mouth. ' You could see immediately something had happened,'  Perry said. ' He began to smile broadly and his eyes lit up. The third chew is what got him. The first two just opened his eyes to the taste, but the third sent him reeling into a whole new vista of flavor.'  The entire nation was glued to its television sets throughout the night, mourning what TV commentator George Will termed ' the death of our collective gustatory innocence.'  Vice President Al Gore has assumed temporary duties as Chief Executive while doctors and security personnel stay on a 24-hour Flavor Watch. Meanwhile, questions are being asked about how a gum so staggeringly delicious could have been allowed into the President' s mouth in the first place. Spokesman Roger Vasquez confirmed today that the Secret Service had closed its file on Trident Sugarless Spearmint gum in 1993, believing it to be ' insufficiently minty'  to pose a security risk to the President. ' Were we wrong? Obviously,'  Vasquez admitted. ' This is a gum that should not have been allowed within 20 feet of the President. That' s how mint- astic it is!'  This is not the first time Trident gum has struck a Chief Executive, according to Trident executive Howard Stanton. In 1976 President Gerald Ford was ' gravely wowed'  when shaking hands at a San Francisco campaign stop. But that incident was before Trident began using aspartane, a remarkably sweet sugar substitute, in its gum. ' The two chews inflicted on President Ford, while flavorful, were only moderately chew-licious,'  Stanton said. ' But our new sugarless gum is indistinguishable from regular gums and carries five times the palate-pleasin'  power of our 1976 brand.'  Harry Williams, a taxi driver from Portland, Oregon, echoed the thoughts and feelings of a nation. ' Of course you see this kind of thing all the time on TV, but when it happens to the President. . . it' s unfathomable. Unfathomable that Trident Sugarless Spearmint gum is so delicious.'  ' At least he didn' t get a chance to see how long-lasting the flavor is,'  Stanton noted. ' That would have been a national ordeal that might never have ended' a Vietnam of flavor!'

177,PR Firm Kills Innocent Child," Kills is a Harsh Word,'  Spokesperson Says The prestigious Chicago-based public relations firm of Lawler, Schneider & Epps, whose impressive client roster includes such giants as RJR/Nabisco, PepsiCo and Bristol-Myers/Squibb, killed an innocent child yesterday, beating 7-year-old Chicago resident Jamie Wood to death in a secluded section of Grant Park. ' ' Kills'  is a harsh word,'  said Lawler, Schneider & Epps spokesperson Elaine Scott of the murder. ' We prefer to think that a young boy sadly passed away in a manner that was sudden, unfortunate, and perhaps even avoidable. We are taking significant steps to ensure that such a thing never happens again.'  According to police reports, late Monday night, several top executives from Lawler, Schneider & Epps cornered Wood and began taunting him and asking him where his mommy was. When the frightened Wood began to run, the executives chased the boy down and repeatedly hit him about the face and neck with a metal pipe. Cook County coroners pronounced the boy dead at the scene. ' This incident was largely the result of miscommunication among senior firm executives,'  said John Smalley, Senior Account Supervisor in charge of the firm' s food and beverage accounts. ' Somewhere along the way, signals got crossed and the go-ahead was given to begin smashing Jamie' s skull with a pipe. Once that happened, everyone was under the impression that the plan was to batter the boy mercilessly.'  In a damage control effort, the firm has undertaken a major PR campaign playing up the fact that it has never taken a child' s life before. In addition to television and magazine ads, billboards will be put up all over Chicago reading, ' Thanks to Lawler, Schneider & Epps, Over Two Million Children Are Still Alive in Chicago Today.'  Says another one: ' Lawler, Schneider & Epps: Chicago' s Only ' Kids First'  PR Firm. Why Else Would We Have Never Killed One Before?'  One magazine ad favorably compares the firm to a farm thresher, a piece of equipment that, on average, results in the accidental death of 15 children each year. ' Who would you trust your children to?'  the ad reads. ' The creative minds at Lawler, Schneider & Epps? Or a deadly farm thresher?'  According to Cook County D.A. Laurence Kirby, the PR executives involved in the killing will likely have to stand trial, a possibility that excites them. ' We' re all very excited to see how the American justice system works,'  said David Walsh, a Senior Copywriter implicated in the murder. ' Being put on trial gives us the rare chance to see it all from the inside. We couldn' t be happier with this turn of events.'  If found guilty, Walsh and the others face life imprisonment, and possibly execution. ' Being put to death would be an exciting new experience,'  Walsh said. ' I' m sure it' s something I' d never forget. Nothing could really be better than that.'  According to Senior Partner Matthew Epps, despite the tragic loss of young life, much good has come out of the fatal beating. ' The Wood family is far better off without Jamie,'  he said. ' This will save thousands of dollars a year on food and clothes for an extra child, and free up nearly $80,000 that would have gone to his college education. Plus, Jamie' s parents can now focus all of their energy, attention and love on their remaining child, 9-year-old Nikki, and never again have to worry about dividing it between the two.'  To ensure that Lawler, Schneider & Epps does not lose any valuable corporate clients due to the potentially damaging murder, the firm has invested $3 million in a damage control campaign. ' There is always that danger that someone like Beatrice or Frito-Lay would jump to conclusions about our ability to conduct a PR campaign because we killed a young boy,'  Epps said. ' We want to make it clear that we are still fully capable of providing them with the best PR imaginable. And we have the color slides and 3-D pie charts to prove it.'

178,Monk Gloats Over Yoga Championship," I am the serenest!'  he says LHASA, TIBET' Employing the brash style that first brought him to prominence, Sri Dhananjai Bikram won the fifth annual International Yogi Competition yesterday with a world-record point total of 873.6. ' I am the serenest!'  Bikram shouted to the estimated crowd of 20,000 yoga fans, vigorously pumping his fists. ' No one is serener than Sri Dhananjai Bikram' I am the greatest monk of all time!'  Bikram averaged 1.89 breaths a minute during the two-hour competition, nearly .3 fewer than his nearest competitor, second-place finisher and two-time champion Sri Salil ' The Hammer'  Gupta. The heavily favored Gupta was upset after the loss. ' I should be able to beat that guy with one lung tied,'  Gupta said. ' I' m beside myself right now, and I don' t mean trans-bodily.'  Bikram got off to a fast start at the Lhasa meet, which like most major competitions, is a six-event affair. In the first event, he attained total consciousness (TC) in just 2 minutes, 34 seconds, and set the tone for the rest of the meet by repeatedly shouting, ' I' m blissful! You blissful?! I' m blissful!'  to the other yogis. Bikram, 33, burst onto the international yoga scene with a gold-mandala performance at the 1994 Bhutan Invitational. At that competition he premiered his aggressive style, at one point in the flexibility event sticking his middle toes out at the other yogis. While no prohibition exists against such behavior, according to Yoga League Commissioner Swami Prabhupada, such behavior is generally considered ' un-Buddhalike.'  ' I don' t care what the critics say,'  Bikram said. ' Sri Bikram is just gonna go out there and do Sri Bikram' s own yoga thing.'  Before the Bhutan meet, Bikram had never placed better than fourth. Many said he had forsaken rigorous training for the celebrity status accorded by his Bhutan win, endorsing Nike' s new line of prayer mats and supposedly dating the Hindu goddess Shakti. But his performance this week will regain for him the number one computer ranking and earn him new respect, as well as for his coach Mahananda Vasti, the controversial guru some have called Bikram' s ' guru.'  ' My special training diet for Bikram of one super-charged, carbo-loaded grain of rice per day was essential to his win,'  Vasti said. The defeated Gupta denied that Bikram' s taunting was a factor in his inability to attain TC. ' I just wasn' t myself today,'  Gupta commented. ' I wasn' t any self today. I was an egoless particle of the universal no-soul.'  In the second event, flexibility, Bikram maintained the lead by supporting himself on his index fingers for the entire 15 minutes while touching the back of his skull to his lower spine. The feat was matched by Gupta, who first used the position at the 1990 Tokyo Zen-Off. ' That' s my meditative position of spiritual ecstasy, not his,'  remarked Gupta. ' He stole my thunder.'  Bikram denied the charge, saying, ' Gupta' s been talking like that ever since he was a 3rd century Egyptian slave-owner.'  Nevertheless, a strong showing by Gupta in the third event, the shotput, placed him within a lotus petal of the lead at the competition' s halfway point. But event number four, the contemplation of unanswerable riddles known as koans, proved the key to victory for Bikram. The koan had long been thought the weak point of his spiritual arsenal, but his response to today' s riddle' ' Show me the face you had before you were born' ' was reportedly ' extremely illuminative,'  according to Commissioner Prabhupada. While koan answers are kept secret from the public for fear of exposing the un-initiated multitudes to the terror of universal truth, insiders claim his answer had Prab-hupada and the two other judges ' highly enlightened.'  With the event victory, Bikram built himself a nearly insurmountable lead, one he sustained through the yak-milk churn and breathing events to come away with the upset victory.","world, archive, news, vol 29 issue 08, the onion"
179,114-Year-Old Attributes Longevity to Sheer Random Chance,"MILFORD, WY' Mayor Hammond Forsythe officially declared Monday ' Hazel McCreeley Day,'  and why not? After all, if you' d lived through over 41,500 of them, wouldn' t you deserve one too? With pomp, circumstance and cake, the oldest living American celebrated the start of the 14th year of her second century of life here amid her friends at the Milford Nursing Home. But make no mistake' old age does not mean old heart! ' What a crock of shit,'  re-marked the feisty McCreeley, playfully feigning both inability and unwillingness to blow out even one of her 114 candles. ' What a flaming crock of shit this whole day isû€f For the love of Jesus, honor somebody accomplishing something, not someone whose body is spiting its mind by staying alive.'  Asked for the secret to her long life, the perky, silver-coifed McCreeley quipped: ' Dumb luck. Do any of you have even a rudimentary understanding of probability? Extrapolate the bell curve of life expectancy for a quarter of a billion people and see for your goddamn selves.'  The frisky matriarch continued. ' By probabilistic rights, somebody in America ought to be 119. Only one person being 114 years old is an incredible statistical deviation.'  ' Great, I pissed in my diaper again,'  wise-cracked the chipper McCreeley, who still has the sense of humor she inherited from her mother, the wife of a pioneer rancher who gave birth to her only child, Hazel, on March 5, 1882, during the administration of Chester A. Arthur. She grew up during the tail-end of the legendary Old West period, graduated high school when Teddy Roosevelt was president, turned 51 one day after the first inauguration of his relative Franklin, and was eligible for Medicare by 18 years when it was first created! Thinking of those times, McCreeley wistfully recalls them as ' a total goddamn blurE€¦ Everything before this morning is a brain-fart for me.'  The bouncy centedecarian has lived in Milford all her life, spending 53 years running the general store which she founded with her husband, Herb. Herb died in 1958 at the age of 79.

' The representative from New York' s 14th District is hereby condemned for her unapologetic enunciation of these hateful, abusive words, which not only brought disgrace to this esteemed body but were incredibly demeaning to all womankind,'  House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said as he read aloud the official rebuke, adding that as a woman herself, Ocasio-Cortez should have known better than to speak aloud the unconscionable term, let alone read it into the Congressional Record.

188,"Cop Kills Own Partner, Vows To Track Self Down","DETROIT, MI' At an emotional press conference yesterday, Detroit police officer John McCullough an-nounced his guilt in the murder of longtime partner Mitch Peterson and vowed not to rest until he tracks himself down. The veteran McCullough, who worked side by side with the slain officer for more than 12 years, promised he would do whatever it takes to bring himself to justice. ' Last Thursday, I senselessly killed my partner and friend, Mitch Peterson, in a Detroit alleyway in cold blood,'  a visibly shaken McCullough told the assembled press, friends, and family members. ' Well, I stand before you today to swear that I will not sleep until I find me and make me pay for this brutal crime.'  McCullough concluded the press conference by holding up a photograph of himself and pointing. ' I' m coming after you, buddy,'  he said. ' And when I do, it' ll be the sorriest day of your life.'  According to McCullough, at 11:20 p.m., he cornered Peterson and fired six shots into his abdomen and chest. He then raced to the side of his fallen partner and held him in his arms. Said McCullough: ' As Mitch lay there dying, he said to me, ' It' s okay, buddy. It' s okay. I' m going to a much better place. But promise me just one thing: You' ll find the bastard who killed me.' '  The hard-nosed McCul-lough has already taken a number of steps to ensure he does not go far. In addition to revoking his driver' s license and canceling all his credit cards, he has slashed the tires on his car. ' That should make it a lot more difficult for me to escape,'  he said. ' Now I' ll have to travel by bus or train, and I' ll have a limited supply of money.'  McCullough has also posted fliers with his picture on kiosks, on telephone poles, and in store windows throughout Detroit. To increase his chances of catching himself, the beardless McCullough is making sure to shave every day. ' If I grow facial hair, people may not recognize me as the guy from the flier. That would make it a lot harder to nail myself.'  ' I gotta get into this guy' s head, crawl around for a while,'  said McCullough, who has staked out his favorite bars and asked around town about himself. ' I' ve got to learn his every move.'  McCullough is reportedly so consumed with tracking himself down that his boss, Sgt. Dick Thomas, threatened to take him off the case. ' Thomas told me to cool it, or he' ll hand the case over to Ramsey,'  McCullough said. ' I told him, ' Forget it, Sarge, this guy' s mine.' '  Even after Thomas threatened to take away his badge, McCullough remained defiant. ' I don' t care, Sarge' it' s personal,'  he said. As confident as McCullough is that he will catch himself, he remains skeptical about what will happen afterwards. ' Sure, I could nail myself today. I know my movements,'  he said. ' But the way our justice system works, I' d be out on the streets within hours.'  Making McCullough all the more determined is the fact that this is not the first police officer he has killed. ' Five years ago, I shot Mac Schuyler, a damn good cop and a buddy of mine, in the back during a routine robbery investigation,'  McCullough said. ' The message is clear: I must be stopped.'  No motive for the murder has yet been established, and McCullough himself is puzzled. ' I have no idea why I would do something like this to my own partner and best friend,'  he said. ' It just makes no sense at all.'  Ironically, Peterson was set to retire in just one week. Added McCullogh: ' I can' t wait ' til I get my hands on me.'

190,Deadly New Virus Found To Be 'Real Squiggly',"Scientists and doctors at Princeton' s Institute for Advanced Studies, working around the clock in pursuit of a cure for the mysterious new ' SeloThoxxyn-P Five'  virus, yesterday announced the stunning discovery that the virus is ' real squiggly.'  The news comes as a surprise to many medical observers who had previously known only that it was ' circle-ish'  and ' red with purple spots.'  The virus kills humans over a three-day period by causing intense swelling of the neck, tremendous pressure buildup and eventual explosive decapitation, rocketing the severed head distances of up to 50 feet at speeds measured at 95 miles per hour. Though the virus, which can only be transmitted when the human head is inserted in the colon of a black bear, is a top medical priority, yesterday' s squiggliness discovery marks the first breakthrough in the search for a cure. ' Now that we have a clearly defined picture of the virus' s squiggly nature, we are in a better position to assess and measure its other characteristics, such as its wiggliness and how blobby it is,'  Dr. Andover Phlebehausen, Chief Medical Researcher in charge of the team, told reporters. Phlebehausen noted that not only is the virus squiggly, but it is also 73% more squiggly than the microorganic squiggliness average, approaching levels of squiggliness previously thought to exist only in such extra-squiggly things as jellyfish and Gummi Wormûûb candy products. The virus has thus been classified not just as squiggly, but what scientists call ' real squiggly.'  ' We know that it is squiggly,'  the Institute' s report states. ' But there is still much to be learned: Is it sticky? Smooshy? How yucko is it? Does it go ' blurp'  and, if not, why? If you put salt on it, what happens? If you had two of the viruses in a jar, and you shook the jar, would they fight? We may never know the answers to these questions.'  Despite the $10 billion poured into ST-p5, or ' Neck Bomb'  as it is commonly known, since mid-December, authorities stress that more funding is needed if the search for a cure is to continue. ' We' re very proud of our findings,'  Phlebehausen said. ' But we simply cannot do more without an additional, oh, say, $200 billion.'  Johns Hopkins' s Dr. Jergens Heuyk-Haak agreed. ' Mi-croscopes and those little glass slidey things that go under them are expensive, finely tuned instruments that need to be thrown away and replaced after each use to ensure proper freshness.

191,Jesus Free After Killing Hooker," I am above the law,'  He says ST. LOUIS, MO' Jesus the Christ, Son of Yahweh, is free on bond today after being arrested for the murder of Wanda Jimenez, 38, an East Side prostitute. Jesus confessed to the killing at His arraignment yesterday. ' Let he who is without sin cast the first stone,'  Jesus said to a hushed crowd of onlookers outside the municipal courthouse after His arraignment. ' Hey, the bitch had it coming.'  The judge sympathized, ruling that he had grown to love Jesus through a 36-year-long ' personal relationship'  with the Christ cultivated through weekly church services. ' I consider Jesus to be my personal savior,'  Judge Havish Greegham said. ' I therefore cannot send Him to jail.'  According to police reports, at 1:16 a.m. Friday, Jesus had sex with Jimenez in an alley behind the Paradise Row adult movie theater on King Street. The victim was then beaten brutally about the face, stabbed 17 times in the chest and abdomen with a screwdriver, then strangled. Said Police Detective Harold Trutmand: ' The evidence indicates that Jesus assaulted the victim over a dispute, presumably the result of His refusal to pay for sex.'  Christ, 32, is a traveling iconoclastic preacher and healer. He has a long criminal record in his native Middle East, including charges of incitement and heresy filed by the Roman government. He had previously been banned from a local temple by Pharisees for vandalism and public disturbance. He is also known to associate with tax collectors and adulterers. Resurrected three days after His death, Jesus was revealed to be the long-awaited Messiah, or ' Christ,'  foretold in the Old Testament. According to official records, this was a holy event that created a new religion and transformed the history of the Western world. ' Christians'  today number over one billion. Christians everywhere have come forward in support of Jesus. ' He' s my personal savior and I love Him,'  a smiling Cindy Hevertsen, 15, said at a rally outside the First Missouri Con-gregational Church. ' And I' m sure God in His love will forgive Him for killing the hooker, or whatever He did.'  Added Hevertsen: ' Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, Romans, 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 Thessalonians, 2 Thessalonians, 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, Titus, Philemon, Hebrews, James, 1 Peter, 2 Peter, 1 John, 2 John, 3 John, Jude, Revelation.'  The difficult role of prosecuting the Son of God has been assigned to County Prosecutor Sam Edlerbet. Outside his downtown office, a mob of 60,000 Christian protesters has backed up traffic for an eight-mile radius. Brandishing placards that read, ' He died for you too, Christ Jailer,'  ' Edlerbet, spawn of Satan,'  and ' Iscariot, Pilate, Edlerbet' Burn! Burn! Burn!'  the protesters create a constant roar of vitriol not unlike a raging hailstorm that permeates the walls and cubicles of every office building in the city. Said Edlerbet: ' I was hired by the County Board Chairman to prosecute illegal activity committed in the County of Brefford, and must put forth my best effort in the performance of that duty.'  Though Edlerbet did not admit to being frightened, his co-workers claim he has been ' tense'  since the legion of protesters firebombed his car, obliterated his suburban St. Louis home, and promised to ' tear the flesh from his body and feed it to Lucifer' s jackals.'  Based on Biblical precedent, St. Louis District Attorney Frank Menchett is considering throwing out the charges on the basis of Jesus' s holy forgiveness from God. Said Menchett: ' A power superseding that of the State of Missouri is that of the loving grace of a heavenly deity, who may have an authority to forgive, overruling that of the governor of Missouri.'  Jesus' s summary judgment is set for March 1.","religion, archive, justice, news, vol 29 issue 06, the onion"
192,"Local Harlot Exposes Face, Neck"," Nothing was left to the imagination,'  says Damascus-area shopkeeper This story originally appeared in the Damascus Herald-Star. The names have been changed to protect the innocent. An area harlot exposed her face and neck to the naked eyes of several area men yesterday, stirring deep within them filthy and sinful desires. The harlot, area seamstress and mother of five Fatma al-Qaawi, was witnessed in the act of removing her protective headgear and veil in the town marketplace, in plain view of the public. According to witnesses'  reports, after exposing the men to her brazen display of wanton, uncensored sexuality, al-Qaawi rocked back and forth slightly, allowing her hair to blow gently in the mid-morning breeze, deliberately goading the men into thoughts of hell-spawned lustful abandon. Although she quickly replaced the shawl and veil, the damage had already been done. Experts agree that in doffing her outerwear, the temptress was clearly in league with Satan. Witnesses reported experiencing feelings of rapture, awe and trembling admiration of her beauty, all known effects of succubi sent by Lucifer to suck Heaven' s virtue from the souls of men. ' Her hair shone with a thousand shimmering strands of purest gossamer, framing her lovely, nude face with a glory worthy of the raiments of Gabriel,'  witness Rafiq al-Jabir said. ' It was clear that she was a powerful succubus, a vassal of demonic spirits from beneath Hell.'  Al-Jabir then retreated to a private chamber to scourge his back with merciless flaying in an attempt to quell his spiritual pain. The lust al-Qaawi provoked may have overcome and eternally corrupted the various men who could not avert their eyes in time to avoid glimpsing her exposed shame. Shortly after exposing herself, the harlot was stoned in the public square, saving the town' s souls from the risk of growing contamination at the hands of her lurid, sinful perversion of all that is holy. Reports as of press time indicate that many of the witnesses'  wives and daughters are currently forsaking their usual regimen of duties and instead singing triumphant hymns of praise and adoration to He Who Rules On High in thanks for the harlot' s death. ' The hair, the face, even a slight wedge of skin below the neckline' nothing was left to the imagination,'  one anonymous witness said. Shortly after seeing the shocking parade of scantily clad female flesh, the witness was overwhelmed by an intense compulsion to woo the woman, plying her affections with gifts of the finest ointments, vowing his undying devotion and forsaking all others, until the stoning began. ' Her mortal frame was a vessel for damnation' s temptresses to walk the earth in human form, leading the righteous away from God, and thus, needed to be brutally broken and cut down by the redemptive hand' the only kind of justice a harlot can know: sheer bloodletting,'  said area rug trader Malik al-Faziz, who organized the impromptu stoning by pointing at al-Qaawi and shouting, ' Harlot!'  while brandishing a large rock until others came to his aid. Reports indicate that so great was the temptation to sin caused by al-Qaawi' s disclosure that 30 or more men felt a need to purify themselves by participating in the woman' s stoning, which observers said took less than three minutes. ' I am very sorry that I am related to my late sister, henceforth disowned by my family and referred to only as She Who Cannot Be Named,'  said al-Qaawi' s youngest sibling Yasmeen in a desperate attempt to restore family honor. The harlot' s corpse has been dragged through the streets in accordance with the law and then cut into pieces and fed to crows by her sons, all of whom have written to the town elders begging that their mother' s depravity be forever stricken from all public record. ' It is true that we are but lowly whoresons,'  a portion of their letter read, ' but we pray that in God' s wisdom our grandchildren will not be known as whores-grandchildren.'  The Council of Elders is currently debating this request. ' Just seeing her face all naked made me wonder what else she had under those loose flowing robes. Arms? Legs? A writhing, painted torso? I am an unmarried man and have never seen a woman' s body' not even in the heathen overseas broadcasts of the demonic women' s gymnastics, about which horrible things I have heard whispered in the night,'  said one witness, who asked to remain anonymous. ' Yet, from this day forth even my fevered dreams will not be free of my beloved, trouncing trollop, trumpeting the siren song of Satan.'  No fewer than 15 stonings and beheadings are expected as a result of the incident. All those who will be killed are confirmed demons.","local, archive, news, vol 29 issue 06, local"
193,Evolution to Occur Thursday,"Beginning February 22, Human Arms Will Be Slightly Shorter PALO ALTO, CA' In a surprising announcement, scientists at Stanford University revealed yesterday that beginning this Thursday, human arms will become four to six inches shorter. The slight anatomical change, the most significant evolutionary development among homo sapiens in approximately 10,000 years, is expected to occur sometime between 4 and 4:30 a.m. EST. ' For millions of years, we as a species have slowly been moving away from the apes,'  Stanford' s top evolutionary biologist Dr. Maura Creighton said. ' This Thursday represents the next big step in this process. It' s very exciting.'  According to Creighton, humans, with their inactive lifestyles and ever-increasing reliance on technology and machines for physical chores, have been moving toward shorter arms since the Industrial Revolution. ' The average person of today is a far cry from the fit, active human of 100 years ago,'  Creighton said. ' By the year 2050, I expect our arms will be mere four-inch nubs, subtly protruding from our shoulder sockets.'  Evolutionary biologists claim they have seen this change coming, but it was only one of many hypothetical possibilities up until this week. Besides arm length, biologists have theorized that buttocks will become more seat-shaped, male facial hair will disappear altogether, and the human stomach will be replaced by a bird-like gizzard. Thursday' s arm shortening will mark the first significant physical change in humans since 1948' s loss of opposable toes. ' I' ll never forget that day,'  said Frank Costello, 89. ' It was around 6, and I was enjoying a delicious steak dinner with my wife Helen, when all of a sudden, my fork fell out from between my toes. I tried to pick it up again, but no matter how hard I tried I just couldn' t. I had lost all use of my feet, just like that.'  Perhaps more than anyone else, America' s clothing manufacturers expect to benefit greatly from the change in arm length. ' People will need totally new wardrobes,'  Gap spokesperson Diane Schmidt said. ' And thanks to our brand-new line of specially modified button-downs, plain pocket-T' s and 100% wool roll-neck sweaters, Americans will be able to evolve in relaxed, great-fitting style.'  Also excited by the evolution news is America' s freakishly deformed population. ' As a result of my mother' s exposure to the chemical Thalidamide during her pregnancy, I was born with badly shortened limbs, both arms and legs,'  said Harris Lawson, 32, of Scottsdale, AZ. ' Now perhaps I will no longer be shunned wherever I go.'  Experts warn that although slight, the change in arm length will require some getting used to. ' For the next few months, people will be reaching for things and coming up short,'  Baylor University psychology professor Milton Jarmel-son said. ' A can here, a light bulb there. At times, that will undoubtedly get pretty frustrating. But when someone gets angry, they should try to remember that they' re not alone.'

194,Crips Streamline Membership Application Process,"Paperwork, Beatings To Be Reduced 50% LOS ANGELES' In an effort to better serve potential new members, the L.A.-based Crips street gang unveiled a revamped gang application procedure yesterday, one expected to reduce both initiation beatings and paperwork by 50 percent. The new process, which was principally designed by Crips president LaShawn Harris, is scheduled to take effect immediately. ' We are confident that the changes will make becoming a Crip easier and more enjoyable,'  Harris said. ' We simply felt that the old procedure, which involved filling out long, detailed application forms in triplicate; getting the forms stamped by a notary public; and having senior gang members urinate in one' s mouth, was discouraging to many young people interested in being a part of our organization.'  Among the major changes: New members will no longer be required to show ID before selecting a ho from the Crips'  stable of bitches. ' In the past, anyone with less than two years'  membership had to have an active ID card with an up-to-date sticker on the back if they wanted to get freaky with one of the hoes,'  Crips treasurer Trezelle Ivey said. ' Now, all they have to do is give their membership number and initial a sheet.'  Ivey added that when knocking boots, gang members now have the added option of using a special new voucher, which can be re-credited to one' s account if the bitch turns cold and refuses to give it up. Another improvement the Crips have made is greater flexibility in scheduling initiation murders. ' Until now, we pretty much told new members that they would have to go out and kill a Blood at a time that was good for us,'  Crips vice-president Dwayne Henderson said. ' Well, very often that made things difficult for those who had a prior commitment, such as a job or internship. Now, new members can commit their mandatory killings at a time that' s good for them, not us.'  The Crips have also revamped their branding procedure. ' No longer will new members be forcibly held down by four senior Crips as a giant ' C'  is burned into their back,'  Henderson said. ' We now offer frightened new members the option of having a fifth person help restrain them.'  To offset the cost of providing the fifth helper at brandings, however, the gang will no longer offer initiates a free blunt or 40-ounce of St. Ides to numb the pain. So far, reaction to the changes have been largely positive. ' When my older brother joined the Crips in 1991, he had to wait in line for hours,'  new member Keyshon Williams, 14, said. ' But when I joined recently, there was practically no wait at all. I was initiated and beaten in less than 15 minutes. And I was actually doing drive-bys the very next day.'  LAPD officials are impressed by the changes. ' With so many young people today interested in gangbanging, it' s often difficult for popular gangs to process them fast enough,'  Sgt. Jeff Herron said. ' But the Crips are doing a tremendous job accommodating all these kids. And their processing center is now open until 8 p.m. on Thursdays, which helps a lot for those with nine-to-five jobs.'  According to Crip spokesperson Allan ' T. Boz'  Watkins, by 1998 the gang hopes to have all members'  records computerized. ' At the push of a button, we' ll know exactly who' s killed whom, and who has said what about whose mother.'  Despite the application procedure changes, the gang' s resignation procedure will remain the same. According to Harris: ' Those looking to quit will still have to complete resignation forms in duplicate, fill out the Crips exit survey, undergo an exit interview to let management know personally how they felt about their experience with us, and hand in all registered sawed-offs and glocks.'

195,Bronx Zoo Opens New Loitering Teens Exhibit,"The Bronx Zoo, long a trailblazer among the world' s zoological reserves, opened its exciting new Loitering Teens exhibit Saturday to the anticipation of zoogoers nationwide. ' They are fascinating,'  said Ronald Fehgr, 51, a member of the Bronx Zoo Board of Directors and the man who lobbied hardest for the exhibit. ' The public will enjoy watching them hang out and smoke in an attractive natural setting.'  The loitering teen is indigenous to many commercial areas throughout the U.S., but this is the first time they have been captured and put on display. They are recognizable by their large Starter-brand jackets, baggy and ill-fitting pants, sullen attitudes, piercings on their bodies, and red speckled faces. The zoo' s 13 specimens were found in urban areas, caught by big game hunters in a city-wide dragnet. Many were lured into traps with the promise of free cigarettes and spare change. ' The first few groups died in captivity,'  Zoo spokesman Gerard Makhfuio says. ' That' s to be expected, so we weren' t too disappointed.'  The exhibit will eventually consist of a half-block of city-like facade including an arcade, fast-food restaurant and concrete park. For now, though, the loitering teens have been placed in the former kodiak bear holding pen, in a comfortable setting of rocks, caves and small pools of potable water. Plans to place a video arcade game inside the pen as soon as possible have already been approved by the zoo board. ' They appear to be comfortable in the rocky setting, but for the most part they seem to mope around a lot,'  senior zookeeper Bernard Gilks says. ' When the custodians come in to clean their cages, and put on some rock music, they perk up a bit. They definitely respond to music.'  One lesson zoo officials quickly learned was not to introduce parents into the teens'  cages. When this happened, according to one eyewitness, the teens became enraged, ran around the cage, and screamed repeatedly, ' you just don' t understand me,'  at the top of their lungs. Also of concern to zoo officials are the mating rituals of the teens, who appear to be awkward and ill at ease around members of the opposite sex. ' We' re hoping to get them to mate,'  Makhfuio says. ' But as of now, all they appear interested in is shaking zoo patrons down for change and hiding from someone known only as ' Johnny Law.' '  Still, wax statuettes of the teens were a best-seller over the weekend, and there has been talk of opening up a petting area for other humans to interact with them on a limited basis. If visitor numbers continue to run as high as last weekend' s total, the Loitering Teen exhibit could surpass ' Women In Our Midst'  as the largest attraction in San Diego Zoo history.","local, archive, news, vol 29 issue 06, local"

197,'It's Raining Men!',"248 Hot Marine Studs Fall from Sky in Midair Collision, Thrilling Area Women ANNAPOLIS, MD'  The women of the Acme-Temps office pool in West Annapolis were surprised and thrilled yesterday when hundreds of handsome, well-muscled young men poured from the heavens as the result of a horrendous midair collision between two Army aircraft. The C-130 transport planes were each traveling at over 700 miles per hour when their flight paths intersected catastrophically, deluging the ecstatic AcmeTemps typists with an abundance of rug-ged male flesh. ' Hallelujah!'  said Acme employee Judy Steered, 45, as she made her way through the emergency cordons. ' This is the kind of thing you just dream about, sitting behind that Selectric all day.'  Steered had narrowly escaped death only mo-ments earlier when the lithe, strong body of Sgt. James Elkins crashed through the fluorescent lighting, coming to rest across her desk. Her experience was by no means unique: More than half of AcmeTemps'  female staff benefited in a similar fashion. Typing and filing stopped as the playful rioting began, and typists and temp workers raced to be the first with their own soldier. The sudden paperwork stoppage may mean that many local firms will be weeks behind in terms of filing and documentation. And because of the ladies'  reluctance to return what may be for some their first male body, the exact death toll might never be known. ' I can' t believe this really happened to me,'  gushed one pant-suited clerk as she tenderly cradled the corpse of Corporal Gerald Black, a man considered handsome before his 10,000-foot plummet through the atmosphere and explosive entry into the office building. ' Things like this make me believe in fate.'  An Army spokesperson confirmed the incident as the worst air disaster in U.S. military history. United States Armed Forces emergency management teams were on the scene almost instantly and, despite the shortage of body bags and blood plasma, were able to confirm that the secretaries'  wildest dreams had come true. ' Most American troops are polite, well-trained young men in excellent physical condition, and unmarried to boot,'  EMT sergeant June Peirsen said while conducting hasty on-site triage. ' Quite frankly, I' m envious.'  Women who weren' t lucky enough to receive an entire serviceman still found enough to hold their interest. ' Look at this beautiful buff ass,'  manager Lori Deveraux gushed, displaying the severed hindquarters of staff sergeant Caleb Smith. ' There' s a pile of these in the lobby four feet high' and another pile by the restrooms if you favor big, hairy chests.'  ' Look at the size of this bicep!'  shrieked dental technician Nikki Britton, flexing a severed right arm believed to have been torn from PFC Chris Odell. ' It' s even tattooed, with a dagger going through a little heart, and I' m going to have my name added right here.'  The Army stated that it could be weeks before all the carcasses are reassembled, identified, and given a proper burial.","archive, archive, vol 29 issue 05, the onion"
198,Massive Oil Spill Results in Improved Wildlife Viscosity,"NOME, AK' A Castrol Oil supertanker ran aground Monday near Nome, Alaska, spilling more than 51 million gallons of oil into the Bering Strait and greatly improving the viscosity of area marine wildlife. The spill, the world' s largest since the Exxon Valdez ran aground in 1989, has coated over 500,000 birds, fish and seals in quality, high-grade lubricant that will provide valuable protection and keep important animal parts running smooth. Wildlife officials were excited by news of the spill. ' A thick coat of oil should help these animals a lot, especially in the cold weather,'  Tom Wofford of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Depart-ment said. ' Last month alone, we had 200 cases of Northern Cranes suffering from severe thermal breakdown. When temperatures reach 75 degrees below zero, these seals need a good oil like Castrol to keep their wings and other parts loose.'  According to Wofford, the Bering Strait' s extremely active animal population, with its broad hunting and migratory patterns, has long been in need of preventative oil care. ' Today' s wildlife revs at higher r.p.m.' s,'  Wofford said. ' So when you' re a gray seal, and you' re swimming after a fish at over 200 strokes per minute, you can' t afford any friction on your fins or tail. You need a quality motor oil to keep them as loose as possible.'  Especially benefitting from the recent spill is the local salmon population. Several thousand were spotted energetically flipping around in the crude oil, gasping for air from all the playful exertion. Many of them, exhausted, stopped moving altogether. Castrol spokesperson Bob Crutch-field was also pleased with the oil spill. ' For years our products have provided top-notch protection for millions of automobile owners,'  Crutchfield said. ' Now we will be able to provide that same protection for America' s birds and fish.'  For most Arctic-based animals, Crutchfield recommends Castrol Premium. For animals that spend a lot of time near or in the water, such as egrets and halibut, he recommends Castrol Plus, which contains an anti-rust ingredient. Monday' s spill was so successful, plans are already being laid for similar oil leaks around the world. Beginning this spring, massive tankers strategically placed in wildlife-rich areas will be intentionally run aground, covering millions of surrounding flora and fauna in a healthy coat of motor oil. In shoreline areas not rocky enough to rupture metal, oil tankers will be ' pre-cut,'  their hulls sliced just enough to burst open at the slightest contact. In addition to off-shore spills, Castrol officials hope to expand inland, coating rainforests, wetlands and other at-risk ecosystems in a high-grade automotive lubricant. ' Every day, seven more species become extinct in the Amazon rainforest,'  said Marcia Nettles, director of the Rainforest Action Network. ' Perhaps if we stressed proper prevention and maintenance with genuine Castrol-brand products, we could keep these species from dying off so fast.'  According to Wofford, the recent oil spill has had an added benefit, providing the waters of the Bering Strait with an attractive rainbow sheen. ' Before the spill, the water here was pretty much greenish-blue all the time,'  Wofford said. ' Now we' ve got a million different colors. It' s very exciting.'  Wofford added the water also now has ' a super-fun shine, which is far more attractive than the algae and drab-green plant life it replaced.' ","archive, news, vol 29 issue 05, the onion"
199,Crazy Old-Timer Wants to Create 'Master Race',"DUBUQUE, IA' Chalk it up to eccentricity, old age or just plain senility, but area nursing home resident Adolf Hitler is planning to create a ' master race'  of Indo-European Caucasians and eradicate entire races of inferior people! At the ripe old age of 106, this spirited old-timer can barely sit up in his bed without an orderly' s help, but that doesn' t keep him from making big plans. ' My precious Deutchland will rise again,'  Hitler wheezes in his thick German accent. ' The army of the Third Reich will sweep across the land, cleansing away all the sub-human doggerel standing in its path.'  Let' s hope we all have his spunk at 106! Hitler vows that Jews, gypsies, homosexuals, blacks and traitors will all be wiped away in the wake of his powerful army. He says his master race, or as he likes to call them, the ' Aryans,'  will vanquish the impure races and the filth of humanity and establish a ' Third Reich,'  which will rule the world for a thousand years. A thousand years? No disrespect intended, Mr. Hitler, but you' re probably not going to live that long! What does Hitler' s roommate think of all this? Sol Weinman, 102, watches much of what goes on in Hitler' s side of the room. Weinman produces a scratchy whisper with all the strength he can muster. ' Please,'  he says slowly. ' Different room.'  Hitler' s enthusiasm has proven contagious, attracting both volunteer and financial support. From his nursing home room, with the help of others, he sends out letters and pamphlets. Appealing to residents in the area, Hitler hopes to garner enough support to pull off his ambitious plans. ' I am Adolf Hitler,'  one of his pamphlets begins. ' I am alive and well and living in America. Join me, and together we can unite the Aryan race against its enemies. Even now as I write to you, our abominable enemies are spreading their disease throughout the world. Like rats, they have burrowed deep inside our society, insidiously spreading their poison. This scourge must be wiped out.'  Quite the imagination for an old guy' it' s a wonder all Hitler' s plotting doesn' t wipe him out! Local psychologist Lynn Weoskdif says that while many young people create their own ' worlds'  in popular board games like ' Dungeons and Dragons,'  it is not uncommon for the elderly to also enjoy fantasies of empowerment. ' When we grow old, we tend to cling to a moment of great passion in our past as a means to maintain our dwindling self-esteem,'  Weoskdif says. ' Perhaps Mr. Hitler was politically active as a young person and wants to recapture that feeling of excitement.'  Apparently, word of Hitler and his crazy schemes has gotten past nursing home walls. Milt Fryer, leader of a local group called ' White Nation,'  has taken strong notice of the plucky old coot. ' The symbolic leader of our movement is with us,'  Fryer says. ' It is a glorious day for all of us, and the war for America is just the beginning.'  Apparently, Hitler' s spirit is contagious! If we' re not careful, pretty soon we' ll all be talking like this! Though it' s a minor inconvenience for the nursing home staff during feeding and medicine time, Fryer and other fans stand by his bedside all day long, anxiously awaiting his every instruction. And one has to admire old Hitler. At 107, he' s still dreaming of the future. ' We must crush the enemy,'  Hitler coughs to his young supporters. ' Our glorious Luftwaffe, piloted by our finest pure-blooded youth, must rain death upon the half-breeds with whom we share the continent of Europe.'  With that kind of go-go attitude, who knows? Maybe he will live to be 1,000 after all!","local, archive, news, vol 29 issue 05, local"
200,Area Freak Hides In Cave,"Look Away, I Am An Abomination,' He Says Long-missing Bauton resident Richard Milk, a former potter turned freak, returned late Thursday night to stock up on supplies. Milk, 36, has been living in a cave since his self-imposed exile. ' I come in the dead of night to avoid those who would shun me!'  an agitated Milk said. ' I want for nothing save enough supplies so that I need never show my face to humanity again! Don' t look at me! I' m hideous! Hideous, I tell you!'  Milk appeared at Bauton' s Gasss-Up, a convenience store located on Union Street, at approximately 11:30 p.m. He was loaded down with various pelts and dried berries. While on the premises, he gathered as many snack foods, canned products, and olives as he could hold, all the while keeping his head down and ducking into shadows. ' I was sure that he was some pervert,'  clerk Gina Kaliwictz said. ' I was getting ready to call the cops. But when I saw his face, I was stunned. It was not my life that I feared for, but rather for all people should this man be let loose into society.'  When Kaliwictz refused to accept the stack of uncured pelts and berries as payment for Milk' s purchase, Milk ran from the store with tears of rejection streaming down his face. ' My hideous visage and banshee voice should not be experienced by anyone,'  shrieked Milk. ' Go away! Go now or I shall let flow the boiling oil!'  Milk, whose features have been described as ' somewhat unpleasant,'  left his family at age 19 to live in one of the many caves which dot the town' s surrounding hills. There, he has set up a modest living space consisting of a pile of dank rags and a spoon. ' My spoon understands my pain!'  Milk said. ' My spoon is my only friend! I call him Roundy the spoon, and we are friends. Now leave! Leave me to my eternal suffering and misery!'  One person, 8-year-old Bauton resident Amanda Golden, attempted to befriend Milk by taking some fresh baked cookies to his cave. Less than a minute after entering the cave, she emerged screaming, her face contorted with terror. ' Mommy said that there was no such thing as a monster,'  she said with a blanket wrapped around her trembling body. ' Now I know that she lied.'  According to sources close to the family, Golden has been unable to sleep without a light since the incident. Milk' s mother, Anita, was surprised to hear that her son was still alive. ' Richard was always a bright and compassionate boy,'  Anita Milk said. ' He knew better than anyone that he was an abomination, unfit for society. Why he hasn' t killed himself yet is a mystery to me.'  Bauton has contended with freaks in the past. However, since the 1987 repeal of a 100-year-old law permitting the killing of ' those who offend the eye in profound ways,'  Bauton has wrestled with how to deal with them. A town meeting is scheduled for next week, during which community members will decide whether to hunt Milk down and kill him, or to exploit him. If Bauton goes ahead with full-blown exploitation, the most popular plan among townspeople calls for the sealing of Milk' s cave with iron bars. Visitors would then be charged $5 to throw either pies or rocks at his face. Another option is to capture and sell Milk to the circus, which could yield upwards of $500 for the cash-strapped town.","local, archive, news, vol 29 issue 05, local"
201,,"WASHINGTON, D.C.' In an incident under heavy investigation by Secret Service officials, President Clinton was ' tagged'  late yesterday afternoon, spray-painted across the chest by a member of the E. Street Kingz, a notorious D.C. street gang. The latest in a series of graffiti strikes in the ongoing war between the Kingz and their rival gang, the Deth Ro Niggaz, the tagging caused an estimated $350 in damages to Clinton' s suit and officially marked the President as Kingz' s ' turf.'  ' We are shocked and disturbed by this serious breach of presidential security,'  White House chief of security Alan Watkins said. ' We are taking every possible step to protect the President in the future, including coating him with a paint-resistant shellac.'  The incident marked the first crime committed against a President since Ronald Reagan was raped by David James Pelphrey in 1986. According to reports, shortly after 3 p.m., an unidentified member of the E. Street Kingz snuck past White House guards and spray-painted a red, backwards ' ESK' ' the gang' s symbol' across Clinton' s chest. The unidentified gang member escaped through the South Lawn gate by telling guards that he was Secretary of State Warren Christopher. According to Washington-area gang experts, with the tagging, President Clinton has officially become part of the Kingz' s territory. ' This is a major coup for the Kingz,'  said Jerry Lloyd, head of the D.C. Task Force on Gang Activities. ' Having the most powerful man in the world in their corner should help the Kingz tremendously in their ongoing battle with the Deth Ro Niggaz.'  Lloyd expects the gang to start Clinton off as a ' runner,'  relaying drugs and running errands for senior Kingz members, such as G. Dogg and Shorty Mack. ' Clinton will certainly be doing some drug smuggling,'  Lloyd said. ' But mostly he will be making runs to the corner store, purchasing snack chips and malt liquor for the fellas.'  When informed of the Kingz' s plans for him, Clinton stood firm. ' I refuse to give props to these men,'  he said. ' I am the President of the United States, and I will not be played.'  Clinton added he was ' not fronting.'  Clinton, who rushed over to the Capitol shortly after the incident, still had traces of red paint on his chin and right cheek. ' I am saddened and disappointed by the senseless vandalism of my neck, face and chest,'  Clinton said yesterday afternoon. According to FBI officials, if caught, the offending gang member would be forced to clean the president from head to toe. ' Vandalism of this sort is no joke,'  FBI spokesman Louis Freeh said. ' When we catch this kid, he' s going to hose the president off and scrub him down good with a stiff brush. I don' t want to see a single spot left on Clinton.'  Freeh added that if the Kingz are not stopped, they may attempt to spray- paint a larger mural on Clinton. ' This time, they didn' t get a chance to do much more than a quick tag,'  Freeh said. ' But now that they' ve had a taste of success, and true to the graffiti artist' s credo, I certainly wouldn' t rule out the possibility of them coming back for a much bigger, full-body mural. A colorful scene of Kingz greatness.'  To counter the Kingz move, the Deth Ro Niggaz have set their sights on Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who will visit Washington this summer. ' If the Niggaz could somehow tag Xiaoping, they would virtually control D.C.,'  Lloyd said. ' There' s no other gang in the city that would have 1.3 billion disciplined Asian foot soldiers at their disposal. They would be very difficult to stop.'

202,,"GRZNY (AP)' A group of Serbian rape camp prisoners, held captive and brutally victimized by the Serbs since early 1994, fell victim again yesterday, this time to Dick Clark' s outrageous TV' s Bloopers and Prac-tical Jokes. An estimated two dozen prisoners were duped by the Bloopers crew, who for years have delighted American TV audiences with their outrageous, perfectly laid pranks. First to be tricked by the Bloopers gang was prisoner Katrina Milosevic, a Tuzla-area seamstress. As Bloopers spokesperson Teri Norris explained: ' We had Jack Haynes, a Hollywood actor, dress up as a U.N. soldier and pretend to liberate the camp. He went over to Katrina and about a dozen other prisoners' all of whom were also hired actors' and announced they were free. They all started celebrating and jumping up and down, including Katrina. She was completely fooled!'  ' I truly thought I was free from this horrible place,'  Milosevic said. ' When I found out I was on TV' s Bloopers and Practical Jokes, it was like dying a thousand deaths.'  The Serbian Bloopers, scheduled to air this Friday at 8 p.m. on NBC, is expected to be the most successful international episode of the show since Nov. 7, 1993, when fake relief packs were airdropped over Rwanda. ' The packs were labeled ' Delicious Filling Food' ,'  Norris said. ' But when they cut them open, it was just sand. You should have seen their reaction!'  Also duped yesterday was Rodja Ilsovic, 34, a dishwasher from Grzny. Ilsovic was escorted by her boyfriend, Gheorghe Duresan, to a fake Italian restaurant, carefully constructed by the Bloopers crew. ' We sat down to eat, and all of a sudden, these bombs went off and the restaurant walls started exploding in flames,'  Duresan said. ' We all screamed, ' It' s a Serb attack! We are going to die!'  Rodja fell for it completely and started crying and screaming herself.'  When told she was on TV' s Bloopers and Practical Jokes, Ilsovic cried even harder. ' I guess she was overwhelmed at the thought of being on national TV,'  Duresan said. According to Norris, the Serbian camp is an ideal place for the show' s famous brand of trickery. ' These prisoners are perfect. For years they have desperately hoped that they will be saved,'  Norris said. ' As such, they' re susceptible to being duped, often with hilarious results.'  Among the most successful pranks was one pulled off against Gorazde' s Krizia Sabonis. A mother of five, Sabonis was tricked by a ' Serb official'  (in reality a paid actor) into thinking her two youngest children were killed when their elementary school was firebombed. ' They had a fake telegram and everything,'  Sabonis said. ' I really thought Toni and Mlodan were dead.'  According to observers, the prisoners were ill-prepared for such wild scheming. ' For years, these prisoners have been brutally tortured mentally and physically, relentlessly preyed upon by their captors,'  New York Times Bosnia correspondent Roger Moresay said. ' But that can' t possibly compare to being the prey of the out-of-this-world pranks of TV' s Bloopers and Practical Jokes.' ","world, archive, news, vol 29 issue 05, the onion"
203,Jews Ordered Back to Egypt for Pyramid Duty,"CAIRO' Citing thousands of years of grueling wear and tear on its famed pyramids, the Egyptian government recalled the Jewish people yesterday. The Jews, though currently spread throughout the world in a global Diaspora, are in the process of returning to Egypt to repair damages the Pyramids have suffered over the last 4,000 years. ' They did a superb job the first time around, and we expect the same level of high-quality craftsmanship now,'  said Egyptian Minister of Tourism Fekesh Sabah, a top assistant to the Pharaoh. ' They are a highly skilled people.'  The Jews were urged to return by a forceful letter sent to every Jewish household in the world. The letter strongly suggested they return, if they knew what was good for them. ' The language of the letter seemed very sincere and forthright,'  Detroit marketing analyst Roger Fine said. ' It just came off like we really should go back.'  Fine is one of millions of Jews, or ' Hebrewites,'  who hastily quit his job, sold all his worldly possessions, and boarded one of the thousands of charter jets heading to Cairo International Airport. Jews are massing in the Egyptian capital, where they are being sent out in labor teams of 600 to replace stones, repair crumbling walls and reinstall statuary to the sun god Ra. They will do this not only for the rest of their lives, but also for the lives of their children and their children' s children. ' This is very hard work,'  said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, an accountant from Cherry Hill, NJ. ' I do not enjoy this at all.'  Added Rachel Cohen of Los Angeles: ' My job as a record label publicist has very little to do with hauling enormous, 40-ton sandstone slabs through the desert.'  To repair the pyramids, the Jews will employ many of the same effective building techniques used during their first construction, including the lever and the pulley. ' We have found that utilizing these techniques makes lifting the rocks up the 75-degree incline that much easier,'  Project Coordinator Nassar Achbad said. ' Doing it the old way, by hand alone, it would take over 500 years to complete the work. Now, it won' t take more than two or three centuries, if that.'  The Jews first built the pyramids between 2686 and 2181 B.C. under enslavement by numerous pharaohs. Only after Moses, a prophet of the lord Yahweh, rose up to lead them were they able to escape into the desert and relocate to the promised land of Israel. According to published reports, the Jews spent 40 years in the desert subsisting on an unleavened bread product and water, which was found by smashing magical scepters into rocks. Once again, the Jewish people are hoping for a prophet to rise up from among the people and lead them back to freedom. This prophet may be Florida lawyer Barry Stern, whose successful defense firm in Fort Lauderdale has freed many white and blue collar workers from potential incarceration. ' The climate here is similar to Florida, a dry heat which is more bearable than the hu-midity of say, the Ama-zon rainforest. But I don' t enjoy be-ing whipped by my overseers,'  Stern said. ' If this continues, litigation may be pending.'  Though they do not fear legal recourse, Egyp-tian officials are hopeful that the Jews won' t pull out in a similar manner as last time, visiting a host of deadly plagues on the Egyptian people. This culminated in the parting of the Red Sea, which drowned over half the Egyptian army. Said Sabah: ' I hope they don' t do that again.' ","world, archive, news, vol 29 issue 04, the onion"
204,Fanzine Marred by Typo,"BERKELEY, CA' A clear typographical error was discovered yesterday in the latest issue of MangaMash, a fanzine devoted to hardcore Japanese speed metal bands and Sanrio/Hello Kitty novelty kitsch products. The error, an obvious incorrect usage of ' your'  instead of ' you' re,'  shocked and disappointed MangaMash' s estimated dozen readers, who for over 11 months and three issues have come to value the fanzine' s commitment to journalistic excellence. ' I guess I just missed that one,'  said editor/writer/publisher Dave Pelks, 20, who usually tries to read over the paper before taking it to the copy shop. ' It' s ' you' re'  and not ' your' ? I always mess that up.'  The typo marks the first error for MangaMash since last year' s April/November issue, in which ' New York'  was spelled ' New Yrrok.'  ' That wasn' t like a real mistake,'  said Pelks, defending the earlier error. ' That time I just totally typed it wrong by accident. I know how to spell New York.'  Pelks maintains it was late at the time, and he was ' really tired.'  To prevent future errors, Pelks has made significant overhauls in the fanzine' s complex editorial process. ' I think from now on I' m gonna have my sister Anne look it over before I make any copies,'  he said. ' She' s only 15, but she' s really good at spelling and writing. She' s like the brain of the family.'  As an added safety check, if Anne is unavailable for editing, Pelks says he will ask his mother for help. Because of the typo, future expansion plans have been put on hold. ' I was hoping do a color cover for the next issue,'  Pelks said. ' Actually, not in color, but on color paper. It was gonna be a big picture of Hello Kitty fighting Ga-mera on green paper. That would' ve been so cool.'  According to in-dustry insiders, the mistake puts the fanzine' s rock-solid reputation in jeopardy. ' This is a serious error,'  Doubleday vice' president Mar-garet Ferber said. ' It' s Manga-Mash' s most significant mistake since two issues ago, when Pelks stapled all the cover pages on upside-down.'  ' I totally wasn' t paying attention,'  Pelks said of the incident. Collectors estimate the value of the upside-down cover issue at zero dollars. Despite the most recent slip-up, Manga-Mash' s two distributors have vowed to stand behind the embattled fanzine. ' MangaMash provides the best coverage around of Japancore bands like HappyGinzaPoo and Shoko Ono,'  said Pat Kwiatkowski, owner of Crush Records, a local record store specializing in used LPs and hard-to-find imports. ' Their recent feature on KyotoFunFun' s tour of New Zealand was outstanding.'  Paul Scobee, manager of the Stop-N-Pop, also stood by the fanzine. ' A few months ago, this kid asked me if he could leave a few copies of his magazine thing by the door,'  Scobee said. ' I told him yeah, as long as they don' t block the entrance. So far, it' s been okay.'  The fanzine' s most recent error has not surprised grammar experts, who say it ranks among the most frequently made mistakes. ' A lot of people confuse ' your'  and ' you' re,' '  The New York Times'  William Safire said. ' If you are unsure, I recommend you actually spell out ' you are,'  and then see if it makes sense in context.' ","local, archive, news, vol 29 issue 04, local"
205,New Government Shutdown Caused by Bat in Capitol,"The federal government shut down again on Monday at 5 p.m. when a bat was spotted flying around the inside of the U.S. Capitol building. Legislators, fearing they may be attacked by the bat, have suspended all governmental activity until it flies out a window, is shooed away by someone with a broom, or is ultimately done away with by U.S. pest control experts. ' The bat gave us a good scare,'  said Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-KS), who is waiting on the steps of the Capitol with other lawmakers until the bat is removed. ' There' s no way in hell I' m going back in there,'  he said. ' He might get into my hair.'  House Speaker Newt Gingrich agreed that there is ' no chance'  Congress will begin working on vital issues such as rebuilding our infrastructure and cutting taxes for working families until the bat has flown away. According to Gingrich, ' Is he still in there? Somebody go see if he' s still in there.'  Added Senator Russ Feingold (D-WI): ' Bats bite, don' t they?'  The bat was discovered by Senator George Klwertyuo (D-VT), who happened to be looking up during a debate over a budget appropriations bill. He noticed the pint-sized beast flying in a swooping, figure-eight pattern, seeming to be headed straight for a wall or ceiling, then veering away at just the last moment in an eerily unpredictable fashion. Klwertyuo screamed, ' Bat!'  and pointed upward. All heads craned to see the flying vermin. The debate instantly halted as all eyes followed the bat flapping back and forth aloft in the legislative chamber. Occasionally a few gasps were uttered as the bat swerved frightfully close to ground level and senators instinctively shielded their heads and faces from potential attack. Senator Milton Hershsod (R-MO), a decorated World War II combat veteran, noticed that the bat had stopped flying around and was perched on an out-of-the-way banister. The senator came at the bat with a paper bag, attempting to capture it and set it loose. But, according to witnesses, the bat emitted a terrifying shriek, causing Hershsod to run away and dive under a nearby table. Legislators, gripped by panic, sprinted out the door, screeching in a manner similar to young children. Pest control units scrambled from nearby Quantico, VA, and hope to have the bat safely removed from the chamber by mid-February. The bat represents the biggest pest-related government shutdown since late last month, when a silverfish was spotted on the wainscoting of the Senate Finance Committee offices.","politics, archive, news, vol 29 issue 04, politics"
206,"First National Bank Announces: 'Suckers, We're Keeping All the Money'","BOSTON' The First National Bank of Boston, the nation' s largest commercial bank, announced yesterday that it will no longer hold on to its customers'  money and instead keep it all for itself to use in any way it pleases. Bank officials cited the expense of several ambitious projects, including the construction of an immense corporate palace, as cause for the policy change. ' Possession is nine-tenths of the law, so it is with the law on our side that I say to all First National customers, you are shit out of luck,'  CEO J. Ephraim Gunderloy said at a press conference. Added Vice President of Sales and Marketing Theobald T. Worthington: ' An internationally renowned financial giant like First National has far more important uses for this money than do our small-time accountholders, many of whom live paycheck to paycheck, occasionally withdrawing a few dollars to pay their rent or buy corn dogs.'  According to the bank' s statement, merely protecting the money of commoners was a short-sighted and unprofitable goal. The paltry interest earned on accounts and even on high-rate loans was nothing compared to the outright liquidation of all capital held in the bank. ' The numbers just made sense for us,'  Worthington said. ' We add up all of our fees and service charges and it still amounts to nothing in relation to the gross capital in the bank proper. I mean, this is a pretty big bank, and not to give away too much, but all told, we' ve got billions of dollars just sitting there for the taking.'  Customers'  money will now largely go to fund the construction of a new state-of-the-art First National headquarters, made entirely of ivory, bank spokespeople said. Precious stones will be set into the walls, and all light fixtures will be made of solid gold. Because of the building' s enormous size, officials hope to interconnect various departments with an elaborate system of canals and viaducts, each flowing with molten gold and cruised by luxurious onyx pleasure barges. ' Our executives will be distinguished by the height of the ostrich they ride,'  Gunderloy said. ' The taller the ostrich, the more significant the job title. My ostrich, for example, will measure eight feet, three and one-half inches, while Mr. Worthington' s will be only six feet, two and three-quarters.'  Junior executives, meanwhile, will have to content themselves with emus. Other uses for the money include a First National corporate space shuttle, weekly bonfires of bills with bent corners, and 800 Faberge eggs for First National executives to throw at each other for no reason at all. First National informed its customers of the change in their account status by enclosing a form letter in lieu of January account statements. The note read, ' Due to a shift in corporate policy, we are keeping all money currently held at First National. Your First National account is officially closed. We have eliminated our customer service department, so, we will be unable to answer any questions about this change. Thank you for banking with us.'  Many accountholders expressed disappointment in having all their money taken by the bank. ' Not only is my retirement fund gone, but also my children' s college money,'  First National customer Gerard Falstaff said. ' Now I will have to sell at least two of my children into indentured servitude and will either have to start saving from scratch again or just kill myself. This is pretty disappointing.'

208,,"Clinton: ' We need another Vietnam'  President Clinton an-nounced today that after 20 years and a slow, painful healing process, the U.S. will again invade Vietnam. ' For a long time, we have said we don' t need another Viet-nam,'  Clinton told a joint session of Congress. ' But now, more than ever, America needs to be divided. We need another Vietnam.'  American ground troops will be flown in via helicopters to ransack villages. Unrelenting napalm bombing missions will obliterate thousands of acres of Vietnamese farmland and rain forest. Clinton also plans to use chemical weapons like Agent Orange to inflict long-term physical damage to Vietnamese civilians and American soldiers alike. ' Furthermore,'  Clinton said, ' I believe the time is right for American soldiers to rape and kill more Vietnamese women and children.'  Clinton urged our nation' s young people to do their part by organizing protests against the war. ' It is up to the younger generation to put a wedge in our national pride, and make the soldiers doubt their mission overseas,'  he said. ' I want to see flags burning on our campuses.'  The president promised to order National Guardsmen to shoot students who engage in protest of any kind. Eighteen to 30-year-olds are being conscripted by the thousands at local armed forces recruiting offices. But many eligible men are burning their draft cards and escaping to universities, seminaries or Canada. Clinton applauded these men for helping create a class war. ' With your help,'  he said, ' America can be split into the haves and the have-nots. Those with the means will escape the war, while those without will be sent overseas to die.'  Clinton said he hopes the majority of those who die are impoverished blacks, or at the very least, poor white southerners. Clinton called on the Vietnamese to take as many U.S. prisoners as they can. ' Only then can we, as a nation, be truly demoralized by war,'  Clinton said. The president looks forward to hearing tales many years from now of brutal, unspeakable torture, and of the dehumanization of U.S. soldiers in POW camps. He promised that his administration would do very little to return the soldiers when the war is over. The president promised that soldiers will be heckled and spat upon when returning to America after the war. ' I myself will stand by the transport planes when our soldiers come back, and I' ll yell, ' Babykiller!' '  Clinton urged soldiers to impregnate Vietnamese women during the war so their half-Vietnamese children will be shunned from birth as Yankee-blooded freaks. ' And in many years,'  Clinton said, ' when those children come here to find their fathers, we will stand united and call them freaks, and send them back.'  Clinton said he hopes to see news footage even more disturbing than the famous film of the Vietnamese youth being shot in the head at point-blank range by a laughing U.S. general. ' And that picture of the naked Vietnamese girl running through the streets as her village burns behind her. I want to see more pictures like that one.'  The war will be fought half-heartedly until January 2000.","archive, archive, vol 29 issue 03, the onion"
209,Vietnam Vets Admit War Wasn't That Bad,"After more than two decades of describing the Vietnam War as a ' living hell,'  and an ' endless, indescribable horror beyond all words,'  America' s Vietnam veterans finally admitted yesterday that the war was, in fact, ' not that bad.'  ' Contrary to what we have said all these years,'  National Viet-nam Vet-erans Asso' c-ia-tion president Charles Murphy said, ' Vietnam simply was not that bad. In fact, it was quite enjoyable. We really are a big bunch of babies.'  Following the NVVA announcement, veterans across America acknowledged the war' s positives. ' The jungle battles with the Vietcong were the best part,'  said Walter Kinchen, 45, who served three tours from 1969 to 1971. ' A lot of times, you' d look the enemy in the eye, and instead of killing each other, you' d exchange phone numbers and become friends. They' d show us their hidden forts, and we' d invite them back to our bases to check out imported American amenities like name-brand cigarettes and booze.'  Kinchen said he also picked up a serious heroin addiction in Vietnam, a habit he still enjoys to this day. ' There' s no natural high that can match it,'  he said. ' Not even love.'  David Peters, a Houston businessman, was stationed near the village of Nhat Than from 1971-3. ' I' m just glad the war wasn' t like it was in Apocalypse Now or Platoon,'  Peters said. ' That would' ve been really bad. Operation Dumbo Drop and a little bit of Good Morning Vietnam is a little more true to our experiences.'  Added Peters: ' The thing is, everybody talks about the piles of dead bodies rotting in the fields. But no one ever talks about the cotton candy and carnivals.'  In his announcement, Veterans Association president Murphy also admitted that, contrary to what veterans have claimed until now, the Vietnam experience is not something beyond the average civilian' s comprehension. ' For so long, we' ve told people, ' If you weren' t there, you wouldn' t understand it,' '  Murphy said. ' Well that' s simply not true. If you weren' t there, you could easily open up a book and get a very good sense of what it was like. There are plenty of books out there with detailed descriptions and vivid color pictures. You certainly didn' t need to actually be there to get a feel for it.'  Kevin Stallings, a Boston-area accountant who was stationed near Le Thuy from 1972-3, remembers many good times. ' A lot of times, in between fighting, we' d go down to this great seafood restaurant in Da Nang and just hang out and drink for hours,'  Stallings said. ' Then we' d usually find some beautiful local girls and take them back to a motel and have sex with them. And often they would become our beloved wives.'  Stallings has three beautiful children in Southeast Asia thanks to his exciting war-time sexual exploits. Veteran John Randolph, who as a member of the 56th Delta Division was badly injured by enemy fire during a raid on Haiphong, said that although he has had numerous recurring nightmares over the past 20 years, they have been largely unrelated to the war. ' There' s this really bad one where I' m back in college, and I' m taking a huge calculus final, but I don' t know any of the stuff because I forgot to go to class all semester,'  Randolph said. ' God, it seemed so real, it was frightening.' ","archive, archive, vol 29 issue 03, the onion"
210,Inner-City High School Installs Ticking Time Bomb As Living Metaphor,"CHICAGO' An armed bomb carrying enough C-4 plastic explosive to create a crater the size of one city block has been installed somewhere in George Washington Carver High School on the south side of Chicago. School officials proudly announced the installation of the bomb at a board meeting Monday. ' For years I' ve been telling the newspaper and television reporters that our public schools are a ticking time bomb,'  Carver High principal Hal Fraklski said. ' Now I can point to an actual bomb instead of using a tired metaphor that appears to have lost its effect.'  ' The alarming fact is that a typical student here,'  according to Fraklski, ' is pregnant, in a gang, selling crack, and getting a D- average. Such a student is destined to explode, so to speak, be it to police, drugs, or gang violence. This actual, working time bomb illustrates that fact much better than a mere rhetorical device.'  Added Illinois' s Secretary of Education Milton Hekilj: ' We' ve always known that our schools were a ticking time bomb. And while we' ve never known how to solve the problem, we' ve always known that ' ticking time bomb'  was the perfect metaphor for it. I commend the administration of Carver High School for making that metaphor a tangible reality.'  Funds for the installation of the bomb were diverted from school tutoring and midnight basketball programs. Fraklski said such programs only gave students a false sense of hope, when in reality their futures are horribly bleak. ' We believe building a bomb and putting all of our lives in imminent danger is a much better use for the money,'  Fraklski said. School officials would not reveal the time of the bomb' s eventual explosion. ' The blast of this bomb, whenever it goes off, will blow all 2,200 of our students, faculty and staff into bloody bits, and will reduce the building to a pile of rubble,'  Fraklski said. ' We feel that this sense of uncertainty is an important part of the message.'  Teachers, staff and administrators at the school are now in just as much danger from the bomb as the students. But, according to Fraklski, since one in five teachers at Carver is routinely hospitalized or killed by students, such odds are true to the metaphor. And so far, the metaphor is working. When asked how the ticking time bomb made them feel, 94 percent of Carver High students and teachers answered ' very terrified'  or ' panicked.'  As one teacher commented, ' The feeling of terror I used to have for these students and this prison-like school environment is very similar to the feeling of terror I now have from the bomb.'  ' We' re very proud of that,'  Fraklski commented. ' That means the meta-phor is right on the money.'  The bomb is installed deep within the bowels of the school' s furnace room, yet a special microphone hook-up amplifies its ominous ticking over the school' s PA system, echoing throughout the hallways and classrooms day and night as a constant reminder of the staff and students'  imminent doom. Carver parents have vehemently opposed the bomb, but Fraklski has stood his ground. ' Parents were never too concerned when their children' s lives were just a metaphorical ticking time bomb, but now that they' re in danger of being blown up by a real time bomb, suddenly there' s great concern. Well, that hypocrisy no longer flies at Carver.'  When parents pressured the administration to simply change the metaphor instead of activating a real bomb, Fraklski refused, saying similes, hyperbole, alliteration, clichÃ©s and many other forms of description had been tried, and none has the same power as metaphor. ' We could use a simile and say, ' Our schools are like prisons without guards.'  It' s okay, but not as good as ' ticking time bomb.'  We could use hyperbole and say, ' Our schools are filled with crime all hours of the day.'  Not good either. Nothing has the punch of ' Our schools are a ticking time bomb.' '  The Chicago Tribune contributed to this story.","archive, archive, vol 29 issue 03, the onion"
211,Saturday Looks Terrible for Busy Executive,"CLEARWATER, FL (AP)' Ac-cording to a published report, this coming Saturday, which was expected to look good, now looks terrible for area resident Walter Russell. A marketing executive with the firm of LaMont, Holland & Dozier, the 38-year-old Russell was expected to be free some of the day, but will in reality be extremely busy from early morning until late evening, his time occupied with important business-related matters. ' Saturday' s terrible for me,'  Russell said to friend Jack Shores when asked if he was interested in playing golf that afternoon. ' I' ve still got to figure out the preliminary numbers on the Jenn-Air account before the proposal Monday, and I haven' t even seen the darn strategy report.'  Shores, a fellow marketing executive, expressed disappointment over Russell' s unavailability for golfing. ' I was really looking forward to playing a round with Walter,'  Shores said. ' He' s the only one in the office I can actually beat.'  Shores then chuckled and made several more humorous remarks about his friend' s questionable golf skills. Also disappointed with Russell' s busy Saturday schedule is mistress Diane Kane, 31, with whom the married Russell has been having an affair for nearly four years. ' We were supposed to go out to dinner, and then take a late-night cruise,'  Kane said. ' I was even going to call him by his pet name, ' Waltie,'  which drives him crazy.'  ' I' m sorry baby,'  Russell told Kane late last night via phone. ' I' m just slammed tomorrow. I promise I' ll make it up to you soon.'  Russell then added he would ' really make it up to her,'  if she knew what he meant. This Saturday will mark the third terrible one this month for Russell, who last weekend had to pass on lunch with his wife to finish outlining final budget initiatives for the Mopar Auto Parts account. Experts are not surprised Russell is so busy Saturday. ' Unlike your average auto mechanic or schoolteacher, important marketing executives often must sacrifice weekends,'  Professor James J. Dilweg of Pennsylvania' s Wharton School of Business said. ' Clearly, Walter Russell understands that to stay on top in a competitive, ever-changing business environment, one must give 110 percent. It is such passion for perfection that defines a winner.'  There is an outside shot Saturday will be okay, if Russell can get a solid enough draft of the report done by mid-afternoon. If that happens, he will try to catch the second half of his son' s youth league basketball game before stopping at a client' s early evening cocktail party. He also has been putting off a tune-up for his 1993 Lexus, which at 30,000 miles is starting to give him the type of problems he thought he could avoid by purchasing a $44,000 car.","business, archive, news, vol 29 issue 03, the onion"
212,Middle-Class Suburbanites Fail to See Irony in Their Lives,"Princeton University' s renowned Institute for Advanced Studies revealed yesterday that the middle class, known to French social theorists as the ' petit-bourgeoisie,'  failed in over 98 percent of measured cases to notice the inherent irony in their lives. Though their very existences are riddled with the exact opposites of intended meanings that define irony as we know it, the middle class roundly failed to notice it in a barrage of tests conducted over the past six months by IAS. ' There are countless examples of irony evident in the lives of suburban consumerism-based nuclear families,'  Institute spokesperson Jody Clewes said. ' These ironies, however, are totally lost on the fatuous, unthinking middle class.'  The IAS released over 75 sample questions and answers to demonstrate its findings, ranging from irony evident in social and political agendas, all the way to personal lifestyle choices. Most striking was the middle class' s predominant self-definition as ' socially liberal,'  with regard to equal civil rights and fair treatment for society' s impoverished. This stood in marked contrast to the middle class' s recent trend toward gated, exclusive communities as well as voting for lower property taxes in high-income areas and higher taxes for those living in low-income communities with racially exclusive public schools. Of those polled, 100 percent saw no irony in this. Similarly, the suburbanites were asked if the frequently cited justification of ' wanting to provide my children with a better life'  stood in contrast to working seven days a week to accumulate money. Despite the ever-widening gap between parents and children, and the skyrocketing divorce rate resultant from a lifestyle focused not on family but on careers, all those polled responded, ' I have no idea what you' re talking about.'  As for middle-class suburban lifestyle, there was a similar lack of ' irony recognition'  among the respondents. When quizzed about the familiar practice of ' saving money'  by purchasing retail items ' on sale,'  when the items are not needed even under non-sale conditions, only one of the 68 housewives polled reported noticing slight irony. It was later confirmed that the woman had recently been ' chewed out'  by her husband for spending too much on extravagant, fashionable hats. ' What we' re seeing here,'  UCLA sociologist T. Hubbard Meyer said, ' is that these people sincerely do not see how absurdly comic and borderline pathetic their lives are. Of course, as part of academe, I live on campus and do not have to deal with such societal trifles.'  Middle-class Americans also failed to see the irony in avoiding physical activity by driving everywhere and using elevators instead of stairs, and then joining an expensive health club. The study also queried the logic of drinking diet soda for health reasons, despite the fact that soda is universally defined as a non-healthy ' sweet,'  with ' diet'  merely representing a lower-calorie version of soda with no inherent nutritional value. With regard to pet ownership, the middle class frequently spends hundreds if not thousands of dollars on purebred animals, when healthy, free pets are available at most pounds and humane societies. When approached with this irony, respondents answered with a universal, ' Duh?'  Two rare exceptions in the study were a pair of middle-management employees in their 50s who had suffered psychological breakdowns and were hospitalized after bungled suicide attempts. Their answers noted high degrees of irony in all aspects of their lives, though each survey they submitted included a note from their wives asking, ' Please, pay no attention to my husband, he is not well.'  One respondent, when interviewed for this story, was more than willing to share his take on the survey. ' IronyE€¦ Now let' s see, I seem to recall something about the importance of not mistaking irony for sarcasm in an essay in the NYROB I read recently,'  Gus Freen, 51, said. ' If you' ll have a seat, I' m sure I can dig it up in the library. Irony, was it? Here, would you like a gin and tonic while you wait? I see you' ve noticed my Civil War Memorial Chess Set. Well, the Franklin Mint is known for its exquisite, hand-crafted workmanship.'

213,NASA Nears Completion of $80 Trillion Earth Sock,"Amid much fanfare, NASA officials unveiled the first satellite photos of the nearly completed Earth Sock yesterday at Cape Canaveral. The mood among attending scientists, who have spent the last quarter century working on the project, was one of deep joy, as the result of the ambitious $80 trillion project was finally in sight. ' The now-depleted world econ-omies can rest assured that the $80 trillion price tag will buy a lot of snug-fitting comfort and support,'  Project Earth Sock coordinator Noam Gekhend said. Officials credit the Sock' s completion to the unprecedented international cooperation the project inspired, including astronauts and knitters from over 60 nations. Scores of sock construction teams, both aground and in space, maneuvered fleets of Darning Convoys and Knitting Shuttles in complex flying patterns to weave the freight-train-sized strands of cotton fiber into the 90,000 mile-long Sock. The Earth Sock is the largest man-made structure ever built, dwarfing its nearest competitor, the Great Wall of China, by a factor of two million. It is also cushiony and 100 percent cotton, which means it' s breathable. NASA scientists ex-plained that the Earth Sock will provide the Earth with much-needed protection against chafing and discomfort as the planet is propelled around the sun at 1,800 miles per hour. ' Imagine walking 1,800 miles an hour in the minus 260-degree cold of outer space without socks on,'  Gekhend said. ' To do so would be foolhardy. This is what our planet must do every day. Finally, we have done something to protect her.'  International support for the Sock has been overwhelming. ' As a nation, as a planet, we can all be very proud of this sock,'  President Clinton said. He and the leaders of all 178 nations on earth signed a world resolution proclaiming the completion date, January 1, 1997, ' Sock Day.'  Singing sensation Neil Diamond has soared to the top of the adult contemporary music charts with a tribute song to the Earth Sock: Earth Sock / Mighty Earth Sock! / You' re in outer space / With you we can win this crazy race / And wherever you go / We will go with you / In our minds / In our hearts / And in our dreams. Despite the project' s widespread popularity, some naysayers fault the Sock for being a meaningless make-work project that will devastate the world economy and destroy its delicate ecosystems. Another drawback of the Sock has been the obliteration of the Southern Hemisphere, smothered under the enormous pressure of the snug-fitting sock. The continents of Africa, Australia and South America now exist only in white cotton relief, their citizens unable to stand up or breathe, inexorably pushed downward by the enormous Earth Sock. ' My family and my farm, everything I had, was crushed under the Sock,'  said Pasqual Perquoyez, a Peruvian farmer. ' Why was my country forced into poverty to pay for this Sock?'  A lucky few, such as Perquoyez, have managed to squirm out of the Earth Sock through periodic gaps in the breathable, double-knit fabric. But life for such survivors is hard. Their world is an endless white cotton hellscape, the ghostly shapes of buried cities, mountains and loved ones underfoot. ' The destruction of the Southern Hemisphere was unfortunate,'  Earth Sock project coordinator Gekhend said. ' But realize that the loss of half the planet' s population is well offset by the Sock' s cushiony comfort and at-trac-tive ' crew'  style.'  Gekhend as-sured the world community that no nations of im-port were smothered by the Earth Sock, only minor Southern Hemi-sphere countries like Uruguay, Na-mibia and New Zealand. Scientists also warn that the tip of the sock may come dangerously close to the sun' s corona at the vernal equinox (when the earth is closest to the sun), which may cause the dry fabric to catch ablaze. ' Such a fire would quickly engulf the sock and light up the entire planet Earth like a roman candle in a matter of seconds, reducing every plant, animal and mineral into white hot ash, and cause the planet to break up into a fine dust and dissipate into outer space,'  Gekhend said. ' We' ll know for sure by late Feb-ruary.'  Despite its stag-gering scale, the Earth Sock is only the beginning. ' It is merely a precursor to the Earth Shoe, which we will begin constructing in 2002,'  Gekhend said. Coordinators say the Shoe project will commence once the Earth Sock is pulled up over the entire Earth surface, allowing for an easy and comfortable fit in the shoe.","archive, archive, vol 29 issue 02, the onion"
214,Corporate Merger Results in Global Headshop Conglomerate,"AUSTIN, TX' Since the 1970s, ' Bong on a Drum'  and ' Party Hopper'  have been competitors, offering high-quality decorative smoking pipes, tie-dyed T-shirts and multi-purpose nitrous-oxide dispensers. This week, they will merge, an action that could result in a global conglomerate offering franchises in hundreds of world markets, a listing on the New York Stock Exchange, and salaries in the tens of millions for its two CEOs. ' Yeah, we decided to go into business together because I got this problem getting up in the morning,'  Selena Jones, CEO of Party Hoppers, said. ' I almost never open my store before 1 p.m.'  Jones and Bong on a Drum owner, ' Tobe,'  had planned to get together earlier this week with a group of Wall Street investors to discuss their venture, but Tobe had not shown up for the meeting, and failed to call Jones beforehand. ' That' s cool,'  Jones said. ' Because I was completely out of it, and nobody else showed.'  London Financial Times reporter Berhard L. Timmons has monitored the efforts of the two shop owners closely. ' The floor of the Board of Trade is abuzz with talk of Jones and Tobe' s plan,'  he said. ' Hand-tooled pipe and incense-holder futures are historically skittish in the crucial first quarter' this could be the move that sends them through the roof.'  Jones and Tobe have missed the last three weeks of trading sessions because they were high. The two business leaders believe they can network instead at an upcoming hemp rally. There they may connect with a low-cost overseas fluorescent poster distributor whom Jones has heard will be in attendance. A partnership with this party will lower their collective overhead and give them the capital to back even larger, international expansion. ' It would be cool,'  Jones said, ' but if we had a shitload of stores, I' d have to make tons more bead curtains, and I don' t know if I could handle that.'  Their hope is eventually to sign a multi-million dollar licensing agreement to streamline and systemize production of items such as hand-painted drums, decorative pipes and one-of-a-kind bronze candle holders. To accomplish this goal, they need just one thing: ' I think we might need to write some kind of business proposal,'  Tobe said. ' I heard that you might need one of those to, like, show to people so they know you are a serious businessman.'  The entrepreneurs will carry out their plan as soon as they can locate Mitch, a third-year law student who once played in a band with Jones. They believe he can help them write any corporate documents necessary for their venture. One worry that could slow their ambitious corporate rise is that Mitch may have moved. ' I gotta find that dude' s phone number,'  Jones said. ' I hope he' s still living at that same place.'  Added Tobe: ' Yeah, if we find him, he' ll totally hook us up, because he always did us favors before and we used to get stoned together.' ","local, archive, news, vol 29 issue 02, local"
215,"Enraged Gorilla Beats, Maims Luggage Manufacturer","Still furious over his inability to inflict damage upon numerous pieces of high-quality Samsonite luggage many years ago, Bobo the Gorilla severely pummeled Samsonite CEO Frank Jurgens into a life-threatening coma yesterday. Bobo, a 550-pound African lowland gorilla, became enraged upon seeing the man singularly responsible for the development of the extraodinarily durable, long-lasting luggage. ' It was horrible, just horrible,'  one witness said. ' The gorilla would pick him up, spin him around, and throw him down, then hit him with the luggage. It would set him up against the wall in a half-conscious slump, get a running start from the other side of the room, then smash into him with the suitcase and rebound off the wall. It' d pick him up and spin him around in a pinwheeling motion, then throw him at the floor and bounce him against the wall again. It' d jump on his head, bounce up and down in a squatting motion on his chest, then pick him up and start the whole process again.'  Witnesses reported that the gorilla' s choice of weapon proved especially damaging to his victim, as its rugged, quality construction was able to withstand the most strenuous levels of wear and tear without damage, maintaining its durability as the gorilla repeatedly smashed it into Jurgens' s head, neck, chest and back. The beating, which took place behind a barricaded door in Jurgens' s deluxe mid-Manhattan office, lasted for over 20 minutes, and was observed via camera by the building' s security staff. Unable to break through the gorilla' s barricade to save Jurgens, they were helpless to do anything but watch the muscle-bound animal pummel Jurgens with blow after blow, expertly wielding the suitcase as a bludgeoning tool. The gorilla, born in the lowlands of Central Africa and transported to the United States at age two, seemed ' possessed of an almost deliberate single-mindedness, clearly seeking revenge for an age-old vendetta,'  before and during the attack, police said. The tragic incident began when Jurgens visited the Bronx Zoo during a family outing. Bobo apparently became enraged upon making eye contact with Jurgens during the family' s tour of the zoo' s ' Jungle World'  exhibit. ' He looked right at me,'  Jurgens said from his bed in the Intensive Care Ward of Mt. Sinai Hospital. ' I swear to God, his beady gorilla eyes looked right into mine. It was obvious that our fine product' s wear-resistant design had caused him years of frustration, and that he unleashed this pent-up anger in an outburst of savage catharsis.'  Shortly after seeing Jurgens, the animal ' went ballistic,'  according to witnesses, leaping over the concrete safety pit surrounding the enclosure and repeatedly tearing at the iron bars separating him from zoo visitors with his teeth and fists. Eight zoo staffers and large doses of tranquilizers failed to subdue the creature, who finally escaped by tearing a set of keys from a zookeeper' s belt. He resumed his pursuit of Jurgens, eventually catching up to him at his downtown office, where he trapped him in the penthouse and barricaded the door. All told, Bobo pursued Jurgens, who had risen to prominence within Samsonite' s ranks after featuring Bobo in a highly successful advertising campaign in the mid-' 70s, for over four miles. In the process, Bobo fended off capture attempts by no fewer than 12 zookeepers, a fully mobilized unit of horse-mounted police, and over 20 highly-trained Samsonite security guards. Although several of these men and women were mildly injured in their failed attempts to subdue the primate, the only person to sustain serious, prolonged injury was Jurgens, whom the revenge-crazed animal ' deliberately singled out,'  according to several witnesses. Zoo authorities claim the animal has never shown any sign of violent behavior. In fact, sources said, Bobo has always been an unusually docile gorilla, his friendly and responsive demeanor making him a favorite among children. ' He' s such a cooperative animal that it seemed natural to use him in the television commercial,'  Bobo' s trainer and personal attendant, Hank Prando, said. ' Little did we know that the luggage' s exceptionally fine craftsmanship would prove too much for the poor beast' s mind to take.'  After finishing the near-fatal beating, Bobo calmly sat down and rested for a few moments, then proceeded to quietly remove the office door' s barricade and surrendered peacefully to authorities. ' He seemed so happy,'  said one policeman present at the animal' s surrender. ' As they took him away, I saw a look in his eyes of utter peace.

216,Native Americans Ask Very Nicely For Country Back,"A delegation representing a broad range of Native American governments converged on Washington, D.C., today, presenting a prepared statement before Congress. The statement, described as ' extremely polite and respectfully worded,'  asked the U.S. government very nicely to return America to the Native American populace. ' We would like, pretty please, with a cherry on top, if we may, to have our country back now, that is, if it' s alright with you, and you' re done with it, if it' s not too much trouble, please,'  a portion of the statement read. Reaction to the courteous request was uniform and positive. ' What a nice gesture,'  Sen. Franklin Hall (D-VA) said. ' And darn neighborly of them too. We' ve broken all our treaties with them, and still they thought to include this lovely card. Look, it says ' Thinking of You,'  and it has a beautiful picture of a sunset on it.'  Hall went on to say that he was particularly impressed with the tribal leaders'  manners in light of the near-wholesale destruction of their populace, not only through military actions and pogroms, but also germ warfare and economic terrorism. When asked if he would give the country back, Sen. Hall replied: ' No, I do not think so.'  He then disappeared into his Congressional chambers, where he and several of his staffers shared what was described by observers as ' a long, hearty laugh.'  Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell (R-CO), the only Native American in Congress, was absent, having been tricked by the other Senators into trading his senate seat for a bag of delicious, fruit-flavored gummy bears. Also impressed with the exceptionally polite Native Americans was Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt, who told reporters that the tact, evenness of manner and congeniality of the Native Americans was one of the most touching displays of civic pride that he as an elected official had ever witnessed. ' The behavior of these noble Indians is truly moving,'  Babbitt said. ' I mean, you' d think they' d be more angry about it, after being force-marched for all those thousands of miles along the Trail of Tears in the dead of winter, dropping like flies from the ravages of smallpox.'  When asked if he favored returning America to them, he replied, ' Why, no.'  He recommended Native Americans focus their energies on building quality gambling facilities, rather than spending time trying to restore their people' s self-sufficiency and pride. Babbitt could very easily see the government donating money to that cause, ' seeing that most states would never sully their own land with the boozing and whoring that so frequently accompanies such endeavors.'  Despite sympathetic reactions, the delegation was not allowed into the legislative chambers due to time constraints, and instead had to deliver its statement and accompanying fruit basket via congressional page. After waiting 17 hours, it formed a circle and invoked the ancient ' Mashkawon'  ceremony, sitting and chanting quietly to protest the extensive delays. When the group did not move off the Capitol lawn after being asked to leave by security, the delegation was incinerated by air-to-surface missiles.","politics, archive, news, vol 29 issue 02, politics"
217,Single Rose in Ghetto Park Bulldozed,"CHICAGO' City bulldozers rolled through the South Side' s Marcus Garvey Park yesterday, crushing a single red rose growing from a sidewalk crack. The rose, which for residents symbolized hope in a sea of death and despair, was swiftly destroyed by the team of five 14-ton bulldozers, eliminating the last vestige of life and beauty from the dilapidated concrete park. Locals reacted with disappointment. ' Every day I would pass that rose on my way to school,'  Michelle Carver, 16, said. ' Its beautiful scent and graceful petals lifted my spirits, giving me hope that tomorrow would be a better day.'  Added Kevon Harris, 19: ' Last summer, my mother was sick, and I thought she was going to die. Every night, I would visit the rose and say a prayer to God that she would make it. And she did, thanks to that miracle rose.'  Upon hearing of the rose' s demise, Harris'  mother fell into a vegetative coma. According to city officials, destruction of the rose was unavoidable. ' It had been scheduled for demolition for some time now,'  explained Thomas Laughton, director of Chicago' s Department of Development. ' And unfortunately, once something gets on the city' s demolition list, there' s really no way to get it off. It' s unfortunate for the people of that community, but there obviously was a reason for it or it wouldn' t have been on the list in the first place.'  Laughton also defended the use of five dozers to destroy the single flower. ' It is possible that a simple garden tool would have done the job,'  he said. ' But in this case, with the concrete nature of the park and the amount of time the rose was on the demolition list, we couldn' t afford to take any chances.'  According to Mac Richardson, the driver of one of the bulldozers, the rose put up very little fight. ' I really wasn' t sure if I had gone over it or not,'  Richardson said. ' I just couldn' t feel its delicate petals and stem underneath an earth-moving 14-ton dozer. It wasn' t until I saw the flower' s limp, lifeless body ground into the cement behind me that I knew I hit it good.'  The other four bulldozers then followed suit, each rolling over the already-crushed flower until it disappeared into microscopic dust. In the end, no remains of the flower were left, as most of it was carried off by a gentle breeze, while some random particles remained lodged in the bulldozers'  tire treads. The space occupied by the rose will not be vacant for long. City officials have already announced plans to replace it with a brand new weed. ' I think residents will greatly enjoy their new weed. It will be a healthy, strong one, planted in a natural weed setting of rocks and broken glass,'  Department spokesperson Ellen Jacobs said. ' I am confident it will go even better with the park' s abandoned cars and broken basketball hoops than the rose did. We are very excited about it.' ","local, archive, news, vol 29 issue 01, local"
218,Church Cancelled Due To Lack Of God,"The South' Parishioners of Pastor Theo Leobald' s First Congregational Church of Holy Christ In Heaven will not meet next Sunday morning for a coffee social and morning Bible study as they do every week, gathering in fellowship and offering thanks and praise to God on high. The reason for the cancellation? Simply the fact that, according to Leobald, God does not now, has never, and will never exist. When asked why he is convinced of God' s nonexistence, Leobald became visibly irritated with reporters. ' What' re you, an illiterate peasant? Aren' t you familiar with 20th century thinking at all? Christ, read a book, or maybe just think about the idea for a minute. Pretty ridiculous, huh?'  he said. When pressed, however, he sighed heavily, and explained that thousands of years ago, tribes of nomadic desert peoples made up God because, being incapable of scientific reasoning due to caveman-like existences, they had no other way of making sense of things like sunshine, rocks and pork-transmitted trichinosis. ' They made it all up, and they were ignorant, unwashed, half-naked pre-historic barbarians,'  Leobald said. ' So who are you gonna believe: Carl Sagan, and the pantheon of the world' s greatest scientific and intellectual minds, or some guy who measured wealth by how many goats he had?'  Sagan, according to Leobald, is an ' astronomer'  in a big city far, far away who writes what are known as ' books.'  ' I just felt like an idiot saying all that nonsense week in, week out. What' s the point of singing hymns of joyous adoration to a fictional entity?'  Leobald said. ' Why convene to donate time, money and personal resources to a being which exists only in fabulous legends and mythological ancient texts? If we were to keep doing that, week after week, why, we' d feel ridiculous, wouldn' t we? Plus, we' d look pretty stupid as well. It' d be like talking to a wall, and frankly, I' ve got better things to do with my time. And I sincerely hope all of you do too.'  Although reactions among community members to Leobald' s decision have been varied, most have been positive. ' I never really liked getting up that early on the weekend anyway, but continued to do so out of gripping fear of having my entrails eternally ripped out by flaming scimitars after death,'  Gregory H. Tensdale, 51, said. ' But now that I know it' s all just pretend, I am no longer terrified.'  Tensdale concluded by adding that the uncomfortable dress-up clothes he has always detested will be on the trash heap by sundown, and that he fully expects to stay clad only in underwear until well after the game on Sundays from now on. ' I enjoyed the lovely singing during church service, and was very sad to see it go, particularly because I am a lonely septuagenarian waiting to die,'  Mabel Graskowsky, 78, said. ' But then Pastor explained to me that there are groups who get together just for singing only, and I could go to any one I wanted whenever I wished. Just singing! None of that boring inbetween stuff I always slept through. I' m much happier now.'  Not all opinions were as supportive. ' Who cares if God isn' t real? I say worship him anyway,'  School Board Member Fred Nichtenhausen said. ' After all, every grown-up man and woman knows Santa Claus isn' t real, yet we worship him every year on Christmas, the Holy Day of Santa' s birth, as prophesied by Nostradamus.'  Added junior high school student Curt Mondaham, who was unimpressed with the pastor' s speech, ' Big deal. He' s just saying the same thing Neil Peart' s been saying for years.'  For those who still want to worship, if not God, but just something, Leobald has started a Sunday morning group called The Church of Imaginary Make-Believe Land, where churchgoers will have their choice of nonexistent beings to submit to. Some of the worship selections include Poseidon, super-agent James Bond and fabled storybook character Peter Pan. ' I' m worshipping Peter Pan,'  Gladys Fye, 108, said. ' I do so love his adorable little pointed green shoes. Oh, that Tinkerbell with her magic dust!'  For his part though, Leobald says he will not be attending. ' I' m meeting once a week, not Sundays but on Wednesdays, with anyone who cares to join me. We won' t be worshipping anybody, just practicing my favorite hobby, horticulture. I' ll admit, it doesn' t have the power to grant eternal absolution from earthly pain, but at least flowers are real. We must cultivate our garden.'  Enlightenment Era polymath Voltaire contributed to this article.","religion, archive, news, vol 29 issue 01, the onion"
219,Billionaires Demand More Federal Scrutiny,"WASHINGTON, DC' In impassioned testimony before the U.S. Congress yesterday, a delegation of 30 billionaires demanded more federal scrutiny over their high-powered business dealings and vast capital assets. ' As the nation' s ultra-elite overclass, we billionaires have for years enjoyed nearly unlimited economic privileges,'  said J. Wellington Finch, 84, a Florida shipbuilding magnate. ' In addition to millions in questionable federal tax write-offs, we have been the beneficiaries of cushy tax-deferred annuities, oversized retirement funds and shady overseas investments routinely overlooked by the IRS and SEC. We are here today to stand up and finally say, ' Enough!' '  Before the hearing, the billionaires protested and camped out on the front lawn of the White House bearing exquisite pewter-wrought placards with beautifully detailed gold-inlay lettering reading such slogans as ' Stop the Insanity'  and ' We Demand Justice.'  Yet after one billionaire protester was thought to have damaged the fine fabric of his yachting jacket by sitting on the wet grass, the protestors abandoned the lawn and continued their protest by purchasing and developing all the land surrounding the White House, erecting lavish Vegas-style resorts with Caribbean decor. Teams of shouters then shouted protests such as ' Hey, ho, free rides for billionaires have got to go'  from atop the resorts'  jade-hewn mezzanines. The billionaires, meanwhile, enjoyed full-body mineral-oil massages and erotic mud baths in the comfort of their palacial suites. ' Fair is fair!'  cried Texas oil baron James Hersfers-Hunt IV at the congressional hearing. His hand-sewn Chinese silk slippers were shielded from the Senate floor by several layers of the finest linen towels flown in that morning from India. (He described the floor as ' germ ladened.' ) ' We control 30% of the nation' s wealth, while comprising .00000001% of the population. That' s outrageous. We must be stopped.'  The oil magnate' s tirade was stopped short by a minor cough, which was quickly suppressed through the administration of powdered rhino horn, a remedy imported from poachers at great expense from East Africa. Hersfers-Hunt' s sentiments were echoed not only by the other billionaires, but also by a throng of paid lobbyists who massed outside and faithfully repeated his every word. ' The billionaires are sick of having the power to buy and sell people as if they were a mere commodity,'  lobbyist Greg Hunjjlers said. ' I am being paid over $2,500 an hour to say this.'  Most congressmen were quick to agree with the billionaires'  demand for more scrutiny. ' We value our billionaire consituents,'  Sen. Gene McCready (R-ND) said. ' Whenever they want something, Rolls Royces, private jets, concubines and mansions start turning up at our doorsteps. We' ve learned that it is pointless to resist such extraordinary bribery.'

Those are the colors of the holidays. Merry Christmas, everyone out there in the world. I haven' t been wheeled outside since 1958, so I don' t really know what Christmas is like anymore. Do they still have presents? Is Teddy still showing the Mexicans who' s number one? Is the Secretary of War keeping an eye on those Brazilians? I don' t trust them. How about snow? It' s a puffy ice substance that falls from the sky. It sounds almost crazy to ask. Am I off my nut? The only way I know to gauge my sanity is my nurse. She' s the only person I ever see. And she never even responds to me. Just today I cursed at her at the top of my lungs for what must have been three hours straight, and she ignored me. Doesn' t she know I exist? If I could survive without her vital medical attention, I' d fire her fat ass and have her living in a cannery-row alley. No, I take it all back. I' d beat her.

221,Family Enjoys Winter Wonderland in Own Home,"Chicago' s Randall Clan has not had heat since early November This holiday season, families everywhere will gather to enjoy the magical traditions of winter: cross country skiing on a snowy dale, singing Christmas carols door to door, and building a fat, jolly snowman with Jack Frost nipping at their noses. But while most families will need to venture into the great outdoors to sample such holiday glee, one lucky family will enjoy the spirit of the season without going anywhere. For the Randall family of Chicago, a winter wonderland awaits right in their own home! Ever since being laid off at the rendering plant, Dwayne Randall and family have had a bit of a tough time making ends meet. First, their car was repossessed and the telephone was shut off. Then, thanks to the family' s inabilty to pay several months back bills to Chicago Gas and Electric, the Randalls'  heat was turned off, and the tiny rented flat they occupy became an icy playground of holiday delight! ' Pleaseû€f'  a shivering and blue Dwayne Randall, 41, told reporters. ' Mustû€f haveû€f heat.'  He then wrapped his arms around his son and began patting and rubbing his convulsing torso, giving him the biggest Christmas hug a young boy could ever want. Though times are tough, isn' t overcoming life' s adversity with good cheer and uplifted spirits just exactly what the holidays are really all about? Mother Ellen Randall, desperately melting water over a tiny, generator-powered hotplate, certainly seems to think so. The charitable enthusiasm with which she vainly attempts to treat her young child' s severe hypothermia is an example to us all that the true warmth of Christmas comes not from any gas company, but from our hearts. Its ceiling aglow with the tinkling of icicles, the kitchen is a child' s fantasy of a wintry igloo for one of Santa' s playful elves. The toilet, frozen solid by the subzero temperatures, may not be fit for use now that the pipes have burst, but it brings to mind the domain of the jolly Mr. Snow, Emperor of Winterland from the charming children' s book we all know and love. Yet, even in times of holiday happiness, all is not well. Collapsing into a coma, little Paul Randall, 6, turns a seasonal shade of blue, and it seems he has stopped breathing. Witnessing the sadness in the eyes of his loved ones, one is reminded of the touching scene in Frosty the Snowman, in which plucky Frosty melts away, leaving his friends lonely and sad at his passing. A tear rolls down our numbed cheeks. But alas! A spasm racks the boy' s frail frame! It as if Frosty' s magic hat has once again restorted him to life! All around the frozen apartment, there is once again a sense of joy and happiness, as the sputtering, coughing boy begins to move and stands once again. ' I beg you, Mr. Reporter,'  he says, eyes wide with innocence. ' Some foodE€¦ I need foodE€¦'  Don' t you worry, Paul. There' ll be plenty of cookies come Christmas Eve!

222,New Report: Drug Use Down Among Uncool Kids,"A study released this week by the Department of Health and Human Services reveals that drug use is down among uncool American kids. The federal study, conducted over a 10-year period, shows a dramatic decline in drug usage among uncool kids aged 12 to 19 since 1985, down from an overall total of .001 percent to .0001. ' Really, this should surprise no one,'  Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said at a news conference. ' If you' d ever met one of these kids, you' d be amazed if he' d ever left his own bedroom, let alone smoked a joint.'  Recently sanctioned federal guidelines define ' uncool'  kids as ' those who characteristically exhibit introverted, passive tendencies, physical ungainliness, academic aptitude, and who live in continual fear of things that really aren' t a big deal.'  Among the uncool kids who were polled for this study were computer geeks, people who couldn' t do chin-ups for the President' s Council on Physical Fitness tests, Forensics Club secretary-treasurers, school newspaper editors, and newspaper carriers who were saving their money to buy a Capsela set. Researchers conducting the poll believe that the decline is due to a resurgence in conservative values. The uncool youngsters themselves named many factors behind their unwillingness to use drugs. Forty-four percent were influenced by Nancy Reagan' s anti-drug ' just say no'  campaign as featured on an episode of Diff' rent Strokes. Fifty-six percent said that their parents would kill them if they tried drugs, and 62 percent believed that their brain cells would erode, risking reduced scores on calculus exams. An overwhelming 94 percent feared allergic reaction. As one respondent put it, ' I am allergic to milk, cats and pollen, and I am afraid that if I smoke marijuana Dr. DeSmet will give me more shots, which I don' t want because they are painful and cause small red welts to rise on my pale, doughy flesh.'  Researchers tried to measure the limits of this reluctance by assigning popular kids the task of turning their uncool peers onto drugs. Resistance was practically universal. ' I was trying to get this little geek named Paul to smoke a joint, all right,'  high school football team captain Chris Mitchell said. ' And he was all crying and spazzing out and going, ' noooo, noooo, noooo,'  and snot was just shooting out of his nose. He made us want to puke, the little suck. We were glad when he finally ran away. What a girl.'  Berkeley professor of psychology Theodore Wil-linger was circumspect about the findings. ' The laudable fact that these kids are no longer seeking out pleasure through drugs is, frankly, canceled out by the tortured hell they endure daily within their own miserably awkward selves.'  Among the un-cool subgroups, drug use was slightly higher among sci-fi freaks, but still only topped .001 percent by decade' s end. ' At ElfquestCon in ' 84, we were told that there was marijuana present,'  Kenneth Osoms, 25, said. ' My older brother said he had seen a marijuana smoking pipe with some charred marijuana leavings, but this I never witnessed. That is all I have ever seen at any con. This year at GenCon, I felt kind of sick after eating a corn dog.'  Government officials claim to be encouraged by these findings, but given the nature of the adolescent subgroup in question, have had difficulty showing much enthusiasm. ' You know, even I' m tempted to tell these kids to loosen up a bit,'  Shalala said. ' I mean, stay away from the heavy stuff, you know, the stuff that fries your mind, but c' mon, you can get away with a beer every now and then. An oatmeal ale is nice. Or ask your parents to serve a nice table wine, like beaujolais, with dinner. It adds a tangy zest to chicken and fish, and it' ll kind of take you out of your shell a bit, so to speak. I mean, live a little.'  The Associated Press and The Washington Post contributed to this story.","local, archive, news, vol 28 issue 18, local"
223,Nine Drawn and Quartered at Renaissance Fair,"RICHMOND, VA' Nine people were torn limb-from-limb and skewered through the anus with wooden stakes this weekend at the city' s annual Renaissance Fair. Organizers boast that the ' Drawn and Quartered'  show made this year' s fair one of the most authentic ever. The early-Renaissance torture demonstration was one of many improvisations that peppered the fair ground, performed by actors from the local theatre community dressed in period costumes. These performances have been a fixture of past years'  fairs. ' The skits where we publicly tortured and humiliated ' condemned heretics'  gave us by far the most response we' ve ever gotten,'  actor Paul Mealen said. ' Who would have thought that violence would appeal to people?'  In the skit, victims were randomly selected from the crowd, strung up on posts, and read official ' charges.'  A dirt-encrusted dagger was then used to saw off vital parts of the condemned. One man' s scrotum was cut off, causing his testicles to fall to the ground. According to witnesses, children at the festival then tossed the testicles back and forth as the victim watched. Vital organs such as the liver were cut out of further victims, then cooked and force-fed to them. The pale and barely conscious victims were then taken down from the posts and prepared for the next stage of their torture amid taunts and bellows from the crowd. ' We loved it,'  said Both University of Virginia student Steve Limeneg, who, along with his friend Alicia Ponfret, was attending the fair for the first time. ' It was like we were transported back to the real Renaissance. We got turkey drumsticks at the Ye Olde Grille, threw stones at the Drench a Wench booth' I won a stuffed jester doll' then we got to see this heretic forced to eat his own kidney.'  Added Richmond middle-school teacher Linda Rougfas: ' It was a lot of fun. They picked my husband out of the crowd and he thought it was a kick. When they eviscerated him and he started screaming and begging for his life and crying out to me, the kids and I did our part, yelling ' heretic!'  and so on.'  Next, four horses were tied to the arms and legs of each victim, and each horse was made to pull in opposing directions, summarily causing limbs to tear off and go skipping in every direction. Finally, the disembodied and helpless torsos were fed to packs of ravenous dogs. The victims'  horrific, wheezing screams caught the attention of the entire fair. ' I thought it was very impressive,'  said Her-man Kline-mest, an executive at a nearby bank who partook of the fair with his wife and three children. ' I en-joyed taunting the condemned, and my children enjoyed playing with the testicles.'  One volunteer was tied up and laid on his back spread-eagled, his legs held apart by a short beam roped to a horse. A long wooden stake was braced against a rock and inserted just a few inches into the participant' s anus. When the horse was given a snap from the whip, it bolted, causing the participant to be driven onto the stake until it thrust out of his mouth. Festival organizer Liz Fendamn has been under pressure to compete with nearby Colonial Williamsburg for tourist dollars, and she said the event was popular enough to guarantee a return next year. ' We try to give people a merry ol'  time, m' Lord,'  she said with a smile. ' Ye can bet yer knickers we' ll be doing it again.'  She hinted they may even have the performing troupe dress like Spanish soldiers and wantonly slaughter masses of heretical fair visitors. Though most everyone thought the fair was the most successful ever, several family members of the killed were not so enthusiastic. ' My husband and I came to the fair as part of our honeymoon,'  Jacklyn Welden said. ' When he was stabbed through the heart and killed for blaspheming the Pope, the fair suddenly became less fun.'  Welden added that she will not be returning next year.","entertainment, archive, archive, vol 28 issue 18, entertainment"
224,President Bill Climpton,"The Onion' s 1995 Man of the Year It is never easy for The Onion editorial board to choose the single most exemplary individual of the past 12 months. Over the proud course of The Onion' s 234-year publishing history, some of the world' s most outstanding individuals have been honored as Man of the Year. Who can forget such past winners as Crispus Attucks, Charles DeGaulle, John Ritter, The Guy From the Police Academy Movies Who Can Make Funny Noises With His Mouth and last year' s co-winners, The San Diego Chicken and Stomach Cancer? This year, The Onion is honored to bestow the award upon the 39th President of the United States, Bill Climpton. Indeed, this past year, President Climp-ton has been a significant force in the realm of American politics, and, some might argue, world politics. He is undoubtedly one of the most powerful men in the United States, making decisions every day that affect hundreds, if not thousands of people. From the White House in Washington to Camp David in Israel, Climpton has proven himself a fearless leader, particularly this year, when the threat of war with Russia and boiling tensions with our neighbors to the east have been as high as ever. But through it all, he has been a voice of courage, working closely with Parliament to make things better for people the world over. In matters of foreign policy, his reach has been broad and his record has been nothing short of spectacular. In Bangladesh, he cured four people with a very strong medicine. In China, he defended the rights of a guy who was going to be killed for saying negative things about something the government was doing. In England, he helped patch things up between Prime Minster Margaret Thatcher and Winston Groom' no easy task considering the enormous scope of their rift. Domestically, he has helped re-define Amer-ican life by proposing something about health care, building roads through the rocky Pacific Northwest and quelling a dangerous uprising in a part of the country where there was an uprising. And he has done all this in the face of considerable danger. In the past, people have tried to kill U.S. presidents, which has forced Climpton to hire full-time Secret Security guards to protect his ' white house'  and car. But even without the threat of assassination, it is clearly a challenge being Commandant-in-Chief of this great nation. It is a full-time job, often requiring many hours of overtime. Despite his hard work, though, he is still criticized by many critical people. Sometimes members of the press write negative things about him, and, in the past, even fellow politicians have spoken harshly of Climpton. At times, the criticism has even made him sad. But through it all, he has more than persevered; he has thrived. According to a neighbor of this reporter, who was still awake at the late hour this story was filed, ' President Climpton is a very good president. I really like his position on a lot of important issues.'  Bill Climpton serves this great country because he likes what he does. And that is undoubtedly the best reason of them all. Because if he didn' t like it, he wouldn' t be doing such a bang-up job. And he is doing a bang-up job. And for that reason, The Onion proudly crowns this nation' s 38th president, William Morehouse Climpton, 1995 Man of the Year. Congratulations.","archive, archive, vol 28 issue 18, the onion"
225,Bosnian Child Makes Fun Art Project with Mother's Skull,"TUZLA' It' s no fun being stuck inside the house all weekend because your town is getting shelled. Especially when you' re an energetic young girl who loves to play soccer and run relay races. So recently, when 11-year-old Stadja Petrovic of Tuzla was cooped up in her basement for three whole days because of a massive Serb counterattack, she made the best of a potentially boring situationû€f She made a totally fun art project out of her mother' s skull! Now that' s using your head! How did she do it? Well, it was easier than you might think! First, Stadja collected whatever she could find lying around the house for materials' crayons, glue, scraps of paper, rotting flesh of loved ones, glitter' you name it! Then, the resourceful little Stadja took the skull of her recently killed mother, the family had been saving for proper burial after the war, and decorated it with all the neat stuff she had collected. Finally, she drilled a great big hole in the top of the skull andû€f Voila! Stadja had made herself a way-cool pencilholder! Is Stadja happy with the way it came out? Definitely! ' I miss my mother very much,'  said the plucky Stadja, a fifth-grader at Stojkonovic Road Elementary School in Tuzla. ' Death is everywhere.'  Stadja was so proud of her new pencilholder she decided to bring it to school to show it off. ' At least if my mother is not alive, I can have part of her with me at school,'  she said. ' My two brothers died this year too.'  Apparently, we weren' t the only ones who were impressed with Stadja' s totally cool pencilholder. Stadja' s teacher, Mrs. Tudjman, was so taken aback by it, she decided to assign an art project to the entire class. Next Monday, all students are expected to bring in the body part of a parent or sibling to make a creative arts project. Much as casings explode in theoretically ' safe haven'  territory around their school, Stadja and her classmates are exploding with enthusiasm over their new assignment.

226,"Area Teens Wed, Horrible Life Awaits Pair","It was a festive, caring time in the Leske family' s normally dysfunctional household. The invitations had been sent out, the minister had been paid, the formal wear and limo had been rented, and the bar at the Eagles'  Lodge was fully stocked with inexpensive, low-quality booze. The faces of gathered relatives and well-wishers seemed aglow with a palpable sense of hope and excitement for the future. Saturday, Kyle W. Leske and his high-school sweetheart Tracy Esterzycek, both 18, of Pelmacher Memorial High School in Grove Prairie, were legally joined in sacred matrimony at Holy Christ Almighty Lutheran Church in neighboring Blano. Everywhere there was a feeling of joyous celebration, all of which was oddly inappropriate, considering that the occasion heralds the start of a miserable and desperately unhappy life for the young couple. ' I love Tracy more than anything in the whole, wide world' even my wheels,'  says Leske, beaming from ear to ear with a slavering, slack-jawed dullard' s grin. Visibly undisturbed by any real grasp of the horror of his situation, he joked with his ' groom' s party' ' a group of fellow auto enthusiasts from his third-hour machine shop class' about his luck at finding such a ' babe-licious'  bride. Unaware that he and Esterzycek' s sex life will come to a complete stop within six months, Leske claims that Saturday was the happiest day of his life, even if 80-hour work weeks at minimum-wage service industry jobs will rob him of all enthusiasm for existence before he can legally enter a tavern. The same sentiment is echoed by Esterzycek, a below-average student who hopes to one day work at a hair salon. ' Kyle, I love you, true blue, so I say I do,'  she says, reciting a poem she wrote for an English class in which she received a C-minus. Speaking in an arithmetic, monosyllabic, uneducated drone, she maintains her pie-in-the-sky fantasies of future family bliss with Leske in total disregard of her own vast lack of competence or skills in essentially any area. Desperate to procreate, not only from misplaced attempts at achieving adulthood, but also in a pathetic bid to preempt potential loneliness, she seems unmindful that her lack of maturity will result in the rearing of freakish, simian children whom she will viciously abuse, both emotionally and physically, in a vain attempt to stave off the agony of her daily life. Family and friends also seem unable to acknowledge the couple' s horrible fate, smiling and laughing in the face of these three basic truths: Esterzycek will achieve medically dangerous obesity within three years, Leske has never read a book for enjoyment in his entire life and people do not have to remain with the first person they have sex with for the rest of their lives. At the wedding rehearsal, they cried and hugged, deluding themselves into imagining that the upcoming ritual is something besides a mistake. As the wedding rehearsal drew to a close, well-wishers surrounded the couple offering smiles, encouragement and approval, despite the years of uneducated, unhappy, poverty-stricken alcoholism and domestic violence which await the hapless teenage simpletons. In fact, many of them, especially the older relatives and more devout members of Holy Christ Almighty, even privately thank God that the two teens are choosing to ' do the right thing'  and thoroughly truncate their development as human beings, rather than ' live in sin.'

227,Police Unimpressed With Rooftop Sniper," It' s Been Done,'  Say Officials HOUSTON' A rooftop sniper armed with an automatic rifle opened fire on a crowded downtown intersection yesterday, killing four and leaving area police officers greatly unimpressed. The seven-minute shooting spree, which also critically wounded at least 20 others in a busy lunchtime crowd, was described by the officers as ' uninspired'  and ' lame.'  ' To be quite honest, it' s been done,'  Houston police chief Karl Slawson said, stifling a yawn. ' Off the top of my head, I can think of at least five other cases in Texas alone where a guy snapped, got on a roof and fired into a crowd below. There' s just nothing new about it.'  The sniper, identified as 44-year-old Victor Huemanga of nearby Galveston, is still on the roof of the 21-story building and has vowed to kill again. ' I will drown this city in blood,'  he said. ' Bodies will line the streets and gore will clog the sewers.'  Police are taking a wait-and-see attitude. ' I' m just saying, he' d better do something different this time if he wants to get our attention,'  officer Russell Davison said. ' I don' t care how many people he kills, it' s got to be original. All the great killers have a hook. They don' t just stand up on some roof and shoot, even if it' s hundreds of innocent civilians. God, that' s boring.'  Said Police Chief Slawson: ' Come on, dazzle us.'  When informed of the police reaction, Huemanga vowed to ' kill and kill until the pain goes away.'  Families of the six victims have pleaded with Houston police officials to apprehend the sniper, but they have steadfastly refused. Instead, victims'  family members have been placed in a room and asked to fill out a series of complicated forms. In a prepared statement sent to the media, Huemanga explained his reason for the rampage. ' I want to vent my deep frustration with society, especially technology, which has made machines more important than people,'  he wrote in a three-page typed statement. The statement, like the killings, was met with extreme boredom. ' Boy, I' m surprised by his reasons,'  Slawson said. ' He' s angry at society and technology. I' ve never heard that one before.'  Slawson then rolled his eyes in an exaggerated fashion, underscoring the sarcasm of his comments. Huemanga has also made a list of demands, including $2 million cash. ' So you mean, if we don' t give him money, he may kill again?'  FBI agent Horace Gage said. ' No one' s ever demanded that before. We' d better get on it right away.'  Gage, like Slawson, was being sarcastic. According to police, the rooftop shootings represent the least original act of terror in the state of Texas since 1988, when a Dallas man kidnapped the wife of a wealthy oil magnate and held her for ransom.","local, archive, news, vol 28 issue 17, local"

229,Congress Hires Drummer,"WASHINGTON, D.C.' In a decisive 376-45 vote last Friday, the United States Congress hired drummer Joey Lombardo, a professional percussionist with years of studio and touring experience. Lombardo, who has toured with such diverse artists as Kenny Loggins, Pat Benatar and Richard Marx, is expected to provide the legislative body with a variety of much-needed percussive effects. ' You wouldn' t believe how much his steady backbeat helps keep bills and budget proposals rolling along, not to mention adding some zip to those filibusters,'  Sen. Alfonse D' Amato (R-NY) said. ' Lombardo provides a rock-solid foundation upon which Congress can really jam.'  The seasoned studio vet, who played with Bryan Adams on the Australian leg of the star' s 1991 Waking Up the Neighbors Tour, will also provide drum rolls during key budget votes. Before the vote tally for the controversial Steffens-Hawley Welfare Bill was announced Monday, Lombardo performed a dramatic, prolonged snare drum roll, which, according to 93' year-old Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-SC), ' made me tingly.'  Despite his lack of Congressional drumming experience, Lombardo is confident he has the stamina to keep up with the long-winded legislators. ' When I was on Tina Turner' s Break Every Rule World Tour, we did a show in Rio that was over three and half hours. I' m confident that if I can keep up with Tina, I can keep up with Orrin Hatch and Arlen Specter.'  With his extensive experience playing live, Lombardo also brings a theatrical sensibility to Congress. When Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich recently opened session with the remark, ' I know why Clinton didn' t want to play cards with me on Air Force One' he was afraid of losing all of his money!,'  Lombardo was on hand with a rimshot and cymbal crash to drive home the humor. Lombardo' s drumset, a Starclassic eight-piece kit with glitter finish and a half-dozen Zildjian cymbals, has been permanently placed where Vice President Al Gore used to sit. The top-flight set, which was profiled in the April ' 91 issue of Modern Drummer, has already caught the eye of a number of lawmakers. ' Boy, I' d love to get behind those skins,'  Sen. Jesse Helms (R-NC) said. Helms went on to say that if Lombardo could teach him his one-handed drumstick-twirling technique, that would be ' very cool.'  Other voices in Congress are also excited by Lombardo' s presence. ' The beat of the drum calls out to all peoples,'  Rep. Pat Schroeder (D-CO) said. ' Lombardo' s rhythms will represent the heartbeat of our great nation.'  Schroeder added that in his sleeveless red mesh T-shirt and tight jeans, the sinewy Lombardo is ' much easier on the eyes than Patrick Moynihan.'  Other instruments were proposed to accompany Congress, including a bass guitar, a pipe organ and a synthesizer, but it was ultimately Lombardo' s power drumming that won out. The two-time Drum World Drummer of the Month was eager to talk about his new job. ' I' ve had a lot of tough gigs in the past, but this one tops it,'  Lombardo said. ' I' ll be keeping the beat for the finest product of the Enlightenment, set in motion by our forefathers, swinging with enough finesse' yet also true crushing power' in rhythm to this intricate machine of Jeffersonian thought.'  Lighting a cigarette, he added, ' I hope my chops are up to it.'  A number of special musical guests have already been booked to sit in with Lombardo during lon-ger Congressional sessions. Among the artists: Tito Puente and his Latin Orchestra, Al Jarreau, and three-time Grammy-nominated saxophonist David San-born. President Clinton offered his congratulations for the Lombardo hiring in a press release this morning. ' After months of attempts to erode the American Dream with cruel budget cuts, it is heartening to see such a positive decision coming out of Congress,'  Clinton said. ' Ever since I caught Lombardo behind the set on The Hooters'  Nervous Night Tour, I' ve known him as an American who can really rock.'

230,New Study: Books Don't Take You Anywhere,"WASHINGTON, D.C.' Despite the insistence of librarians and elementary school teachers that books give readers a chance to ' travel to exciting new places'  and ' journey to distant exotic lands,'  a study re-leased by the Department of Education yesterday revealed that books do not take you anywhere. In its lengthy study, the Department made it clear that reading has never been known to transport readers to any place other than the general area in which the reading is actually taking place. It was also disclosed that even these local movements are, in almost every case, voluntary decisions made by the reader and not in any way attached to the reading process. ' People involved in reading often sit quite still trying not to move,'  Department of Education researcher Hannah Morton said. ' In fact, we' ve found that it actually assists readers in processing a text if they are stationary or fixed in one area.'  The study found grade school and junior-high readers particularly susceptible to the travel myths. In one case study, 9-year-old Justin Fisher began reading a fantasy novel by C.S. Lewis under close observation. After 60 minutes, the only travel to occur was a voluntary visit to the kitchen for a snack and two trips to the bathroom, both made because Fisher ' had to go.'  In no way, say researchers, did any of the travel involve evil witches, messianic lions or closet portals to other universes. ' I just stayed in my room without moving that much,'  Fisher said. Another case documented 13-year-old Elizabeth Wer-ner, reading the novel Lord Jim by Joseph Conrad. Fatigued after more than three hours of reading, the disappointed seventh-grader set the book down near her chair, having remained stationary the entire time. Morton, who has read over 15 novels herself, related personal experience to the study' s findings. ' I have a sturdy leather chair that I sit in when I read, and I have always remained in place while engaged in a novel,'  she said. The study noted exceptions to its findings, citing situations in which people read in buses, trains and planes. ' For some, reading can be especially enjoyable on, say, a commercial aircraft,'  Colin Hail of Doubleday Publishing said. ' But even if the reader is in motion while reading, it is clearly not a result of the reading itself, but rather of the moving vehicle.'  Inspired by the study' s findings, many youths are now calling into question the empty promises of library posters and classroom slogans. ' I hate it when you get excited about a distant land and then you don' t go there,'  Fisher said. ' Reading sucks.' ","archive, archive, vol 28 issue 17, the onion"
231,Point-Counterpoint: Reservoir Dogs,"by Chad Johnson, Sophomore"", ""by Dirk Hicks, Junior""""Reservoir Dogs is the Best Movie Ever"", ""Reservoir Dogs is Fucking Awesome"" Reservoir Dogs is the Best Movie Ever by Chad Johnson, Sophomore Let me tell you this: Reservoir Dogs is the best movie ever! It' s everything a good movie should be. You got great characters, very funny dialogue and tons of awesome action. Quentin Tarantino is a god. If I think about all the movies I' ve seen, and I' ve seen a lot, I cannot think of anything better. Star Wars, Blade Runner and A Clockwork Orange are all pretty cool. They' re all great actually. But Reservoir Dogs blows them away. Why? It' s just so fucking cool! For example, it' s told in this totally messed-up order. It starts after the crime is over and then goes backwards. That' s nuts! Like they' re constantly jumping back and forth between flashback and present. The way they introduce each character is by flashing back and showing how they got involved in the crime. I can' t even remember what happened first and what happened last, who knows what and who' s the baddest killer, and I' ve seen the movie over 100 times. Trying to follow the story is really hard sometimes. It' s very complex. I love the scene in the diner where Mr. Pink argues about paying the tip. That' s so funny, ' cause I have friends just like that. Me and my friends will rent it sometimes and watch the movie in the commons area. (Whitman House rules!) We' ll all wear our Reservoir Dogs T-shirts and each take a character and say his lines. Chicks just don' t understand this at all. In conclusion, I just want to say that Reservoir Dogs is the greatest movie ever made. Reservoir Dogs is Fucking Awesome by Dirk Hicks, Junior That dude doesn' t know what he' s talking about. Where he comes off with that opinion is beyond me. Reservoir Dogs is fucking awesome! Harvey Keitel is the baddest dude I' ve ever seen act. And unlike my esteemed colleague, I' ve seen a ton of movies. Three of my favorites are Blade Runner, A Clockwork Orange and Star Wars. Those are some cool movies. But Dogs, as it' s called by people who really fucking love it, like all my friends on my dorm floor (Tremain House kicks ass!), beats them all. It' s like, POW, POW, POW! There are so many guns in that movie, I bet it has more guns than any other movie. When that guy is bleeding in the back of the car, it' s like, damn, I know what it' s like to be shot in the gut. But he' s a cop' a totally bad-ass cop. When the other cops follow him and make a comment about how crazy Mr. Orange is for going undercover, it' s like Tarantino is making fun of police officers in a really sophisticated way. Then, when Mr. Blonde beats up that other cop. He really tortures him bad. I kind of felt bad for him, but then I thought, those are the risks you take if you become a cop. I wanted to beat up a pig once when I got my ID snagged at Duffy' s. I saw Pulp Fiction, but it wasn' t as good as Dogs. Keitel didn' t have a big enough role, and there were too many stories to follow. A good movie has only one story. And the end scene, they' re all pointing guns at each other and they all shoot each other. Where' d he come up with that? That' s fucking awesome!","archive, archive, vol 28 issue 16, the onion"
232,Hobo Clown Slaughters Pig Sidekick,"Hobo clown Moocher the Tramp led a life similar to that of any hobo clown: riding the rails, begging for hand-outs of food and clothing, scavenging for over-sized novelty shoes in trash heaps and entertaining young and old alike. What made Moocher different, however, was the presence of his best friend Hammy the Pig, the trained pet sow he raised from a piglet. Delighting children with her uncanny tricks, Hammy would dance, stand on her hind legs and even juggle multi-colored rubber balls with her snout. The sound of Moocher' s accordion, accompanied by Hammy' s happy squeals and oinks, was always guaranteed to alert children up and down the Sioux City Line that fun was on the way. That is, until last week. ' Due to the current recession, in combination with the onset of winter, Moocher the Tramp is sad to announce that his friend and partner, Hammy the Pig, has been slaughtered, filleted, and stored as foodstuffs,'  a press release from Moocher' s agent said. ' I know children are aghast at what I have done,'  Moocher said to the assembled media. ' But they don' t understand what it' s like to be a hobo clown these days. The poverty, cold, and unsympathetic brakemen can be unbearable. For a homeless vagrant to go on supporting a 500-pound sow under such conditions is just too much to ask.'  A mere 10 inches long when Moocher first began training his animal friend, the rotund Hammy had grown to 504 pounds when she was slaughtered for meat last week at age six. ' Those were six good years,'  Moocher said. ' Believe me, when you' ve got empty pockets and find yourself huddling for warmth on a freight car outside of Fargo, a sow that size starts looking less and less like a humorous sidekick and more and more like a couple months worth of pork.'  Hammy, whose slaughtered corpse yielded Moocher nearly 200 pounds of sausage, ham, ribs, pork patties, bacon, chitlins, pig' s feet (pickled) and head cheese, may be gone, but she will not be forgotten. ' I have in my left pocket a memento,'  said Moocher, his painted-on frown all the more tragic and emotionally evocative for the experience of his recent loss. Pulling out a small plastic-wrapped bundle, he said, ' This is all that' s left of Hammy. It' s my lucky pork chop, and it will be a part of every magic act I perform from now until the day of my death.'  The public may be reeling from Moocher' s decision to end his six-year partnership with Hammy the Pig, but who is really to blame for this tragedy? We must ask ourselves, is it a hobo clown trying to survive on the railways? Or is it the sad, cruel legacy of Reagan' s America? For Moocher, a single tear trailing down his stubbled, painted face, there can perhaps be no answer. The only solace is a few more more months of food and one fewer friend. The New York Times contributed to this story.","archive, archive, vol 28 issue 16, the onion"
233,,"On seas of blood we now set forth With blades of fear we gut and gorge We are the terror of the North Formed in Odin' s fiery forge. Beat them! Rape them! Blood! Blood! Blood! ITHACA, NY (AP)' This is a translation of just one of the verses which will replace Cornell University' s current fight song when Baron Kurt Von GottsblÃ¼diner takes over possession of the college on January 1, 1996. Cash-starved New York State put the land grant portion of the Ivy League school up for sale in a last-ditch effort to raise money for the state university system. The privately held portion soon followed suit, bowing to both pressure from Governor George Pataki and fear of pillaging on the part of the baron' s hordes. ' It' ll take some getting used to, but I think New York is going to love it,'  Pataki said. ' Making Cornell a barony will not only save our education system, but create a unique, laboratory-like opportunity for historians to study the effects of random tyranny and senseless violence on fresh-faced, upper middle-class college students.'  Baron Von GottsblÃ¼diner used funds from his inestimable family fortune to purchase Cornell, which is located in the small, isolated town of Ithaca and surrounded by deep natural gor-ges. ' It can be sealed like the turtle' s shell and de-fended like a hornet' s nest,'  Von GottsblÃ¼diner said. The Baron, who negotiated with the university this summer and began processing the legal work in October, has promised many changes for the Cornell students. ' Welcome Week'  will be replaced by a series of duels between male freshmen and the Baron' s legendary ' Horde of Skulls.'  Losers will have their heads affixed to pikes around the mall while winners will be indentured to the horde and trained for combat. Chancellor Vance Elkye told reporters that the new freshman placement system would serve as a guarantee that Cornell would remain as selective as possible. For incoming women students, there will be a lengthy test of purity involving relics of the Virgin Mary' s sheets which are said to turn black over the wombs of soiled women. Virgins will repor-tedly be sequest-ered in the new stronghold of Ris-ley Hall, while those of inferior moral stature will be set to work in the fields next to the art museum. Those fields will, in fact, see a lot of action, as English and math requirements will be replaced with a 60-hour per week ' Serfdom Re-quirement'  which will teach the value of sowing, reaping and submitting to harsh and unfair taxation. Students in the art and architecture departments have already been set to work building a frescoed chapel in the center of campus. When finished, it will be the tallest building on campus, featuring a 400-foot baroque spire. ' Its purpose is to bring their sinful toiling bodies and my majesty closer to the face of God,'  Gotts-blÃ¼diner said. Elyke said that despite the initial difficulties of re-adjustment, students can rest assured that the Cornell administration is overseeing all changes and will ensure that the university' s commitment to education and di-versity re-mains un-changed. Elkye ensured reporters that the hairshirt he and other administrators were wearing was ' good insulation.'  Not everyone in Ithaca has taken to feudalism like the Cornell administration, though. Area merchants have complained that members of the horde are already causing significant property damage with their nightly raids. ' Three times they' ve come in here and set fire to the sweatshirts,'  said Tom Sklar, owner of Kampus Kaboodles. ' And they blood-eagled my best clerk.'  The blood eagle is a favorite battle ritual of the horde, and involves pulling the lungs of your enemy through his back and flinging them over his shoulders, creating an eagle shape. In response to complaints, captain Gustaf Lieb-fraumurter issued a statement ex-plaining the Ba-ron' s position on the practice raids. ' This spring we will lead a glorious assault on the god-less duchy of SUNY-Bing-ham-ton,'  the statement read. ' No virgin will be left untouched, no field unscarred and the riches of their merchants will be showered upon us.'  Liebfraumurter ex-plained that the loot taken from ' the scum and villainy of Binghamton'  would more than compensate for any loss of life or damage done to local stores and fields.","archive, archive, vol 28 issue 16, the onion"
234,Student Slacks Off Due to Post-Coital Lethargy,"It' s been more than a little sluggish around university senior Eric Wheeler' s apartment these days. Work isn' t getting done. Classes are being skipped. And assignments have piled up. And all for good reason. For the first time in 16 months, Wheeler is engaging in sexual intercourse. The sudden burst of sexual energy has drained him of his motivation for all other pursuits' not that he' s complaining. ' I' m having a hard time getting interested in anything else these days,'  Wheeler says from his couch, wearing nothing but sweatpants and a sweatshirt. ' It' s 3 p.m. right now and I haven' t done a thing all day' except of course have sex this morning. That was excellent.'  He has not attended a morning lecture since he and Scrole consummated their physical relationship last month, and is in danger of failing two other classes for which he has neglected to hand in papers. When he does go to class, he doesn' t take notes, nor does he participate in discussion sections. Says Wheeler: ' I' m getting some action.'  While girlfriend Debbie Scrole has seemingly had no trouble adjusting to an active sex life, Wheeler can only sit around, nap on the couch, and occasionally get up to prepare a can of ravioli, which he has taken to eating right out of the can rather than preparing it on the stove. Wheeler had spent the past year and a half listlessly dating and finding sexual satisfaction only through masturbation' a habit in which he had been indulging in with alarming frequency. His lack of sexual activity did, however, contribute to a marked improvement in his academic perfromance. He earned a 3.4 grade point average during the three semesters he was not engaging in intercourse. Before that, when he was having an on-again off-again relationship with his upstairs neighbor Amy, his GPA was 2.7. ' Eric needs to not let sex be the only determining factor in his academic studies,'  says Dr. Patricia Molling, associate dean of academic affairs. ' While we have made exceptions in the past for those who have endured lengthy dry spells, there' s usually a two-year minimum before it makes it to my desk.'  At his current pace, Wheeler will earn a 1.9 GPA, an all-time low for a student who was once called ' promising'  by an undergraduate advisor. Others in the university administration see this radical drop-off in performance as a major strike against graduate school acceptance. Admissions officers across the nation will only acknowledge post-coital lethargy with trepidation. ' Only the most forgiving of admissions officials would look past such a drop-off,'  says Lynn Fulton, Emory University' s Dean of Admissions. ' But if Mr. Wheeler did apply here, we would of course factor in the reason for the bad grades, like we do with other extraordinary circumstances, like family tragedy and life-threatening sickness.'  Experts anticipate that once the novelty of the sexual activity wears off, Wheeler will regain academic focus' if it isn' t too late. Failing more than two classes would put Wheeler on academic probation' meaning suspension for a semester. Scrole, who claims to be energized, not drained, by the intercourse, doesn' t think it will go that far. ' He has already gone from two to three times a night to one or two,'  she says.","local, archive, news, vol 28 issue 15, local"

236,Snotty Teenage Girls Convene for World Summit,"OSLO, NORWAY' Delegations of snotty teenage girls descended upon the Norwegian capital from all over the world this past weekend, gathering for a historic five-day summit. The Inter-national Conference of Pretty and Popular Girls, which features representatives from 112 nations, will address the critical issues facing snotty girls across the globe, including boys, dressing cool and the mall. According to U.S. delegate Jenny Reiner, a 15-year-old from Miami, the primary goal of the ICPPGs is the elimination of all lameness by the year 2000. ' The current levels are way too high,'  said Reiner, who also heads the conference' s Sub-Committee on Make-up, Hair Spray and Scrunchies. ' All across the world, there' s just so much of it' gym class, reading, outfits that don' t match' I' m concerned.'  Reiner herself was recently affected by lameness when her parents took her and her two siblings on a family vacation. ' We went to Disneyworld and went on all these rides and stayed at this hotel together,'  Reiner said. ' It was so gay.'  Reiner still has not told her friends about the trip. Another major issue the summit hopes to address is uncool girls who think they' re you' re friend but really aren' t. ' This girl Xiao Bu always follows me around school and calls me up on weekends to do stuff,'  Chinese delegate Hsiao Chang, 14, said. ' And she' s a total loser. Nobody wants to be friends with her, but she always hangs around me' it' s totally embarrassing.'  According to recent statistics, across the globe, over 465 million ugly, uncool girls follow cool girls around, a 35% rise since 1980. While the world' s delegations have generally gotten along well, the conference has not been without its share of strife. Yesterday afternoon, during a multinational outing to an Oslo mall, Dutch representative Kari Olgstaad told the Ivory Coast' s Ngomii M' gunda that several of the Russian girls looked fat. She also told M' gunda she ' totally hates'  Libyan delegate Baszula Khalim. Minutes later, M' gunda told Khalim what Olgstaad said about her, even though she swore not to say anything. M' gunda also told Peru' s Juana Santos, who told Olgstaad that M' gunda said something, even though she promised to keep it a secret. ' I guess I shouldn' t have trusted her,'  Olgstaad said. She added that M' gunda' s native Bantu language is ' really stupid'  and that her home continent of Africa is ' totally poor.'  When notified of the multi-national squabbling, conference leader Kerri Hayes of Canada stepped in and issued the following statement: ' Guys, stop fighting! You' re ruining the summit!'  Seventeen editor Debi Fox, one of thousands covering the world conference, praised the delegates. ' These are teens of the ' 90s,'  she said. ' They' re smart, sassy and on-the-go!'  Fox says Seventeen will provide full coverage of the summit in its January issue, including a colorful, 14-page photo spread titled ' Fresh Faces,'  featuring a multi-racial collection of thin, clear-skinned teens wearing the latest fashions in playful settings.","politics, archive, news, vol 28 issue 15, politics"
237,Crazy Rat Will Do Anything To Survive,"As the saying goes, you can' t keep a good man down. Or, in this case, a good rat! Despite pesticides, traps, flooding, a constant lack of food and the universal hatred of almost all other life forms, Tootho the Rat just refuses to die! Will this toothsome rodent eat and do absolutely anything to survive? You bet he will! Tootho, a wild, disease-ridden 2-year-old rat from the urban hellhole known as subterranean Manhattan, has been impressing everyone from subway patrons to municipal sewage workers with his unflappable determination. Tootho may be a flea-covered vermin with a 30-foot tapeworm in his lower digestive tract, but when it comes to making it through one more day in the city he loves, he has a look in his eyes that seems to say, ' I demand more food sources.'  ' We' ve seen him do just about everything: eat garbage, swim through raw human fecal matter, eat other rats,'  says Jake Dones, a trash disposal worker. ' I once even saw him eat the eyes out of a dead wino.'  Fellow city employee Karl Pzcyszny was equally impressed with the loathsome rodent' s tremendous will to live. ' We' ve thrown everything we' ve got against him' poison gas bombs, death powder capsules, hidden steel traps, trained attack terriers' but he still shows up every day, ready to eat,'  Pzcyszny says. Ellen Burgess, a single mother and head of a homeless family of four, adds: ' You know what we saw Tootho eat the other day? You' re not going to believe it, but he ate a shoe!'  But what exactly is it that drives Tootho the Rat, giving him the stamina and tenacity to keep on keepin'  on day in and day out, never ceasing in his quest for survival? According to Clark Newman, head of New York' s De-partment of Sanitation, the answer may be simpler than it seems. ' The way we see it, Tootho is motivated largely by an instinctive urge to seek out a food supply, produce offspring, and succeed in the process we know as natural selection,'  he says. ' To the best of my knowledge, humans are motivated exactly the same way.'  But how long can he keep it up? He might end up chewing rubber matting, building nests out of medical waste, and impregnating female rats at an explosive rate well into the 21st century! He' s that determined. ' These vagabond shoes are leaving today! I' ll make a brand new start of it in ol'  New York!'  Tootho said at a press conference. ' The Big Apple! The Great White Way! I can see those neon lights on Broadway, baby! It' s NYC for me, sweetheart! There ain' t no city like New York City! Kiss me! Kiss me! If I can make it there, I' ll make it anywhere! I' m headin'  straight to the top, mama! Straight to the top! Watch me hitch my wagon to a star!'  After bowing repeatedly and blowing kisses to the assembled press, Tootho then scurried into a sewer pipe, where he proceeded to tear the rubber sealant off a septic tank run-off valve, gnawing vigorously at its coarse black surface while being drenched in sickening, poisonous effluvient.","archive, archive, vol 28 issue 14, the onion"
238,Government Issues Citizens Official 'Screw You' Packet,"All Federal Bureaucracy Consolidated Into One Convenient Mailing WASHINGTON' In a move designed to streamline government bureaucracy and better serve the population, an official Screw You Packet will be offered to all U.S. citizens, Clinton administration officials announced at a press conference earlier this week. The packet, which is to be distributed in conjunction with 1995 federal tax forms, has been developed to consolidate all the disparate methods of bureaucratic hassle and degradation that the government systematically dispenses to the citizenry into one handy, 9X12 envelope. ' The compact packet has been designed to be user-friendly and intuitive,'  said Sen. Charles Hankson (R-GA), who spearheaded the Screw You project through Congress. ' Simple in-structions and easy-to-remember acro-nyms make the filing process as quick and painless as possible.'  In a user-friendly package, easy-to-understand forms will guide individuals through the quagmire of government red tape associated with the process of dealing with the federal government. Filing the Screw You Packet is mandatory and easy. Here' s how: The first step in using the Screw You Packet is to calculate your Economic Mobility Factor (EMF) via the easy-to-use EMF 1138 calculation sheet included in the packet. Those with an Economic Mobility Factor of 90 or above may mail or fax forms SC0089' L and SC0065' dd to their local Screw You EMF Processing Center (SYEMFPC). Those in the EMF 90+ range who are unable to mail or fax in their forms may drop them off at SYEMFPC kiosks set up at post offices, public libraries and federal prisons in their vicinity. The Screw You Post-Deadline Enforcement Facility, a level-five Citizens Outreach Center (COC), has been designed to aid and safely house all citizens who have failed to file their EMF 1138 forms. To access the COC operator designated for your nine-digit zip code area, complete forms SC00X349' B and SC00X289' L in the packet and send them along with forms SC01P349' B, SC89F349' C, TL89' G349' GG, JK7f9, 39847' 2' B (dd' f) and SCIDUJE89 to a level-eight Citizen Outreach Facil-itator in your time zone. Those with an EMF of 30 or below will have the added convenience of filing their EMF 1138 forms after Citizens Ou-t-reach Re-loca-tion Trans-port (CO-RT) relocates them to the newly constructed housing and work environments in the Northern Alas-ka Moun-tain Range, just miles from the Arctic Circle. Those unable to file forms after relocation may submit them to a Citizen' s Out-reach Repre-sentative dur-ing midnight pa-trols and interrogations. Those with an EMF between 30 and 90 must submit their forms in person to a Screw You EMF Processing Center Clerk (SYEMFPCC). Appli-cants will meet with the SYEMFPCC and should arrange appointments via the State Application Auditing Appoint-ment Bureau (SAAAB). Once an ap-point-ment date has been set by the SAAAB, a Screw You Appoint-ment Con-fir-mation Card (SYA' CC' 842) will be mailed in three to four days. Upon receipt of the SYACC842, applicants will be required to register the appointment with the Screw You Local Appointment Registry Bureau within 48 hours of the receipt of the SYACC-842. Failure to register the appointment within the 48-hour period will result in a fine automatically added to their estimated SYEMF-1138 quotient. The amount of said fine can be determined by looking up an appropriate fine on the Screw You Fine/ Penalty Schedule 565612 (SYF/PS565612), which is available at the local Department of Fiduciary Adjustments (DFA). If there is no DFA in the applicant' s immediate Screw You zone, district, state or township, the applicant may contact the Federal Department of Fiduciary Adjustments in Washington, D.C., and speak to a Citizen' s Outreach Representative who will look up the predetermined fine on SYF/PS565612. Please note that there is a $50 processing fee for any and all telephone queries to the FDFA. Those wishing to charge the $50 fee can do so by mailing three copies of the SYEMF-1138, KSJU' 387' SK, SKSP' 90-EZ, and SC'  2389, with computer code 0101010 00010010101010101010101010101010 001000011011010101010101010101010101010010 and ACC-842, and forward them to the Federal Depart-ment of Fiduciary Adjust-ments Po-stal Pro-cessing Cen-ter (FDFA-PPC) in Boulder, CO. Forms re-ceived by the FDFAPPC will be pro-cessed and re-turned to applicants within six to eight weeks. Those who wish to receive forms sent to the FDFA-PPC in less than six to eight weeks may file a Fiduciary Cal-culation Acceleration Form 9056 (FCAF-9056) at their local SYEMFPC. FCAF-9056 forms will be dispensed between the hours of 7:45 a.m. and 8:45 a.m. and are distributed on a first come, first served basis. Completed forms should be returned to the FDFA in Washington, D.C. All FCAF-9056 forms that have not cleared authentication via the FDFA in Washington, D.C., will be rendered null and void and will not be forwarded to the FDFAPPC in Boulder. Applicants who misdirect their FCAF-9056 forms will incur a $10 per SYEMF-1138 factor fine. The fine must be paid within 36 hours or applicant will be subject to house arrest and strip-searched by the Armed Outreach Response Team (AORT), an independently operated division of the Screw You Outreach Con-sortium (SYOC).","archive, archive, vol 28 issue 14, the onion"
239,Shaggy Dog Too Late to Cheer Up Dying Boy,"BOSTON' Terminally ill 5-year-old Timmy McWinn, formerly of Medford, MA, had one wish before his tragic death last week: to be visited one last time by Bruiser, the McWinn family' s loyal and devoted English Sheepdog. Bruiser was McWinn' s companion and best friend during the better part of his short life. Unfortunately, the lumbering, lovable canine did not arrive in time to cheer up Timmy, and instead of making his last moments on Earth more bearable, he merely added to the uncontrollable agony and horror the boy felt during his final death throes. ' Bruiser was Timmy' s best pal and play friend,'  Timmy' s father, James McWinn said. ' He provided him with his only real moments of joy. So when we accidentally left the dog behind after a family trip to Canada, Timmy was understandably heartbroken.'  McWinn' s condition worsened after returning from Canada, victimized by a degenerative brain disease which slowly ate away at his mind. Doctors could find no cure, leaving Jimmy with one dream and one dream only: that one day, before he left this earth, he would once again hold Bruiser in his tiny arms. Despite flyers, mailings, inquiries with Canadian mounted police and a posted reward, the McWinns'  efforts to locate Bruiser roundly failed. No word of the sheepdog' s whereabouts came to the anxious family. ' We' d given up hope,'  McWinn said. ' Until one day, well, I guess what you' d have to call a miracle occurred.'  According to McWinn, sketchy reports began to trickle in that a dog matching Bruiser' s description had been spotted making its way across the country to where the dying Timmy lay. Bruiser, driven only by his love, was making his way across a continent, just to be with his pal Timmy again. The McWinns, as well as the hospital staff and a crowd of well-wishing onlookers, were overjoyed when a weathered, weary Bruiser arrived in the parking lot of Children' s Hospital. Eagerly, the group rushed Bruiser to be at Timmy' s side, but it was too late. ' Timmy was still alive, but his higher brain functions had deteriorated to the point where he could not recognize the dog,'  said Dr. Dan Pangloss, McWinn' s physician. ' When he saw the large dog' s slavering jaws, he felt only one thing' stark, heart-stopping terror.'  Timmy began screaming what onlookers originally mistook for cries of joy. Only after several minutes could they make out the child' s actual words. ' He was yelling, ' Get it off me! Get it off me! Make giant monster go away!' '  nurse Ellen Bram said. ' I tried to push the dog closer to Timmy' s failing eyes so he could make out the dog' s face, but he only screamed louder, calling on mommy to save him from the hungry, hairy demon. I' ll never forget how his little voice trilled into a macabre falsetto of sheer, unbridled agony.'  Timmy' s eyes rolled up into his head, and his diminutive body was racked by a series of painful convulsions. Within moments, and well before the dog could be removed, he was dead. ' It' s safe to say his death could not have been more horrific,'  a hospital spokeswoman said. Bruiser was immediately shot, and the dog' s corpse beheaded for laboratory testing.","local, archive, news, vol 28 issue 14, local"
240,Area Beatnik Digs That Crazy Bebop,"Jack Corso is not your typical young American. While most 23-year-olds these days are busy starting families and buying homes in the ' suburbs,'  Corso spends most of his time ' hanging out'  in jazz clubs with his friends, listening to the music of Negroes. Corso is one of the ' beatniks,'  a rebellious group of youngsters about whom everyone from neighborhood priests to the President has expressed concern. Popularized by Maynard G. Krebs in CBS-TV' s hit comedy Dobie Gillis, the beatnik is emerging as an alarming shadow figure in American society. So who exactly are they? And what do they want? With Corso' s mimeographed book of poetry, ' Hipster Incantations,'  selling nearly 20 copies at a local bookstore, he' s as good a subject as any for an up-close look at America' s new ' Beat Generation.'  We meet up with Corso at his apartment, or ' pad.'  ' What' s happening, daddies?'  Corso asks as he emerges from the darkness. His attire is as strange as his lingo. Clad in a black beret, turtleneck and sandals, Corso cuts quite an off-the-wall figure. Add a goatee, dark sunglasses, and a necklace made of tiny shells, and he' s downright ' out there.'  Before long, we' re off to ' dig some sounds' ' ' beatnik slang for listening to music' at Corso' s favorite hangout, the Pussycat Lounge. As he lopes along the sidewalk, Corso re-members the moment he first heard the music of Miles Davis, a popular jazz musician. ' I was hustling down this very street, man, cold and broke, when this blazing trumpet hit me full in the face,'  he says. Corso describes the experience as ' heavy.'  After Corso borrows a little ' bread'  from our photographer to buy a ticket, we' re inside the nightclub. Corso is immediately surrounded by a crowd of bebop people, whom he affectionately refers to as ' hipsters, flipsters, and all the hot sisters.'  His easy-going attitude helps him associate with everybody in the club, including several Negroes. Club owner Vince Stein is eager to talk about his most popular patron. ' He' s a poet and a tramp, a prince and a fool, and his mama don' t know where he' s at,'  Stein says. ' Plus, I can pass off my worst port for claret and he don' t know the difference.'  Although Corso is devoted to the wild pleasures of his beat existence, he admits that he' s lost several close friends over the years. ' Sammy. Darla. Crazy Neil. Where have they gone? Tumbled out onto America' s highways, like charcoal briquets tumbling out of their sad crinkly sack,'  he muses. Once we are seated at the table, Corso wastes no time in rolling thin black cigarettes and questioning my belief in the American establishment. I' m trying to convince him my hometown is Cleveland, not ' No-wheresville,'  as he claims, when the jazz kicks in. The effect of the bebop is instantaneous. Corso' s lips curl back at the shrieking trumpets, and his limbs flail with the thumping of the drums. A fusillade of fingersnaps fly from his hands. As the band nears climax, Corso leaps out of the chair, spouting his poetic praise. ' Blow, man, blow! Gettin'  hot, at the spot, where the haves and have-nots, gather to dig the sound, goin'  crazy un-der-ground!'  he cries. Well, all right, then. You don' t have to understand Jack Corso to realize that his strange ways and lifestyle undermine the American way.

241,"Hip New Alternative Band Has One-Word, One-Syllable Name","SEATTLE (UPI)' A hot recording by what listeners describe as a hip new alternative band was discovered yesterday by the staff of a local radio station, exciting numerous area music listeners. The recording in question, Double Platinum, by an unknown group identified only by the one-word, monosyllabic name KISS, was rushed to a nearby stereo where it underwent intense listening and scru-tiny by knowledgeable disc jockeys, many of whom have subscriptions to hip, al-ternative music magazines like Alternative Press, Spin, Op-tion and Rolling Stone. The recording was found by DJ Josh Negler while rummaging through K-ALT' s vast library of recordings for his ' Alternative A.M.'  radio show. Negler, 27, has been an intense fan and expert on alternative rock for over 18 months. ' The CD player was down, so I had to find some vinyl,'  Negler says. ' I never thought I' d uncover such an unknown treasure, which I knew was alternative right away, as soon as I saw the silvery reflective packaging.'  While none of the station staff was able to exactly categorize the new and innovative sound of the double-album set, it was described as ' heavy, kind of like Nine Inch Nails, with hard power-chord guitars like Pearl Jam and an almost industrial high-tempo rhythm like Tool or Filter.'  Songs such as ' Strutter,'  ' Deuce'  and ' Detroit Rock City'  were positively identified as ' alternative.'  ' Yeah, they don' t sound anything like Hole, Beck, Bush, Spore, Sponge, Tad, Ride, Clutch, Scrawl, Slint, Schtum, Lync, Gren, Seam, Dis, Dig, Mule, Gaunt, Az, Hum or Pram, but the band does have a one word, monosyllabic, name like Hole, Beck, Bush, Spore, Sponge, Tad, Ride, Clutch, Scrawl, Slint, Schtum, Lync, Gren, Seam, Dis, Dig, Mule, Gaunt, Az, Hum and Pram,'  music writer Jordan Kohan says. ' So they gotta be alternative like Hole, Beck, Bush, Spore, Sponge, Tad, Ride, Clutch, Scrawl, Slint, Schtum, Lync, Gren, Seam, Dis, Dig, Mule, Gaunt, Az, Hum and Pram.'  So impressed was Negler with KISS' s raw talent that he is considering asking KISS to play at the K-ALT' s ' Punka-palooza 1996,'  an all-ages benefit that has highlighted the best in new and unsigned bands with one-word, monosyllabic names since 1993. Further evidence of KISS' s alternative stature was offered by rock critic Howard Frankel, who points to the band' s use of theatrics and costumes. ' Much like seminal no-wavers the Resi-dents and Devo, KISS' s gestalt is a deconstructivist take on the extravagance and excess of rock and roll and the insanity of stardom,'  Frankel explains. ' By encompassing a per-sonae in the guise of the exact rock establishment they are mocking, via the use of absurd amplification and standard verse/chorus/verse arrangements, their worldview only be-comes more salient and biting.'  Furthermore, Frankel ex-plained that the band' s choice of the antiquated vinyl format (or LP) gives the disc a ' retro'  sensibility matching the ' 70s nostalgia sound prevalent in many tracks. ' In fact, KISS has so marvelously captured the retro look and feel that one can almost imagine the record being released 20 years ago,'  Frankel says. Excitement escalated af-ter DJ Heather Luken stumbled across a series of solo recordings re-leased by the members of the band' a pattern remarkably similar to a series of albums released by the Melvins, a seminal Seattle band in the late ' 80s. ' One' s by the star guy, another' s by the cat guy, another' s by the rock guy and another' s by that devil guy,'  Luken says. ' I like the cat guy.' ","archive, archive, vol 28 issue 14, the onion"
242,Weaned!,"Area 18-Year-Old No Longer Breastfeeding Local teen Andy Brown, a senior at Richland High School, was weaned yesterday, no longer requiring the nourishment of his mother' s milk-engorged breasts. The 18-year-old Brown, who has suckled at the warm teat of his mother, Gladys Brown, since birth, will replace her life-giving milk with that of a domestic dairy cow, effective immediately. For Brown, the weaning is a major step toward independence. ' After 18 years of sucking at my mother' s nipple, I am finally ready to become an adult,'  he said. ' Drinking store-bought, homogenized milk is the first step.'  Brown, who will attend the University of Illinois next fall, took his final taste late last night after coming home from a party. He enjoyed a large piece of chocolate cake and then nestled himself in his mother' s arms, suckling her breast until falling asleep. ' I' ll miss that a lot,'  he said. ' Chocolatey desserts just won' t be the same without having mom' s warm breast milk to wash it down.'  For Gladys Brown, the last feeding was difficult as well. ' I will dearly miss the special warmth and closeness breastfeeding my child provided,'  she said. ' I will also miss spending hours each night icing down my swollen, horribly distended areolas.'  The proud mother has produced an estimated 9,800 gallons of milk since 1977. Brown is the first of his friends to stop breastfeeding. ' No way I' m getting off mom' s breast just yet,'  close friend Dave Evans, 17, said. ' College is gonna be a big change next year, and I need that support. If I go to school far away, I' ll have to find a wet nurse.'  Evans hopes to breastfeed until age 25. ' By then I' ll probably have a real job and be on my own,'  he said. ' I guess.'  Brown officially began his post-breastfeeding life this morning, taking his first taste of homogenized cow milk. Pouring a cup of refrigerated, store-bought milk into his breakfast cereal, he detected the difference immediately. ' This milk is gross' it' s cold, watery and bland' nothing like my mother' s warm, rich milk,'  Brown said. ' It will take some getting used to.'  Despite Brown' s initial dislike of processed cow milk, he does recognize one of its advantages. ' This will make it much easier to drink milk away from home,'  he said. ' I will no longer need my mother' s nipple to enjoy milk' s wholesome goodness.'  Specifically, Brown plans to take advantage of special portable milk cartons sold at food stores, which his parents will purchase for him and store in the family fridge. Experts praised Brown' s decision to wean. ' Going off breast milk will be a major step toward independence for Andy,'  sociologist Lois Winters said. ' Next year, when he goes to college, he will learn to seek out milk on his own and perhaps pay for it. It' s part of a growing up process we all go through.'  While the majority of experts agree with Winters, many still question the move. ' Brown is making a mistake in weaning, as breast milk is extremely nutritious,'  dietitian Charles Strum-mins said. ' Not only does it provide children with the right balance of nutrients, but it' s also high in antibodies and encourages better development of the dental arch.'  Strummins added, ' It' s also delicious.'  Child psychologist Arthur Hopkins also questioned Brown' s decision. ' Andy is simply not ready,'  he said. ' At 18, children still receive everything they need from their parents. How could a child that age possibly be expected to fend for himself?' ","archive, archive, vol 28 issue 13, the onion"
243,"Police to Pillage, Terrify Community"," Operation Psycho Pig Rampage'  to Begin Tonight LOS ANGELES (AP)' Citing revenge for what they bill a consistently deteriorating support base and general lack of appreciation, area police are gearing up to get even with the community this evening. Their plan, known as ' Operation Psycho Pig Rampage,'  calls for the pillaging of homes, harassment of passersby and random shooting of harmless motorists. Officers cited both the O.J. Simpson and Rodney King trials as two incidents that have enormously undermined America' s faith in the police. According to police department insiders across the nation, African-Americans have direct reason to hate the police. In addition, many whites are filled with a once-removed, transitive sense of guilt/em-pathy for the abused black populace. ' The black community has nothing short of a gnawing hatred and mistrust of law enforcement officials,'  Deputy police chief Gary Chower said. ' And well they should. But that doesn' t mean we are not going to whup major ass this evening, when we roll through the community with the soul-crushing force of a Third World totalitarian autocracy.'  Police department insiders went on to cite years of verbal abuse by citizenry, public portrayals of police as villainous cogs of the system, and repeated lampooning in trucker-themed feature films as further reason for their rage. ' Operation Psycho Pig Rampage will undoubtedly be the average white middle-class liberal' s nightmare,'  Officer Harrison Timkin said. ' Not only will we subdue citizens with gas and billy clubs, but we hope to terrorize them psychologically as well, using menacing pig-faced tear gas masks to strike fear into their hearts.'  By Saturday the police hope to have needlessly maced, beaten and abused vast sections of the general populace and to have illegally jailed and detained hundreds more. Psycho Pig organizers plan to use enormous loudspeaker amplification on city street corners to generate oinking and snorting sound effects as they beat citizens into hobbled submission. Officers are convinced this is both fitting retribution and a necessary step for the populace to understand law enforcement officials'  new role in the American community. One young police officer, rookie cop Roy Beamer, is looking forward to Psycho Pig Rampage with some reservation. ' I just joined the force and I' m not sure this whole rampage is right,'  Beamer said. ' But the captain and all the other guys want me to do it, so I guess I' m in support of it.'  Beamer plans to use his riot stick to beat old women until they involuntarily relieve their bowels. Those in the community have not been supportive of Operation Psycho Pig Rampage, suggesting that it may be in violation of the inherent trust that many citizens have for their public servants. ' I fear for my life and my children' s lives,'  area resident Madge Kimterfon said. ' Please help us.'  Said resident Maureen Hemterfagh: ' My God, they' re going to kill us all.'  Law enforcement officials fear neither reprisals, nor punishment for their actions. ' We are the only members of the community trained and sanctioned by the people to use violence, even deadly force, at our discretion,'  Chower said. ' Truly, the streets will run red with the blood of the innocent.'  State and federal support for the soon-to-be-ravaged city is unlikely, as many government officials see this as a local issue, best dealt with by local authorities, namely, the police.","archive, revenge, archive, vol 28 issue 13, the onion"
244,Drunken Man Makes Interesting Point About Society,"A local drunken man made an interesting point about society late last night, incisively commenting on the U.S. government' s strangely misplaced priorities. Art Telsker, a 42-year-old plant supervisor, made the insightful, pointed remark at about 11:45 p.m. at the Starlight Motor Lodge Bar, where he had spent the night drinking himself into an inebriated stupor. ' It' s like the government, they got enough money to build bombs and guns, but they don' t got enough to feed people,'  Telsker sharply noted to several strangers as he downed a double shot of Wild Turkey whiskey. ' They got it all totally backwards, man.'  He then added, ' It' s crazy, man, you know?'  before urinating on himself and staggering home. Telsker' s prescient political observation immediately impressed his fellow bar-goers. ' What Telsker said was right on target,'  said Stan Eckles, 35, who was also drunk. ' He was talking about how we spend more money on the military and defense than we do on social programs like welfare. And his conclusion was right: That truly is misdirected spending.'  Wayne Tolleson, who was nursing a scotch and soda next to Telsker at the time, agreed. ' I wish I could remember exactly how he put it, because it was so perfect,'  he said. ' He just cut right to the essence of the whole problem in this incredible way.'  Tolleson killed a family of six later that evening in a drunk driving accident. When asked to elaborate on his opinion of U.S. budgetary spending, Telsker responded, ' I was talkin'  to this one chick for like an hour last night and I was sure something was gonna happen,'  he said. ' But then after I threw up, she told me she was married and left.'  News of Telsker' s politically charged words quickly reached Washington. ' Until now, I have been one of the leaders in the movement to cut welfare spending while maintaining military expenditure at its current level,'  Spea-ker of the House Newt Gin-grich said. ' But it is now clear that, as Mr. Telsker puts it, ' We' ve got it all totally backwards, man.' '  The New Re-pub-lic magazine was also moved by Jablonsky' s cutting-edge commentary, devoting most of its next issue to the views of the twice-divorced alcoholic plant supervisor and father of five. ' Solutions to major societal problems do not always come from within the Washington beltline,'  editor Andrew Lerman said. ' Often, they come from uninformed, blue-collar Americans who spout their ignorant, oversimplified solutions to complex, real-world problems to anyone who will listen.'  In addition to his appearance on the cover of The New Republic, Telsker has been booked in numerous political round table discussions, including Crossfire and the McLaughlin Group. President Clinton has also expressed interest in consulting Telsker on a number of critical domestic is-sues. ' Mr. Telsker has a clear sense of what is good policy and what is just out of whack,'  Clinton said. ' I will consult with him daily in the months to come.' '  This is not the first time Telsker has boldly questioned the priorities of American society. Last August, after drinking a case of Old Milwaukee beer in the cab of his pick-up, he muttered to himself, ' The cops, man, they just sit around all day, give jaywalking tickets and eat donuts.'  The remark led to sweeping changes in police department standards and procedures across the nation.","archive, alcohol, archive, vol 28 issue 13, the onion"
245,Chess Prodigy Gives Up Game After Getting Laid,"To 14-year-old Milton Hervishbolt, the thrill of an efficient checkmate used to be the most rousing bodily sensation imaginable. A pawn promotion for a last-second Queen assault used to stoke the fire of life' s passion. A careful study of grandmasters like Ponziani, Fisher and Karpov used to occupy every synapse of his mind. But no more. ' Milton recently had his first sexual experience,'  chess coach Sergei Kostronvich said. ' And his interest in the subtleties and beauty of the game of chess has been usurped by a newfound interest in ejaculation.'  Hervishbolt' s experience, delineated by Kostronvich at a press conference, took place at a downtown hotel where a juniors chess tournament was held last weekend. According to Kostronvich, the busty wife of a tournament organizer lured Hervishbolt to her hotel room and rubbed his genital region briefly, causing him to ejaculate. He then promptly fled. ' I' m not sure what she did,'  Hervishbolt said, ' But it felt even better than when I beat Ned Tiedelman with a Muzio gambit in the third-level junior masters last fall.'  Many young chess masters leave the game after discovering sex, according to a recent Chess Monthly study. ' The human orgasm is reportedly very pleasurable,'  chess analyst Doris Gyklina said, herself once a grandmaster. ' From the time of first orgasm on, a chess prodigy, if given the choice between the carnal forces of human sexuality and playing a game of chess, will invariably choose sex. Especially if it is with another human.'  According to his coach, Hervishbolt' s only previous contact with a female took place in a tri-state rank trial. Hervishbolt was pitted against a 9-year-old female opponent, Sandra Kloust, renowned in her upstate New York school district for her undefeated elementary chess record. ' It didn' t matter to Milton that she was a female,'  Kostronvich said. Reportedly, the girl' s flat chest and underdeveloped pheromone glands made her incapable of arousing the boy. Hervishbolt' s seductress, 43-year-old Wendy Menkis, supports Hervishbolt' s decision to give up the game. ' I have always fantasized about tea-ching a fresh young boy the art of making love,'  Menkis said. ' I find their youth and inexperience an in-credible turn-on.'  When asked, Men' kis admitted she does not care about chess, nor does she have any interest in learning the intricacies of the game. Hervishbolt, also no longer interested in chess, plans to pursue more sexual experiences. ' I will employ the technique of encirclement to ensnare a female,'  he said, outlining his plans for the immediate future. ' Threat-ening a for-king check, i.e. N-K7ch, I will capture her En Passant, much like the pawn. It is at that point that I will be in position to touch her boob.'

Second, MDID stands for My Dad Is Dead, but self-named band leader Mark Edwards abbreviated the name after repeatedly being asked what it meant. Third, Edwards sounds a lot like Joy Division' s Ian Curtis. One would assume the ûlûoodgates for musical pretension would be wide open. That may be true, but Edwards is adept at blending low-ûlû punk hooks with challenging guitar and monotone vocals. It' s dirty, it' s pretty, it' s an intense listening experience, and thankfully the lyrics aren' t as embittered as one might expect.

Dischord Records sells its discs mail order at half most albums'  list price. Cruz Records also charges a reduced list and offers advertising support for stores that carry used CDs.

Buy This Used Compact Disc, a generous compilation featuring 22 artists and 73 minutes of music, sells for a ludicrously paltry $5.98' $5.98!

249,Saturday Morning Live Is A Comedic Masterpiece!,"There are ulterior motives hidden behind many of the articles you read in today' s media. For example, if Time magazine runs a glowing review of a movie being released on Warner Bros., the revenue generated by the article' s inûlûuence goes to Time-Warner, Inc.' which in turn uses the money to produce more issues of Time magazine. Though many feel this is an unethical system, we at The Onion both respect and honor it. We honestly believe everyone should attend the spectacular play Saturday Morning Live, which pays tribute to the hilarious cartoons of our childhood. There are countless reasons to attend this ûlûne show, which, incidentally, is being underwritten by The Onion, Inc., and the local modern rock radio station, WMAD. Performed by graduates of Chicago' s famous Second City, Saturday Morning Live pays tribute to 1970s children' s programming like Scooby Doo, The Superfriends, Hong Kong Phooey and Fat Albert. Complementing these sketches are renditions of old commercials as well as ABC' s Schoolhouse Rock classics like ' Interplanet Janet,'  ' Conjunction Junction'  and ' Lolly, Lolly, Lolly Get Your Adverbs Here.'

The book, on the same subject that he teaches in his popular class at the university, will reportedly have several hundred pages. On the pages, Chaptman said he fully intends to have printed words, as well as page numbers. The book will be bound, in all likelihood, by a publishing house or printer.

251,Friction Must Be Eliminated!,"Toward a Purer Physics If there is a Satan, fellow travellers on this hurtling ball of cosmic mud, it is friction. If there is one insidious force robbing our daily toil of its intended efûlûciency, it is friction. If there is one plague the great minds of all nations must join together to cure, it is the tyranny that friction has established over all natural processes. Without bringing its cruel reign to an end, the human race will never take its place among the gods. Friction! The very sound of the word is harsh and brutal. And why should it not be so? Think of friction' s perverse campaign of obstruction' every step you take, from cradle to grave, hampered by friction' s invisible presence. Your workplace travail, encumbered by its wraithlike weight. Mankind' s efforts, thwarted at every turn by the demon friction, without whose evil obstruction we would long ago have broken the surly bonds of Earth to tread the soil of distant worlds. But most horrifying of all is the manner in which friction' s tendrils have curled their way into the heart of the mundane. Horrible to contemplate, yet true!

252,Highbrow Student Apartments Offer Authentic East-Coast Feel,"Wealthy Tenants Gladly Pay Extra For Filth, Crime And Vermin Student housing usually involves shoddy accommodations, sparse furnishings, and tenuous landlord' tenant relations. But some students, unburdened by day jobs, student loans, or ûlûnancial limitations of any kind, require a bit more to maintain tolerable daily comfort. For these students, a new rental package is being offered by Le Mons, the luxurious downtown housing facility built last year to accommodate the rising number of upper-crust students in attendance at the University (following the recent toughening of admissions standards at east-coast schools). Students are able to special-order such services as standing pools of urine, random sporadic gunûlûre, frozen corpses on their doorsteps, and the new Infest-O-MagicTM process, which brings authentic Manhattan-style cockroaches directly into the customer' s home. ' Let' s face facts,'  Le Mons owner Ruth Hazelwood said. ' My tenants aren' t just any ordinary kind of people. They' re used to the very best, and have high standards for their cultural environment. It is important that, as displaced Manhattanites, they continue to enjoy the elite lifestyle they' ve grown accustomed to.

This winter, those residents will pay homage to the source of that scent when the town hosts its ûlûrst Municipal Bus Pageant. Scheduled to take place in mid-February, the Bus Pageant promises to be spectacular. Arcola mayor Alfred Krauss said in a nationally televised news address. ' Connoisseurs of city bus travel know that the Arcola Mass Transit system boasts the loveliest bus ûlûeet, and also lays claim to the least bus-related deaths and mental-illness-related mucous slippage. The opening ceremony, to be held at the Municipal Garages, will feature a solemn ' blessing of the buses'  by Bishop Richard Freehley.

A promedade following the ceremony will feature every Arcola bus in a continuous convoy through the city' s industrial district. Scheduled to appear as the pageant' s head judge is Dean Frinisd, the guy who sits in front of the bus and talks to himself. When asked for commentary on the pageant, Frinisd said ' Bitch! You bitch! Lie to me, will you? You bitch!'  Bus Operations Chief and Pageant organizer Warren Ludlow said. ' He' s been a loyal passenger for over two decades and has helped push the Arcola bus system into the ' 90s. To christen the lead bus in the promenade, Frinisd will defecate in his trousers, scoop out a handful of his feces and use it to spell the word bitch on the side of the bus. The Bus Pageant ceremony will take place in the parking lot of event co-sponsor Benderman' s Slaughterhouse.
