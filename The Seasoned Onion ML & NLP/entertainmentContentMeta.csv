'I don't even think of it as infidelity because I got tacit permission to pursue this relationship. It's usually pretty easy for me to separate work and personal life, but never before had I felt such a strong connection. It was like we had known each other our whole lives'we had more in common than I could ever imagine. We'd shoot our scenes and I would just lose myself in those kind eyes.'

7,Economist Has Great Idea For Sitcom Where Keynesian And Friedmanite Have To Live Together,"NEW HAVEN, CT'Revealing that he already had enough story arcs to fill a couple seasons of the show, economist John Stephens confirmed to sources Monday that he has a great idea for a sitcom where a Keynesian and a Friedmanite have to live together. 'So get this: Doug and Jeff have totally opposite beliefs about macroeconomic theory and what drives economic cycles'think of all the hijinks in their conflicting approaches to buying a new dishwasher alone,' said the excited economist, who added that he was thinking of titling the multi-camera half-hour comedy about the two acolytes squabbling over chores, noise, and exchange-rate flexibility It's The Economy, Stupid, and ideally that Simon Helberg and Neil Patrick Harris would star. 'I have a buddy in Hollywood who I sent my pilot to, and I don't see how they couldn't give this a full run. Just imagine the arguments: 'Oh, you demand that I clean the dishwasher? You don't know anything about demand!' You'd have the Friedmanite, Doug, trying out all these crazy schemes to try to earn money through supply-side market manipulation. And when the Keynesian, Jeff, is trying to find a job, Doug keeps telling him that the government doesn't owe him employment. But of course they'd learn things from each other too over the course of the show'the Keynesian would soften his stance on aggregate demand, and the Friedmanite would admit that maybe he could stand to be a little bit more understanding about deregulation. They'll also have this crazy Hispanic communist neighbor who both of them are constantly trying to get to move out. Plus we could get cool guest stars, like Alan Greenspan!' At press time, the studio had passed over Stephens' sitcom idea in favor of a single-camera show by a psychologist where a Freudian and a Skinnerian have to live together.","vol 56 issue 26, television, entertainment"

'It's just unfair that this guy could keep Drake from his rightful place on the charts by putting out quality music that he actually cares about,' said Aiden Howard, 14, who echoed the sentiments of Drake fans worldwide in his assertion that the artist's mediocre B-sides deserved more acclaim and recognition. 'He clearly gamed the streaming numbers when he decided to put time and energy into his craft. It's such horseshit that Billboard rewards that behavior and punishes Drizzy for making a half-assed mixtape full of songs he'd already dropped on SoundCloud.

'Everyone looks at me and just sees a guy who makes cakes and cookies. Well, I'm going to change a few attitudes by the time I'm finished here. Pastry chefs can do anything anyone else can do. Give me a shot and I'll prove it.' Reports confirmed that by the episode's end Calbert had lost a challenge and been eliminated for the season. ","vol 56 issue 19, food, cooking, entertainment"

'It's fascinating to explore this undiscussed time in Michelle Obama's life where she was merely an embryo feeding off nutrients from a yolk sac,' said film critic Robert Vogt, describing how the first two-thirds of the film depict Obama's first eight weeks in the womb, followed by the final 30 minutes of the film running through her time in the fetal stage up to 2016. 'The embryonic stage was an extremely formative time for her. Even if you're not the biggest fan of Michelle or Barack Obama, it's inspiring to see how one of the most powerful women in the world started off as a mass of cells in a uterus. Little did that single-layered blastula on the South Side of Chicago know that she would one day become a multi-layered gastrula.'

'On the one hand, I worried that referencing computers might go way over viewers' heads, but on the other, it made sense for a story about developers to get a bit more technical. If they're anything like me, I'm sure fans of the show will run to their local library to find out more about computers. I did, and a librarian actually let me try out a desktop model they had right there in the reading room!

'In the interests of encouraging film viewers to be safe, we have chosen to skip theaters altogether and instead reach audiences by transmitting this epic tale of a legendary warrior who risks everything for her family into the minds of all current U.S. residents,' said Disney Bob Chapek, encouraging the 330 million domestic viewers of Mulan to reduce transmission of the coronavirus by staying home, where regions of their brain vital to memory formation and linguistic processing would be hijacked to deliver a dazzling, unforgettable cinematic experience. 'Fans who were disappointed to hear of the film's delayed release will be relieved to know that on Apr. 17 at 6 p.m., their visual and auditory cortices will be overwhelmed with impressions of Liu Yifei portraying a fearless young woman who disguises herself as a man to fight for her country in her father's stead. Our Imagineers have ensured this mostly radiation-based procedure will allow one's sensation of self to fade away completely until their entire experience of reality becomes Mulan. We're certain that having every detail of this movie vividly and permanently etched into your long-term memory will be well worth the temporary loss of motor function, moderate risk of intracranial aneurysm, and mandatory charge of $14.99.' Hillman went on to confirm that Disney would be streaming the 1998 animated version of Mulan on a continuous loop in the dreams of each American for two weeks prior to the new film's release.","disney, movies, coronavirus, news, vol 56 issue 13, entertainment"

'Family and friends told us that as time wore on, they eventually noticed his body's slow deterioration, observing that he developed the telltale liver spots, gray hair, and gaunt face that so many of the elderly display. Of course, Mr. Douglas knew the risks, but once he started dabbling in age past 80 or 90 years, all that time began to catch up with him.' Ward went on to tell reporters he hoped this tragedy would serve as a cautionary tale, and warned anyone with an octogenarian in their family to seek help before it was too late.","celebrities, death, news, vol 56 issue 05, entertainment"
69,Lin-Manuel Miranda: 'You People Are Giving Me Too Much Fucking Money',"NEW YORK'Noting the fat paychecks he'd received for his work on Broadway and in Hollywood, Hamilton star Lin-Manuel Miranda announced Thursday that 'You people are giving me too much fucking money.' 'Holy hell, I wrote one musical about a founding father, and you goddamn lunatics are throwing millions of dollars at me like I invented theater or something. Get a grip,' said Miranda, who wondered aloud if Disney would still have paid $75 million to acquire the rights to his play, Hamilton, if they knew he'd 'shit it out in one night after reading the dude's biography.' 'Why am I getting paid to go on late-night shows and freestyle with the host? Or voice a cartoon character in an episode of some animated show? I'm touched you all liked the rap songs, but stop with the big bucks because it's getting embarrassing. I'm just one guy in an entire industry of people struggling to make any money at all.' Miranda urged anyone who wanted to give him more money to instead 'throw some cash at whoever wrote Wicked because that shit is incredible.'","money, celebrities, #theater, news, vol 56 issue 05, entertainment"

72,Director Sets Up Actor With Backstory About How Franchise Failing Horribly,"LOS ANGELES'While shooting the second installment in a planned three-part film adaptation of a popular book series, director Marshall Callins reportedly provided actor Grant Simms with an elaborate backstory about how the first movie in the franchise was a complete financial and critical failure. 'So in this next scene, your motivation is the fact that this franchise is poised to become one of the biggest commercial disasters in recent studio history unless we can recoup millions of dollars in losses,' said Callins, encouraging Simms to delve more deeply into his knowledge of the first installment's disastrous performance at the box office, poor overseas growth, and underwhelming reception by fans in order to fully internalize the sense that everything was riding on this. 'Think back to that critical moment in time when the producers said, 'If this thing isn't a hit, it's going to destroy every single one of your careers.' How did that blunt ultimatum make you feel? Everything you say and do should be informed by the fact that if we bomb opening weekend, you'll never be trusted to carry another major film.' At press time, sources confirmed the director had provided additional guidance by hinting to the actor of a future in which he is forced to resort to commercial work.","movies, news, vol 56 issue 05, entertainment"

'According to our research, there's no possible explanation as to what a divine deity could even offer that would appeal to a multimillionaire like Justin Bieber,' said Dr. Frederick Tanner, who noted that the pop star has continued to proclaim his faith in God over the years despite the fact that every album he's ever released has easily shot straight to the top of the charts. 'Look, we're researchers. We make next to nothing. God could help us, so it makes sense that we believe in God. But this guy is 25 years old and lives in a huge mansion. He performs sold-out shows before thousands of screaming fans every night. Frankly, it's foolish to believe in an interventionist God when you already have everything you could want.'

'This award is long overdue. From its contributions to Indian classical music, to Gregorian chant, to modern-day hip-hop, it's difficult to overstate the seminal contributions the Treble Clef has made to our art form.'

'It's just kind of pathetic; the guy kept talking about how he loves Billie Eilish, but it's like, okay, she dropped 'Ocean Eyes' four years ago,' said 21-year-old Australian singer-songwriter Mallrat, adding that while Malone seemed harmless, his constant attempts to drop the fact that he'd opened for Justin Bieber in 2015 weren't making him seem any younger. 'It's sad, but honestly, I couldn't stop laughing when old-ass Kanye came over, grabbed him by the shoulders, and told us that they collaborated on 'Fade' together. It's like, dude, you're almost in your mid-twenties, and everybody can tell that you don't know who Lil Nas X is. Maybe you should go hang out with Grandma Swift instead.'

'I swear, the Recording Academy is just shamelessly pandering to a general consensus held by a majority of Americans about what constitutes good music,' said local awards-show viewer Ross Faust, who complained that by recognizing Post Malone and Lizzo while it neglected other, lesser-known names, the Grammys was showcasing its prejudice against artists most people haven't listened to and almost no one cares about. 'I don't get it. I've barely heard any of these songs outside of radio, bars, stores, clubs, commercials, and blockbuster movies. The fact that millions of people have listened to them constantly and developed emotional connections to them just doesn't seem like a criterion that should be used to decide what constitutes the best music of the era.'

Proof that overnight success is possible seven years after your debut album. Grammy voters hope giving the award to Lana Del Rey's album will make up for their notorious refusal to award a Grammy to Norman Rockwell during his life.

Billie Eilish's smash hit showed music fans that whispering isn't dead. Look, Michelle Obama reading her book into a microphone is obviously going to win, but what's our definition of 'album,' here, exactly?

84,,"NEW YORK'In a passionate rebuttal to the many graphic accounts of sexual assault and rape leveled at her client, attorney Donna Rotunno delivered a forceful argument Friday imploring the trial's jurors to keep in mind how fun disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein's 1994's Pulp Fiction was. 'Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I'd like to ask you not to forget that without my client's help, Pulp Fiction would have never been made'you remember what a good time Pulp Fiction was, right?' said Rotunno, who went on to emphasize to jurors that the Oscar-winning crime caper's snappy dialogue and whip-smart pop culture references represented the best that Hollywood had to offer, before urging them to honestly recall what a blast they had watching indelible performances like Uma Thurman and John Travolta's turn in the Jack Rabbit Slim's restaurant or Bruce Willis's work in that 'whole gimp basement shootout.' 'You're going to hear a lot of wild claims about my client's alleged behavior, but none of that should distract you from the issue hand: Samuel L. Jackson is absolutely unforgettable in his climactic redemption scene. You know that, I know that, and anyone denying that is just fooling themselves.' After concluding her statement, Rotunno went on to raise an objection to the lead prosecutor's assertion that the Weinstein-produced Jackie Brown was actually pretty standard crime fare and really dragged in the second act due to its glut of forgettable boilerplate characters.","harvey weinstein, movies, sexual assault, crime, news, vol 56 issue 03, entertainment"

'Sure, right now the biggest thing in the world seems like it's how I've spent the past week getting pregnant, losing my best friend to a mysterious illness, filing for divorce, and then accidentally killing my teenage daughter, but soon enough this will just be a brief clip that provides some much-needed dramatic context before a new episode begins,' said Worthington, taking a deep breath in her living room and reminding herself that despite how overwhelmed she currently felt by the sight of splattered blood and her child's dead body on the floor, it would probably barely even register as a blip in a few weeks when it was used as merely one of several rapid-cut scenes compiled to help viewers understand the show's larger narrative tapestry. 'This is exactly what happened when I had an affair with my son's soccer coach. First, I couldn't stop freaking out, but now that we're a few seasons down the line, the two-second excerpt of me putting a hand on his chest and saying, 'We shouldn't be doing this,' isn't even the climactic part of the recaps. Frankly, once this whole dealing-with-loss arc runs out, I don't think they'll include any mention at all of the many untimely deaths that have befallen my friends and family members.' Worthington added that, in contrast, she was sure the recent revelation that she possessed dark powers and could transform herself into a cat would be a key part of any recap for years to come.","tv, news, vol 56 issue 03, entertainment"

'There's a bunch of movies, as well as full first seasons of other shows, but for some reason the only episode of the The Blacklist they have is some random one from 2016,' said a confused Grant, speculating that the airline may have a strange deal with the show's production company or that perhaps some other airline has the rest of the streaming rights, since it's the sixth episode in the season and he knows for a fact that the show is serialized and meant to be watch sequentially. 'I was like, oh, nice, I've been meaning to check out The Blacklist, but then all they have to watch is an episode called 'The Thrushes,' which isn't even from the show's most recent season. Maybe it's a technical glitch or something that allowed it to slip through? I mean, it also seems like it's only available in Spanish.' At press time, Grant decided he would just watch Season 3, Episode 9 of Angie Tribeca, which was also available for viewing.","travel, tv, news, vol 56 issue 03, entertainment"

'It's the same thing every year: We'll be saying grace, Trent will refuse to bow his head, and then the rest of the meal is him going on and on about how Christianity was developed as a system of mind control and we're all brainwashed,' said Reznor's uncle, Clyde Reznor, who joked that it was almost a family tradition watching the 54-year-old Oscar-winning songwriter and composer slouch in the pews at Christmas Eve mass and cough the word 'liar' into his fist during the priest's homily.

'Whether it's a retelling of the classic redemptive story of his heart growing three sizes, some new adventure exploring his relationship to Valentine's Day, or a prequel explaining the history of Mount Crumpit, we will consume it ravenously as soon as it's produced.

'Honestly, I think the end result didn't turn out so bad at all,' said Darnell, stressing that the widely panned sight of Taylor Swift, Jason Derulo, and James Corden as computer-generated cats singing and dancing through London alleyways represented three grueling years of his life. 'For months, I stayed up late rendering textures to make sure the whiskers looked just right on the face of [Idris Elba's character] Macavity. That was hard, all right? And when I was finally finished, I was so proud that I showed my wife some of the concept art. I don't know.

'I'm really of two minds about this, because on the one hand, he said the new movie fails to live up to the original trilogy, which makes me at least want to throw a brick through his window with a note telling him to watch his back,' said Ariely, confirming he had already drafted an eight-page-long death threat to Stan Corimer of the website Screen-On Time, but had not yet decided whether to post it to the reviewer's Facebook page. 'On the other hand, though, he commended J.J. Abrams' skillful pacing and faithfulness to George Lucas' vision, which makes me wonder if I should just call the whole thing off. Now, I really don't feel like camping outside his house for hours. Maybe I could go with a response that's somewhere in between, like, threatening to kill his dog but not everyone in his whole family? I don't know. This is a tough one.'

'In order to avoid forcing people to relive the trauma of 9/11, we are working with a graphics team to remove the Twin Towers from all the background shots of United 93 for the upcoming remastered release,' said Greengrass, explaining that for many Americans the World Trade Center buildings were a distressing symbol of the tragic attacks of 9/11 and failing to digitally delete the structures from the Manhattan skyline would distract from the film's human story of overcoming challenging obstacles. 'I mean, sure, historically speaking, the towers should be there, but keeping them in would unintentionally make the terrorist hijackings of that day a focal point of the story, which is the last thing I want, as the film has nothing to do with them. In the new version, the skyline will be altered to not include the WTC and the planes will safely travel to their destinations without a hitch, which I hope will provide audiences with a much more comfortable viewing experience.' Greengrass told reporters that the measure came in the wake of similar decisions by the directors of Fahrenheit 9/11, World Trade Center, and 25th Hour.","movies, news, vol 55 issue 51, entertainment"

115,Frozen 2' Creators Confirm That Elsa Gay But Also Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminist,"BURBANK, CA'Responding at last to rumors surrounding the beloved animated character, Frozen 2 co-directors Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee confirmed Thursday that Elsa is gay but also a trans-exclusionary radical feminist. 'We're excited to finally share with fans that Queen Elsa is indeed Disney's first lesbian princess as well as an anti-transgender activist,' said Lee, who noted that the sequel contains a scene where Elsa scolds anthropomorphic snowman Olaf for following her into the bathroom and demands he discloses his gender. 'We understand that representation is important, not just of sexuality but of opinions, too. We're confident that fans across the political spectrum will find something they can identify in Frozen 2. Elsa may not be a perfect character, but she is three-dimensional. And that's what makes for magical storytelling.' At press time, Lee hinted that a Frozen 3 project would explore Anna's controversial views on sex workers.","disney, movies, news, vol 55 issue 47, entertainment"

'We are working hard to resolve user issues involving the new Disney Plus system, and extend a sincere thank you to the recluses, misfits, and deeply lonely adults for your patience at this time,' said Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger in an official statement, saying that any error messages customers were experiencing were due to the company not properly anticipating what profound depths of sadness some full-grown human beings are capable of reaching. 'We recognize that many people were looking forward to Disney Plus's launch in the most pitiful way imaginable. The entire Walt Disney Company family and I would like to personally acknowledge your frustration with the only thing that can give you'not happiness, quite, but some vague form of contentment despite thousands of years' worth of other art and entertainment options to turn to. We apologize for the fact that these silly children's programs are the only thing in your woeful and, frankly, distressing existence.'

'While Disney's back catalog is obviously pretty extensive, the opportunity to stream every tennis match broadcast in the history of television was simply too good to pass up,' said Cleveland resident Caroline Santos, who, according to sources, was just one among many thousands of consumers who scrambled to cancel their pre-ordered Disney Plus memberships after the new streaming platform Tennis Channel Unlimited became available this morning. 'Disney Plus has most of the Marvel stuff and some new shows that look promising, but if I'm going to pay $6.99 a month, I'd much rather be able to binge-watch hundreds and hundreds of hours of tennis. Having access to the 1979 Australian Open semifinals whenever and wherever we want is something my whole family will appreciate.' At press time, the Walt Disney Company announced it had acquired the Tennis Channel for $80.5 billion.","disney, tv, business, internet!, news, vol 55 issue 46, entertainment"

'Oh no, the pain is excruciating'what is happening to me?' said the iconic 1950s film star, who reportedly began wailing and disintegrating into dust as angels and seraphim tried vainly to hold onto him at the exact moment that a Hollywood special effects director pressed 'enter' on his rendering software. 'Why, oh why? What did I do to deserve this? Save me! Someone! Anyone! Oh, Jesus, it hurts, it hurts so badly.'

'For certain children, awareness of threats posed by the Wheel Of Fortune host can be crucial to development, and that's where Leo comes in,' said head writer Sue Rawson, who noted that the new Muppet's fun sing-along songs were created to help kids improve in a number of cognitive areas, including identifying the shadows where Sajak lurks and knowing which letters of the alphabet are actually the television personality's demonic servants. 'We have Leo pacing the studio apartment where he lives alone, opening cabinets, clutching at tuna cans and shouting 'Aha!' to emphasize the truth that nowhere is truly safe from Pat Sajak. For added realism, we've given Leo a neighbor who comes by from time to time to check on him and make sure he's taking his prescribed antipsychotic medications.' A press release from Children's Television Workshop also noted that Leo will be instructing young viewers on how to properly duct tape their toilets shut to ensure Sajak is unable to slither out during the night and steal their food while they sleep.","sesame street, tv, news, vol 55 issue 44, entertainment"

'I sort of don't want to part with my only memento from my time on that set, but I really need the cash,' said Damon, noting that other than a grape fruit juice stain on its left sleeve, the jacket was in near-mint condition and should sell for 'way more' given its connection to a real Hollywood movie. 'I had assumed there would be a bidding war or something, but almost no one bit. And I was banking on using the cash from this to cover my acting classes.

'It's really hard watching a talented person undergo something as humiliating as that commercial, so some of us decided to pitch in and help her out with what we can only assume is crushing medical debt,' said Colorado native Henry Graff, 48, adding that he and other fans of the Academy Award winner collected funds through a Kickstarter campaign in the hopes that Theron, who has starred in dozens of major films over the past 20 years, would be able to stave off personal bankruptcy. 'You see something like this and it's a huge red flag, because you realize something terrible must have happened to make a successful actor like her agree to appear in such an awful ad. Whatever medical condition has put her in dire straits'be it cancer, addiction, or a nervous breakdown'we're not going to judge. We just want to help. I honestly can't imagine what she must be going through right now.'

'Producers have been laying the groundwork for high-intensity drama since practically the first episode, and it's thrilling that they're finally paying that off by debuting a meaningful conflict that audiences can invest in,' said viewer Rich Nichols, expressing his hope that the upcoming episodes would continue delivering shocking, unexpected twists by playing with the audience expectations of caring about characters' stated goals. 'They've dropped hints throughout the previous two seasons that dramatic stakes exist within the universe of this show, but until now, there have only been a few small glimpses, so it's going to be pretty awesome to finally see a character with a strong need who faces obstacles in an effort to achieve their objective.'

'In these highly PC times, there's no way a classic picture like the Zapruder film would ever get off the ground,' said Loud, telling reporters that the influential and celebrated 1963 film would almost certainly be decried as offensive and overly violent by today's social justice warriors. 'We just live in a day and age where censorship is the norm and everyone is dying to be outraged, so as soon as audiences got one look at John F. Kennedy's head exploding, the blue checkmark Twitter mob would've probably driven Abe Zapruder out of town on a rail.'

'With a name like Addams, I just assumed this was going to be a traditional all-American family, but now I find myself wondering if they aren't all just a little bit off in some way,' said Piebenga, noting that each person living in the sprawling Gothic home seemed to have tastes, appearances, and personality quirks that were unusual compared with what you might ordinarily see. 'I can't quite put my finger on it. The mother seemed kind of normal at first, if maybe a little too beautiful, but that cousin of theirs is way, way out there.

'From the moment he approached the booth and sought admission to our first screening of the movie, we knew this was a deeply disturbed individual,' employee Jennifer Mendoza said of the unidentified middle-aged male, who, with unsettling statements like 'One adult for the 7:25 p.m. showing, please' and 'I hear Will Smith's great in this,' immediately caught the attention of security. 'Once his ticket was torn and he made his way toward the theater where Gemini Man is playing, we realized this was a very serious situation and immediately contacted the authorities. Thankfully, the showing is completely empty apart from this one suspicious person, so any damage inflicted will be minimal. Still, it's scary to think there are people like this out there.' At press time, local police were seen dragging the patron out of the theater after he had escalated concerns by staying to watch the film's closing credits.","movies, news, vol 55 issue 41, entertainment"

'The individuals in question are in a state of constant anger and dissatisfaction, frustrated to be living in a world that does not honor the crown,' read the bulletin in part, outlining how the FBI had discovered the plots while monitoring pro-monarchy dark-web forums where members posted about how seeing people like themselves onscreen who believed in divine right had inspired them to restore power to the throne through violence. 'We fear that the themes of largesse and elitism depicted in this film may radicalize these people. While the FBI intends to deploy a select amount of undercover police officers dressed as servants to screenings, we advise theater employees and attendees alike to keep an eye out for suspiciously fancy activity by individuals in tails or top hats.

'The death of this minor character 10 minutes into the first episode was supposed to be the inciting incident that brings together this quirky group of friends who all meet up at his funeral,' said series executive producer George Shapiro, adding that test audiences greatly enjoyed the rapport between the character and his neighbor, Kramer, but responded negatively when Jerry was brutally gunned down in a diner on Manhattan's Upper West Side. 'As it turned out, viewers really liked Jerry's clever observations about human nature and the sarcastic remarks he made in reaction to his friends' many foibles, so we decided to give the character a greatly expanded role. Once the writers discovered the actor who played Jerry also performed stand-up, it just made sense to incorporate that into the show as well. The rest is television history!' Shapiro went on to note that when the pilot was rewritten, the series became much more of a comedy, moving away from the original concept of a gritty police procedural featuring hard-bitten homicide detective George Costanza.","tv, news, vol 55 issue 40, entertainment"

'Tom probably needs to be more realistic about the expectations he's placing on his body in middle age.

'Botox and the entire Allergan family sincerely express their regrets over our ill-advised 'Millie: Not Getting Any Younger' campaign, and wholeheartedly admit that, after conferring with concerned consumers including many of Millie's fans, we now see that it was inappropriate,' company spokesperson Brenton Saunders said of the $1.3 million campaign that included spreads in Cosmopolitan, Elle, Vogue, Marie Claire, and dozens of billboards'all in a 7-mile radius of the teen's residence'depicting a marked-up image of potential problem areas on Brown's face, implying that her career could really take off if she got some work done. 'We see now how these ads could be seen as perpetuating a culture of beauty that preys on the insecurities of young women, which is patently unhealthy, regardless of how much they could stand to even out some of those laugh lines. At any rate, we believe Ms. Brown is beautiful just the way she is and will be so for at least the next five years, give or take.'

'You're presented, at first, with what looks like the beginning of a normal day, but then, bam! Not even five minutes in, there's some ludicrous incident involving an out-of-proportion personal reaction from somebody that creates high stakes for everyone involved. I'd be constantly frustrated if I were one of them. Their lives must be unusually stressful.'

'Without giving too much away, I'll say there's a 10-story plunge into a pit of real lava, a nipple-clipped adventure through an alternate dimension, and a food court serving a wide range of inedible toxic treats.

'It's unfortunate that even a frame-by-frame breakdown of the Frozen sequel's trailer offered almost no additional insights into Trump possibly using military funds to blackmail Ukraine's president to investigate Joe Biden,' said Frozen fan Lara Hadden, complaining that despite indications that the Disney film would feature beloved characters such as Elsa, Anna, and Olaf, there were virtually no specific details about Trump pressuring Ukraine to undermine his political rival and aid his reelection bid. 'Even a close reading between the lines of Elsa and company entering the enchanted forest that has been overtaken by dark forces still provides very little evidence as to whether the communications Trump had with the foreign power amounted to treason. They make it clear that Elsa is determined to discover the origin of her magical powers, but unfortunately, they play things pretty close to the vest as to whether this incident rises to the level of an impeachable offense.' At press time, the film's creators urged fans to keep their eyes peeled, hinting that many easter eggs about Trump's foreign communications remained undiscovered throughout the trailer.","movies, donald trump, news, vol 55 issue 39, entertainment"

170,Panicked Ken Burns Worried He In Too Deep With 17-Trillion-Hour 'The Universe' Documentary,"WALPOLE, NH'As he shuffled through the pages of one of the 463 x 1018 primary resources he has assembled thus far, an overwhelmed Ken Burns reported Monday that he may have gotten in over his head when he agreed to produce a 17-trillion-hour documentary for PBS titled The Universe. 'It's definitely a lot more work than I anticipated, especially considering I'm only 0.000000001 seconds into the Big Bang so far,' said the visibly frazzled documentarian as he began screening a three-year-long clip from the film, which is set to be an in-depth look at the entirety of the cosmos, including history, science, arts, culture, and the grand design of all existence. 'I'm really stressed out that some of the great stuff I have about multiverses, gravitational waves, the development of consciousness, amphibian reproduction, the Ottoman Empire, 19th-century Shaker furniture-making, the history of hydrogen, and feudalism will wind up on the cutting-room floor, because there just won't be room for it all. Still, it's been fun revisiting some of my favorite subjects, like baseball and the national parks, since they'll be a part of this film. I just rewatched The Civil War, so we can do an episode about that, along with an additional episode about me making my documentary about it.' PBS confirmed The Universe was set to air in October 2104, when viewers will be able to have the film streamed directly into a neural implant via their preferred biochip technology or purchase a limited edition 8.5-trillion-DVD box set.","ken burns, news, vol 55 issue 38, entertainment"

'It's gotten so bad that I can't even go out to eat with my family without being interrupted by another crazed Home Alone fanatic,' said Pesci, noting that he is typically more than happy to pose with fans as long as they wait until he's done eating. 'Don't get me wrong, I'm flattered to have acted in a scene that resonates with so many people from all backgrounds and generations, but Christ, some days I think if I see another blowtorch, my head's gonna explode. There is a limit to how many skin grafts a guy should have to suffer for his fans.' Pesci added that he wished more people would ask for pictures in which they bludgeoned him with a baseball bat before burying him alive into a shallow cornfield grave.","celebrities, fans, news, vol 55 issue 36, entertainment"
174,Kim Kardashian Tries To Escape L.A. In Rowboat After Realizing Past 12 Years Of Life Have Been TV Show,"LOS ANGELES'As a team of producers stood on the shore and begged her to reconsider, Kim Kardashian West reportedly rowed a boat out into the Pacific Ocean on Thursday in an attempt to escape Los Angeles, having discovered the past dozen years of her life have all been part of a television show.  Sources close to Kardashian West said she had behaved erratically in recent months, often ducking out of rooms to avoid interactions with her co-stars and asking panicked questions about certain people who appeared to be following her. Last night, she is believed to have stumbled upon a call sheet inadvertently left behind by E! network staff and labeled Keeping Up With The Kardashians. Seeing her own name among the cast members likely confirmed her worst fears, causing her to flee her Hidden Hills home, where this morning a production assistant found only a mannequin in a latex pink mini-dress beneath the covers where she was presumed to be sleeping.  'Everywhere I went, everything I did, the cameras were rolling,' said Kardashian West, who shouted above the din of waves crashing around her rowboat as she revealed that her suspicions had begun six months ago when a shotgun microphone fell 'out of nowhere' and landed in her 60-foot infinity pool. 'All my relationships were built on artifice. All my friends and family'they were just actors and celebrities. The whole thing was staged, put on by a bunch of Hollywood executives who turned my life into a show for millions to watch.'  'I always felt like people treated me differently and could never put my finger on why all the attention was always on me, but now I know,' she continued. 'My entire life has been a lie.'  Pulling back on the oars of her small boat and leaving the Malibu Pier behind, Kardashian West expounded on how her life had been beset by a series of strange coincidences, including her mother marrying a famous Olympian and her convenient friendship with TV stars like Paris Hilton, which she had never before put much stock in but now suddenly made sense.  According to reports, the producers went to great lengths to prevent Kardashian West from discovering the artificial nature of her life, even staging a sudden illness for her 2-year-old son last year after she expressed a desire to move to Costa Rica to get out of the spotlight. They are said to have grown especially concerned in March after the 38-year-old accidentally overheard a conversation in which her co-stars Kourtney and Khloé Kardashian had broken character, causing her to complain that no one in her family understood her. In response, network officials reportedly attempted to distract Kardashian West with the prospect of appearing in more workout videos or launching another signature fragrance.  'I always thought it was weird that as soon as I told my family that I wanted to be a nurse, there was a horrific motorcycle accident right in front of my house, because after that I couldn't stand the sight of blood and had to abandon my dream,' Kardashian West said as the coastline faded in the distance and lightning-flecked storm clouds gathered above her, following her boat regardless of which way she turned. 'It's all starting to add up now. That's why people kept telling me to make sure the labels on the products I was using were always visible. And when that wildfire was threatening our house last year, it wound up conveniently passing us by, didn't it?'  'It makes me wonder if L.A. is even a real city,' she added. 'It seems like everything was built just for someone like me.'  Witnesses confirmed Kardashian West's escape toward the ocean was beset by obstacles, with dozens of cars crashing in front of her and roads suddenly shut down for construction. As she reached the dock and climbed into the boat, sources reported the booming voice of Keeping Up With The Kardashians creator Ryan Seacrest spoke from a hidden loudspeaker and begged her to stay, but to no avail.  'Everyone around me automatically smiles and compliments me as if they were robots or something,' said Kardashian West, gazing out over the horizon as the storm suddenly subsided. 'It's no way to live. God, I should have known. In real life, no mom would ever give all five of her daughters 'K' names. That's so ridiculous and obviously made up. Well, I want a real life. I'm ready for it.'  At press time, an exhausted Kardashian West had reportedly stopped rowing for a moment to contemplate her decision, only to have her boat bump up against a perfectly clear glass barrier.","kim kardashian, celebrities, tv, news, vol 55 issue 36, entertainment"

176,New Even Bleaker 'Joker' Reboot Features Elderly Comic Book Villain Struggling To Care For Wife After Stroke,"HOLLYWOOD'Revealing that the upcoming reboot would provide a chance to explore the darkest aspects of the iconic character, producers announced Wednesday that filming had begun on an even bleaker Joker movie featuring the comic book villain as an elderly man struggling to care for his wife after she has a stroke. 'We're excited to give audiences the chance to see The Joker as they've never seen him before'washing, feeding, and caring for his longtime life partner after she suffers a massive brain hemorrhage in the film's first act,' DC Films president Walter Hamada told reporters, noting that the studio believed longtime fans and newcomers alike would be captivated by the gritty realism of The Clown Prince Of Crime silently weeping in his small, squalid Gotham City apartment when he realizes his dwindling social security check won't be enough to cover his wife's medical bills. 'We couldn't have asked for a better Joker than Bruce Dern, who is bringing depth and pathos to the supervillain never before captured on film. Fans may never look at The Joker the same way again after they see his arthritic hands straining to dab blood away from his wife's forehead after she slips in the bathtub. We've seen The Joker embrace chaos in numerous films, but they've never seen him forced to confront the chaos of his own life with a loved one who no longer recognizes his makeup-covered face.' Hamada added that the reboot would be followed by a new Batman film that finds the caped crusader serving time in Blackgate Penitentiary for helping working-class Gotham women get illegal abortions.","movies, news, vol 55 issue 36, entertainment"

'It's my constitutional right to protect myself with the numerous guns I keep within arm's reach at all times during the broadcast of this show,' said McCain, telling her View co-hosts they simply couldn't understand the perspective of everyday Americans who need a gun taped under every table, chair, and craft services tray around them just to feel safe. 'Every citizen should be allowed to quickly access a sidearm and discharge as many rounds as necessary to neutralize a threat that, God forbid, might one day emerge from our audience, crew, or co-hosts. Whether we're doing the 'Hot Topics' segment or an interview with Emma Stone, I deserve the comfort of knowing I'm a button-press away from having a Sig Sauer M400 drop from a secret compartment and into my hands so I can defend my liberty. That's what the Second Amendment is all about.' McCain also warned that 'there's going to be a lot of violence' if people continue to talk about taking away her job.","meghan mccain, guns, tv, news, vol 55 issue 36, entertainment"

'Yeah, frankly, I think they stopped being good right around the self-titled debut, and everything since then has just gotten progressively worse,' said the self-described Weezer diehard, adding that he sincerely missed the 'old Weezer' from before Scott Shriner, Patrick Wilson, Brian Bell, and Rivers Cuomo joined the band. 'Obviously, I love these guys, but I remember seeing the 'Buddy Holly' video back in the early nineties and realizing, 'Man, these guys suck now.' And then Pinkerton really hammered home that they were never coming back. At this point, they've released, like, 13 bad albums in a row and I barely remember why I liked them in the first place.' Staples also noted that he still thought Rivers Cuomo's time as a middle school student without musical training held up as strongly as ever.","music, news, vol 55 issue 35, entertainment"

'I understand that as a piece of fiction there is a reasonable suspension of belief expected, but they think I'm gonna buy that he hasn't looked out the window once, even on accident, all while his wife's murder is being investigated?'

'When I arrived at the studio to record 'My Generation,' Roger Daltrey pulled me aside to say that a fellow called Keith Moon would be playing my part instead, and the rest is history,' said Best, who described a long career of fateful coincidences, such as the time being asked to leave an early version of Jefferson Airplane led to an incredible opportunity to get canned by The Mamas & The Papas. 'I actually learned to play guitar for Cream, and when they kicked me out and brought in Eric Clapton, that was when I finally, at long last, had enough free time to start a project of my own. That band turned out great. They're called Crosby, Stills and Nash now.' Asked what he hoped would be his greatest legacy as a musician, Best responded that he expected future generations would always remember him as the sixth Temptation.","music, celebrities, news, vol 55 issue 33, entertainment"

Kelly as a beloved abuser from the 1990s with the reality of him being a reviled abuser in the 2010s. 'In my head, he's still the R. Kelly I grew up with, the guy who wrote 'I Believe I Can Fly' and had already been sued for impregnating an underage girl,' said Allen, who confirmed he longed for those simpler times, years ago, when all you knew about the R&B artist was that he made great records and had demonstrated a well-documented pattern of predatory sexual behavior with children. 'I have all these great memories of seeing him on TV back then, when he was accepting Grammys, appearing in groundbreaking music videos, and going on trial in Chicago for making child pornography. Now it feels like those memories have been tarnished.' Allen added that while he is horrified by Kelly's crimes, there are a few songs from back in the day when everybody knew what the singer was getting up to that he still loves.","r. kelly, music, sexual abuse, news, vol 55 issue 32, entertainment"

'We could no longer in good conscience continue distributing this film after watching secret video footage, which showed the production company inflicting cruel physical punishment on dozens of cars, breaking windows, smashing headlights, and repeatedly slamming the poor vehicles against walls,' said Universal Pictures president Jimmy Horowitz, promising that the studio would not tolerate the vicious abuse endured by the Corvettes, Mustangs, and Broncos prominently featured throughout the movie. 'Learning that these beautiful cars were subjected to such inhumane working conditions made me sick to my stomach. This cannot stand. Audiences deserve a fun action movie, not the reckless endangerment of innocent vehicles, many of which were less than a year old. Unfortunately, there's evidence that many of the actors were very rough with these cars, forcing them off cliffs and ramming them with trucks. I'll never forget the sight of a battered Aston Martin with a busted axle that they just abandoned in the middle of nowhere.' At press time, the film's director David Leith denied accusations that the production cruelly kept cars locked inside hot, dark spaces with poor ventilation and little room to move.","movies, news, vol 55 issue 31, entertainment"

'Our new Platinum Lux Pass allows individuals who have absolutely no place in a hot, crowded music festival like Lollapalooza to come here anyway without ever having to deal with the hassle of hearing music or getting anywhere close to the crowd,' said Charlie Jones, co-owner of the festival, noting that for only $5,000 per day attendees would be able to skip the entry lines entirely and instead be whisked directly into a climate-controlled, insulated room that had been expressly designed for people who don't want to hear live music and almost certainly should not be here. 'Whether you're too sensitive to sound to conceivably enjoy the experience of listening to music for hours on end or you're a new parent who realizes taking their overheated child to the festival was an enormous mistake, the Platinum Lux Pass makes sure you can come to Lollapalooza without once hearing a band or encountering anything resembling a music festival experience.' Jones added that an add-on for $500 would allow guests to have a Lollapalooza volunteer drape a tarp over them the moment they entered the venue so they would never have to interact with any of the other people in the Platinum Lux Tent.","music, news, vol 55 issue 31, entertainment"

'What really sets Lil Nas X apart is his ingenious choice to create what I'm calling the 'country' genre, a completely novel kind of music that combines traditional American genres with a certain level of southern twang,' said Rolling Stone writer Will Hermes, adding that what made 'Old Town Road' such a massive hit was Lil Nas X's revolutionary choice to use the song's lyrics to touch on little-used Americans themes such as cowboys, tractors, and horses, while layering them with folksy instrumentation like banjos to create an entirely new sound. 'You can really imagine this 'country music' appealing to Americans everywhere, from the rural south to the heartland. Time will tell, of course. It might just be a passing fad.' Hermes said that he already saw several virtual unknowns like Keith Urban and Billy Ray Cyrus jumping onto the bandwagon of Lil Nas X's new genre with their own country-inspired recordings.","music, news, vol 55 issue 31, entertainment"

'After months of inquiry, analysis, music theory breakdowns, interviews with those closest to the writer and composer, and listening to the song ourselves and paying attention to how it made us feel inside, we can say with complete confidence that Chris Martin was probably feeling pretty down when he created the melody to 'Fix You,' and may have even gotten all choked up,' said lead researcher Yvette Daniels in a summary of the study's findings, the conclusion of which was derived from a statistical simulation run over 80 times, nearly all of which determined that Martin had no choice but to bawl his eyes out at crucial points of the song's creation process. 'One especially detailed analysis suggested a roughly 90% probability that, while first conceiving the lyrics 'Lights will guide you home/And I will try to fix you,' a single tear dropped from Martin's left eye onto the keys of his piano, where it reflected a perfect image of the room's single candle. Seriously, just listen to it. This guy was definitely all torn up inside about something.' Popular music scholars are claiming the study's findings represent one of the field's greatest discoveries since the groundbreaking 1995 study that confirmed that Alanis Morisette was very, very mad and stomped her feet when she wrote 'You Oughta Know.'","music, celebrities, news, vol 55 issue 31, entertainment"

'We were working with the top cardigan guy in Hollywood, and he spent months taking molds of my torso so he could build a sweater that would look as realistic as possible on screen.

'As soon as the video for the pride anthem opened with a close shot of Taylor's face, my heart stopped and I thought, 'That's me,'' said Bowman, who explained how watching the artist use LGBTQ iconography to advance her career empowered the 17-year-old to arrive at an epiphany about wresting a movement out of marginalized people's hands and into her own. 'For my whole life, I've lived in shame and fear about the mere idea of making Pride Month about me. People always tried to tell me that I should let others speak for themselves, that they should control their own narratives. They even told me that I was 'confused.'

'It's a national embarrassment that someone as bigoted and idiotic as Trump was able to parlay his flagging celebrity into such tremendous political success when our own attempts to do so have left us scooping up the crumbs,' said Milano, speaking on behalf of a coalition made up of Jon Cryer, Kathy Griffin, Michael Ian Black, and others that seeks to push back against the broken system that allowed Trump to rekindle his once-fading star. 'Something is wrong when a washed-up, narcissistic reality TV star can become the most powerful man on earth and we're still stuck on the bottom rung of the political-influence circuit, unable to recapture the fame of our early years. He saw the climate was conducive to building a personal brand around people's outrage, and he did it way faster than any of us could. It's sickening.' The assembled celebrities closed their remarks by urging those in attendance to act against 'the gravest threat the country has ever faced' by following them on social media and checking out some of their anti-Trump rants.","celebrities, donald trump, news, vol 55 issue 24, entertainment"
216,Atlantic Records Sends Cease-And-Desist Order To Woman Using Lizzo's 'Juice' As Her Personal Anthem,"LOS ANGELES'Saying that the legal action should serve as a stern warning to all those who exploit the hard work of musicians, Atlantic Records sent an official cease-and-desist order Thursday to a local woman, 28-year-old Ana Sanchez, accused of using Lizzo's single 'Juice' as her personal anthem. 'From her insistence on playing it on her headphones every time she enters work to her repeated use of the song in the background of her Instagram stories, this user has blatantly violated Lizzo's intellectual property rights,' said Atlantic Records attorney Denise Ferguson of Sanchez's 'total disregard' for copyright laws by failing to pay the licensing fees required to claim a song as one's personal anthem. 'Miss Sanchez's co-opting of this song for her personal brand is completely unacceptable. If she continues to play this song on the treadmill or while getting ready for a date, we will not hesitate to sue. To all those with the audacity to claim our client's song as their own, hear us now: 'Juice' is not, has never been, and will never be 'your jam.' Ferguson went on to suggest that any woman looking for a personal anthem select 'She'll Be Coming 'Round The Mountain' or any of the other hundreds of songs currently in the public domain.","music, news, vol 55 issue 24, entertainment"
217,Panicking Taylor Swift Realizes It Too Late To Call Off Assassination After Katy Perry Makes Peace Offering,"NEW YORK'Her hands shaking as she dialed several numbers written on a piece of paper in an effort to get in touch with the goons she had hired, a panicking Taylor Swift reportedly realized Wednesday that it was too late to call off the assassination of Katy Perry after her longtime rival made a peace offering. 'Shit, shit, shit'Bruno, is that you? Call it off, call it off! Peacock! Peacock! Tell them not to shoot!' the 29-year-old pop star was heard to yell into her cell phone after seeing Perry's Instagram post where her former enemy had tagged her and written 'Peace At Last,' before being told by her contact, 'I am sorry, Ms. Swift, but the die has been cast.' 'Come on, please tell them I don't need them anymore. What do you mean all the fail-safes are no longer possible? Look, I made a mistake. Things have changed, I don't need her to die now. You'll still get your money'I'll double your fee! Please just don't kill her.' At press time, Swift made a last-ditch attempt to forestall the assassination by frantically calling Perry to tell her not to sing 'Swish Swish' at a concert, only to be told that Perry was already onstage and would start the song in five minutes.

220,Agent Asks Failing Actor If He's Considered Becoming Alt-Right Commentator,"LOS ANGELES'Stressing that the career move had done wonders for his other clients, agent Brendon Lourde asked struggling actor Greg Hartley Thursday if he has ever considered getting into some alt-right commentary. 'To be honest with you, I've been getting a ton of hard passes on the booking front, but I think there's some real demand for a middle-aged performer like you to start up a podcast where you, say, tear into political correctness while chatting with a few guests from the alt-right sphere,' said Lourde, stressing that he was just spitballing, but that addressing even one or two tweets to the men's rights movement would drive Hartley's following through the roof, which would pave the way for some 'great synergy' with a comedy special appearing exclusively on Vimeo where he touched on realizing the greatness of Western Civilization after being red-pilled. 'Sure, you might be a little squeamish about claiming shooting victims are crisis actors now. I get that. All I'm saying is that auditions dry up real fast for a guy around your age, and another client of mine made $50,000 last week just from selling shirts that said 'No Homo' over a shot of him flipping off a gay pride march.

'Effective immediately, we will be banning anyone who makes things awkward for the other contestants or the viewers at home by studying up on trivia for months before like total freaks,' said Jeopardy! host Alex Trebek, describing past champions like James Holzhauer and Ken Jennings as exactly the kind of neurotic assholes who turn an enjoyable little daytime game show into a bigger stage to flaunt their obsessive and unsettling level of knowledge on subjects as far-flung as the Russian czars, Caribbean literature, and Rodgers and Hammerstein showtunes. 'It's disturbing for our audience at home to picture these crackpots sitting alone in their pathetic little apartments and reading up on French architects like any of this matters. It doesn't. People just want to kick back and unwind while watching a show after work without some complete lunatic creeping everybody out with a bizarre, all-consuming fixation on winning some dumb trivia competition.' Trebek added that he would personally screen the show's auditions to look for anyone who starts getting one of those 'strange, squirmy grins' on their faces when they know the answer to some clue about Elizabethan English.","jeopardy, tv, news, vol 55 issue 23, entertainment"

'You've been able to handle pretty much everything else we've thrown at you, but these clues might just wipe that fucking smirk off your face,' Trebek said as the studio lights abruptly darkened in tandem with a booming, ominous sound cue, introducing the game's Double Jeopardy categories, which included 'Times James Pissed His Pants,' 'Reasons James' Father Is Disappointed In Him,' and 'How James' Wife Really Feels About Him.' 'Go ahead, smart-ass. Take your pick.' A flustered Holzhauer appeared to be caught off guard when his eighth-grade teacher, recorded remotely at his former middle school, narrated a clue that read, 'James had to start seeking therapy at age 13 after having this done to him regularly by a bully.'

227,Rocketman' Viewers Not Sure Movie Really Needed 45-Minute Princess Diana Death Scene,"LOS ANGELES'Feeling that the scene wasn't completely necessary to tell the famed musician's life story, viewers of the Elton John biopic Rocketman told reporters Thursday they were not entirely convinced the film needed to include a 45-minute scene depicting Princess Diana's death. 'I understand she was a close friend of Elton John and that it was a pivotal moment in his life and career, but to devote that much screen time to a graphic, slow-motion recreation of the car wreck that killed Lady Di seems a little over-the-top,' said local moviegoer Liam Mazolla, who observed that the filmmakers didn't even include John's chart-topping Diana tribute 'Candle In The Wind 1997' in the sequence, but instead drown out all sound with a high-pitched ringing noise as the automobile accident unfolded. 'One moment, you're watching Elton in the studio cutting 'Crocodile Rock,' and the next, it smash-cuts to that fateful car chase 25 years later. It definitely takes some liberties when it shows him arriving at the scene and playing a grand piano on the back of a flatbed truck as the rescue crews get to work. The costumes were great, though.' Viewers also expressed bafflement at the decision to roll the film's credits over Diana's funeral procession, complete footage of which continues for five hours before fading to black.","movies, elton john, princess diana, news, vol 55 issue 22, entertainment"

'My father was a genuine American hero, and it's only right that we honor his departing wish of letting me anchor my own hit daytime talk show called Meghan In The Morning,' said a visibly choked-up McCain, claiming that her father didn't spend five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam just for people to invoke his memory in ways that didn't further her television career whatsoever. 'It's hard not to get emotional when I remember how he held my hand on his deathbed and declared that I deserved to be number one in my time slot. He dreamed about seeing me, and me alone, interview the biggest names in Hollywood and Washington. He's gone now, but if we honor his wishes'as we should'his memory can live on between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. on a major network like ABC, or maybe CBS. It's what he wanted.' McCain also revealed that her father's dying words were, 'Don't accept anything less than a $15 million contract.'","meghan mccain, tv, news, vol 55 issue 22, entertainment"

232,Keanu Reeves Recalls Preparing For 'John Wick 3' By Acting In Two Previous 'John Wick' Films,"LOS ANGELES'Describing his process for bringing the assassin character to life, Keanu Reeves explained to reporters Thursday how he prepared for the title role in John Wick: Chapter 3'Parabellum by acting in the two previous John Wick movies. 'I realized very early on in the development stages of John Wick 3 that the only way to really get into character was to become John Wick for a few months at a time during principal photography on two separate feature-length films whose stories would lead up to this one,' said Reeves, acknowledging that his performance in the latest movie would not have been possible had he not been given the opportunity to fully explore the role by Lionsgate Films and the team that wrote, produced, shot, and released the first and second installments. 'At first, I thought that taking the character's backstory so seriously was maybe a bit pretentious and unnecessary, but the exercise was highly recommended to me by Matt Damon, who used it for The Bourne Ultimatum and loved it, so I thought I should give it a shot. In the end, it's all about what works best for you. Some actors use the Stanislavski or Meisner techniques to build their characters, and others need to be more hands-on by making a couple multimillion-dollar prequels.' Reeves added that he hoped the same method would allow him to turn in a career-defining performance in next year's long-awaited third installment of the Bill & Ted franchise.","keanu reeves, celebrities, movies, news, vol 55 issue 21, entertainment"

235,Actor Who Portrayed The Night King Recalls Challenge Of Playing Character With No Purpose,"BELFAST, NORTHERN IRELAND'Shedding light on the difficult process of believably portraying the Game Of Thrones villain the Night King, actor Vladimir Furdik opened up to reporters Monday about the creative challenge of playing a character with absolutely no purpose whatsoever. 'The Night King was a very demanding role because all my character did was just sort of stand there, so it's on you as the actor to sell his emotions and make up for the fact that he had no narrative function,' said Furdik, explaining that in order to really get into the Night King's mindset, he focused on thinking about ice all day long, a strategy he developed after reading all of George R.R. Martin's books, which provided him with no additional information on how his character actually felt or fit into the series as a whole. 'I kept asking David Benioff and D.B. Weiss if the Night King was going to have any meaningful impact on the story, but they kept dodging the question and telling me to 'look evil.' The scene where my character killed one of the dragons was pretty cool, and I enjoyed getting to flex my acting muscles by pretending to throw a spear. Beyond that, though, all I really did was show up to set in costume. It's tough when your character has no arc, personality, or reason to exist.' Furdik also thanked the cast mates who played Samwell Tarly and Ser Podrick Payne for understanding first-hand the struggle of portraying characters that also had no effect on the series' ultimate conclusion.","game of thrones, tv, news, vol 55 issue 21, entertainment"

'We've ruled out the possibility Ms. Johansson is attracted to Mr. Jost's wealth or status, as she is the highest-paid actress in the world and, unlike her partner, widely admired in her field,' said Columbia sociologist Dana Gourley, adding that researchers were unable to formulate a plausible hypothesis of what the couple even talks about, given that the 'Weekend Update' anchor appears to possess no personality traits that could be deemed interesting or appealing. 'Furthermore, we know her attraction to him can't be merely physical because repeated surveys, facial-symmetry analysis, and other standard metrics confirm Ms. Johansson is dramatically better looking than Mr. Jost. We simply cannot pinpoint what he has to offer her. We have to throw out every scientific model of human attraction ever devised and start over.' Gourley and her colleagues went on to present data showing it would make far more sense for Scarlett Johansson to be engaged to Kevin Nealon or even Norm Macdonald.","scarlett johansson, colin jost, dating, relationships, news, vol 55 issue 21, entertainment"

'During the show's first couple of years, our viewers showed a lot of promise and challenged our assumptions about what a fan base could be,' Benioff told reporters, lamenting the fact that when Game Of Thrones moved past George R.R. Martin's original source material, the show's supporters began to lose coherence and now barely resemble the industry-defining audience they once were. 'At this point, however, they've become a tired cliché. It's hard to watch them lose everything that made us love them in the first place. Nothing they do makes any sense anymore, and it just seems like they want the show to be over with as quickly as possible. It's pretty sad, to be honest.'

238,Bugs Bunny Explains How LeBron Helped Him Get Sober For Role In 'Space Jam' Sequel,"BURBANK, CA'Saying he wanted to thank the four-time NBA MVP for encouraging him to put his dangerous party days behind him, famed Looney Tunes star Bugs Bunny described Thursday how his friend LeBron James helped him get sober for their appearance together in the forthcoming Space Jam sequel. Speaking candidly about his troubled past, the now-recovering rabbit told reporters he owed his life to James, who he said supported him through the darkest moments of his addiction, including multiple incidents in which the All-Star small forward found him passed out and barely breathing in his rabbit hole, surrounded by a pile of half-eaten carrots and a dozen empty jugs labeled 'XXX.' 'After all those decades of drugs, women, and alcohol, I had definitely hit rock bottom,' said a noticeably emotional Bugs Bunny, who, after taking a long drag on a cigarette and letting the smoke puff out of his ears, confirmed he was three weeks sober. 'One time when LeBron found me, I was as good as dead. All I remember is him shaking me and yelling my name, 'Bugs, Bugs!' Then my eyes popped open, spun like slot machines, and landed on three bottles, at which point I vomited coins all over him.' 'No one else wanted to stand up to me because I was a big celebrity,' the Looney Tunes star added. 'But LeBron looked me right in the eyes and asked, 'What's up, doc?''and I could tell he meant it.' The newly clean Hollywood Walk of Fame inductee, who credits James with getting him into rehab, admitted he frequently lashed out on the set of Space Jam 2, at times going so far as to shoot cannons, guns, and rockets at his co-stars, including Blake Griffin, Porky Pig, and Rosario Dawson. According to sources, Bugs Bunny would often storm off the Warner Bros. lot by drunkenly digging underground and tunneling away, only to zigzag out of control and hit lamp posts or mailboxes. Though he ignored the three-time NBA champion's initial offers of help, Bugs Bunny said James finally got through to him with 'a bit of tough love,' telling him, 'You need to shape up,' and then proceeding to compress him into the shape of a ball, jump 10 feet through the air, and dunk him through a basketball hoop. 'That was a wake-up call I'd been waiting for my whole life,' the rabbit said of the incident, adding that the force of James' dunk sent him crashing down through several sets of floors below and somehow lit his tail on fire. 'When I came to, I had a huge lump on my head and there were all these tiny Bugs Bunnies flapping around my head in a circle. Then they stopped, looked at me, and said, 'Bugs, you need help.' And they were right.' 'Everyone else had given up on me, but LeBron, he peeled my flattened body off the floor, stuck a basketball pump in my mouth, and inflated me back to my normal self,' he continued. 'He knew how to get through to me. The last conversation we had before he intervened, I was so hopped up on cocaine that my heart was beating three feet out of my chest and hitting him in the face.' Witnesses on set told reporters the iconic hare suffered multiple relapses during production, straining the relationship of Space Jam 2's top-billed pair. The final straw reportedly came when James threatened to quit the film after Bugs Bunny stumbled onto some railroad tracks while under the influence, stole a handcar, and crashed it into a wall that clearly just had a tunnel painted onto it. 'I wouldn't have blamed him for walking away, but he gave me one more shot,' said the former addict, mentioning that Michael Jordan and Foghorn Leghorn haven't spoken to him since the filming of the first Space Jam, when he was known to shoot up in his trailer with several female rabbits who looked exactly like him but wore makeup and women's clothes. 'Now, for the first time, I'm sober during rabbit season. And I no longer wake up hungover in strange beds, having no idea where I am because I got drunk and forgot to take a left at Albuquerque.' 'When I was at my lowest, I swear I heard the end-credit music of my life start to play and saw those big, red, concentric circles closing in on me,' he added. 'Thanks to LeBron, though, I didn't hear 'Th-th-th-th-that's all folks' or see those words written out in a cursive script. And hopefully, I won't have to for a long, long time.'","lebron james, celebrities, movies, news, vol 55 issue 20, entertainment"

'When our casting agent first brought her in, we had concerns as well, but the more time we spent with Kayla, the more we loved her'and we think you will too.

'Until recently, the polling system on The Voice was a prejudiced anachronism, a relic from an unfortunate period of our history. We no longer live in the dark, backward days of 2011. It's time for a change,' said NBC spokesperson Sarah Simari, explaining that the Founding Showrunners originally believed the only viewers educated and responsible enough to make judgments of vocal performances were respectable upper or middle-class white males who owned property. 'It's about time we recognize that women and minorities can judge an overcooked amateur cover of Nina Simone's 'Feeling Good' just as well as any white man. Hopefully, these new changes will ensure that the winner of the record deal and $100,000 prize will reflect the opinions of free people everywhere.' Representatives of rival network ABC announced they will work on amending the rules of American Idol, which currently counts Lionel Richie's votes as worth three-fifths those of a white person.","tv, news, vol 55 issue 19, entertainment"

'The breathtaking decision to tell this story in a single, uninterrupted shot is brilliant, courageous, and unlike anything I've ever seen before on screen. Absolutely masterful,' said Hollywood Reporter critic Jon Frosch in his litany of praise for Hannah Malloy's dad, Andy, noting his commitment to the craft in setting up his tripod six full minutes before the show began and then leaving the lens cap on the camera through the entire opening number, challenging the viewer to rely on senses other than mere sight'and their faith in the performers'in order to enmesh themselves in the musical performance. 'During 'Luck Be A Lady Tonight,' Malloy managed to zoom in and out on nearly every person onstage before panning around the entire auditorium to capture the audience's response, a technique never before attempted in my professional experience. He depended on no cuts, quick or otherwise, employed no trickery, and never once fell back on the crutch of editing. At one point, Mr. Malloy can even be heard asking his wife where the back-up battery is before handing the camera to her while he rifles through his bag'simply breathtaking verité. I also hope Mr. Malloy inspires more filmmakers to provide an intermission to give the viewer time to reflect on the experience and use the restroom if needed.' Critics added, at the risk of cursing Malloy with anticipation, that they 'cannot wait' to see his adaptation of the eighth-grade graduation ceremony this June.","theater, news, vol 55 issue 19, entertainment"

Stine disclosed during an interview Monday that all of his writing is dictated to him directly by God. 'One morning, I was walking in the woods behind my house when lo! I suddenly heard the voice of the Lord ring out, commanding me to transcribe His message. I fell to my knees and received His divine command to publish His truths, verbatim, in a series of 120-page horror fiction books for kids to purchase at Scholastic book fairs across the country,' said Stine, insisting he could never take full credit for classics such as Say Cheese And Die or Phantom Of The Auditorium, as he had merely served as a conduit for the teachings of the divine Creator. 'It could have been anyone on Earth, but He chose me to act as a herald of His voice and a vessel for His words, and I feel truly humbled. There were times when I cursed the tremendous burden of channeling The Supreme Being, and I often asked myself, 'Why me? Why must I be the one to write Under The Magician's Spell?' But I knew there was a higher purpose for me, much like that revealed in the divine text of Stay Out Of The Basement.'

They really go out of their way to talk up Valyrian steel over and over again,' said local Game Of Thrones fan Emily Lopez, explaining that her exasperation with the overtly corporate-minded HBO producers had reached a boiling point following a recent scene that seemed to exist for no other reason than for one character to 'ooh and ahh' over a Valyrian steel sword given to him as a gift. 'I mean, I get it, they have to pay the bills somehow, but it's getting ridiculous. Valyrian steel basically has the whole show in their pockets, and now it's like every episode is just a commercial for high-end swords and spears. It's so distracting.' Lopez also expressed her growing frustration with the show's increasingly frequent mentions of brand-name Dragonglass.","television, game of thrones, vol 55 issue 18, entertainment"

'Originally, I intended for Chewbacca to be a loquacious, somewhat uptight academic who would converse at length about a number of convictions, tenets, and principles, but Peter, off the top of his head, brilliantly portrayed the giant, hairy creature as a formidable growling colossus,' said Lucas in a statement memorializing the actor, recalling how Mayhew had effortlessly transformed the rigid, erudite Wookiee into a massive, grunting beast. 'Peter had this amazing vision and played the character as an incredibly strong and intimidating behemoth with a bad temper. Sometimes, you really need to let actors improvise and live within a character, and amazing things will happen. While I still stand by my original concept of Chewbacca as a high-strung neat freak who constantly cleans up after others, Peter really made the Wookiee his own.' At press time, Lucas released rare photos of Mayhew modeling the original cardigan, ascot, and pipe that comprised early versions of Chewbacca's costume.

'Nothing will compare to the thrill of hearing Mr. Sullivan introduce us as a 'few fine young men from South Korea' way back when, but it's still great to reconnect with fans in the States after nearly six decades,' said band vocalist Jimin, who called the show's host 'a true class act' for putting them on the bill of the November 3, 1963 episode headlined by Sid Caesar and ventriloquist Rickie Layne. 'Obviously, you could barely hear us playing 'We On' over all the teenagers screaming, but even at the time, I knew this was going to change our lives forever.'

'Sure, Beyoncé doesn't own the copyright on pregnancy, but to the millions who watched last night as Taylor delivered a baby boy and girl onstage at the MGM Grand, it sure felt like plagiarism,' wrote entertainment blogger Emily Brooks, who cited Swift's 'total lack of creativity' in imitating Beyoncé so closely, from the birthing of fraternal twins right down to the ultimate decision to undergo an emergency C-section at her doctor's discretion. 'I understand that great minds often think alike, but this was way over the line. Even the sound Taylor made during labor before being rushed into the NICU was basically a carbon copy. You can't just go around stealing other people's ideas'especially when you're stealing from the queen.'

259,Experts Praise Upcoming 'Sonic' Movie For Accurate Depiction Of Hedgehogs,"CHAMPAIGN, IL'Animal experts praised the upcoming animated film Sonic: The Hedgehog Tuesday for its accurate depiction of hedgehogs, noting that most media representations leave out the creature's tendency to roll up into a fast-moving blue ball to attack enemy combatants. 'Most of the hedgehogs we see in film and TV are portrayed as timid, antisocial creatures, which completely glosses over both the frequent smoke trails they leave in their lightning-fast wake and their daily ritual of battling their natural enemy, the nefarious mad scientist,' said University of Illinois zoologist Dr. Krista Keller, adding that the 6-inch woodland dweller Americans typically see only exists on the silver screen, while the common hedgehog is approximately 3 feet tall, stands on two sneaker-clad feet, and zooms through city streets to save our planet from sure destruction. 'The creators of Sonic really did their homework by exploring the life of our glowing, neon-blue little friends that arrived from Mobius with such precision and care. This is exciting, too, because the quiet, plodding hedgehog you're familiar with pales in comparison to the real ones I work with as a veterinary professor. I'm much more accustomed to observing hedgehogs that crackle with electricity and run up the side of skyscrapers and jump off buildings to escape the dreaded Dr. Robotnik, all the while tossing out clever quips in plain English.' Dr. Keller added that the film, unfortunately, appears to present yet another unrealistic depiction of James Marsden.","movies, news, vol 55 issue 18, entertainment"

Champ Says Key To Success Is Threatening Other Contestants With Nail-Studded Baseball Bat During Commercials,"CULVER CITY, CA'Revealing the secret behind his lucrative run on the TV game show, unbeatable Jeopardy! champion James Holzhauer told reporters Tuesday that the key to his success was threatening other contestants with a nail-studded baseball bat during commercial breaks. 'My approach is pretty simple: I wait until a few seconds before a new round starts, get the other players' attention, and tell them I'll bash in their goddamn skulls if I don't win,' said Holzhauer, 34, who explained that he had managed to win over $1 million in only 15 games by gripping the bat tightly, taking a few swings near the heads of the other contestants, and stowing the bat behind his podium before taping restarted to emphasize that a potential beating was only moments away. 'It's really all about timing. You have to menace them with the nail-studded baseball bat before each and every round so they're absolutely terrified to buzz in before you do. You also have to remember that the clock's ticking and you only have a couple minutes of ads to warn the other players that you'll cave their fucking faces in and splatter their brains all over the set if they cross you. It's really less about knowing a lot of trivia, although that's definitely important, than it is to be able to really hone in on how you'll bludgeon them to a bloody pulp before attacking any of their loved ones in the studio audience if you lose.' Holzhauer added that he believed his strategy to be more effective than that of fellow Jeopardy! legend Ken Jennings, who has said the key to his success was holding a gun to his head before the Final Jeopardy! round and threatening to blow his brains out if he didn't win.","jeopardy!, tv, news, vol 55 issue 18, entertainment"

'Right away, when I finished the script, I felt this sense of immense loss at throwing away the prime of my life performing in a make-believe world of CGI dragons and giants,' said series regular Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who described feeling stunned when discovering that he had squandered day after day of his precious existence freezing his ass off in Belfast-based shoots just to play a mediocre role in an emotionally incoherent series that had stretched on for years too long. 'I'll never forget when [showrunner] David Benioff sat me down and told me the fate of the Night King and I thought: Who gives a flying fuck? What am I still doing on this show?

'As far as we know, this movie doesn't really have much of a cult following, so it's kind of weird that it was showing on enough screens to take in $400 million domestically during a span of three days,' said box office forecaster Errol Kaucher, who reached out to several of the 5,000 theaters screening the film in an effort to determine how they all independently decided to run the nearly two-decade-old buddy comedy, reportedly without even consulting each other. 'To be clear, this isn't a remake. It's the original movie. Everyone's money was on Avengers: Endgame taking it all last weekend, but somehow Saving Silverman came along and blew it out of the water. [Director] Dennis Dugan has had box office success before with Grown Ups, but we really didn't think he was capable of anything like this. We did have an early indication something was up after hearing about sold-out theaters in the select cities that got a sneak-peak of Saving Silverman on Thursday. Still, this pretty much came out of nowhere.' At press time, analysts confirmed they were again confounded after learning Saving Silverman had resonated deeply with Chinese audiences and grossed an additional $1 billion overseas.

'I've put hundreds of hours of my life into this series, and now it seems it's all been a waste,' said self-described Song Of Ice And Fire 'superfan' Aaron Tremaine, 31, recounting how his initial excitement at the beginning of each new season shifted to sadness after being repeatedly deprived of steamy dragon-on-dragon sex. 'Of course, I didn't expect it to happen in the very first scene of the pilot, but I figured it had to happen eventually. They spent so many episodes building up the whole 'will-they-won't-they' tension with Drogon and Rhaegal, and now it seems like it's never going to pay off.

'As punishment for the dishonesty, flippancy, and disregard for the law Ms. Loughlin has displayed, I've sentenced her to perform in a minimum of 12 different community theatre productions around the greater Los Angeles area,' said Judge Kim, who expressed his intention of sending a message to all those who believe themselves to be above the law through the actress's mandatory court-ordered participation in small-scale productions of The Pajama Game, Oklahoma, Little Shop of Horrors, and an upcoming modern retelling of The Crucible. 'Loughlin will be required to run lines with a designated sponsor to ensure she's completely off-book for each production, and learn all necessary choreography and blocking. She will even be required to work as a grip when needed. Everyone should know what it's like to work for weeks on a play that goes up for an audience of nine people'if Ms. Loughlin had known what was at stake, perhaps she would have thought twice about her crimes.'

272,Christian Bale Loses 40 Years For Upcoming Movie Role,"LOS ANGELES'Committing to a strict age-reduction diet and infantilizing exercise regimen in preparation for the role, infamously dedicated method actor Christian Bale revealed Friday that he lost 40 years in order to portray 5-year-old composer prodigy Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in the prestige historical drama Wunderkind. 'I knew it would be physically taxing, and possibly even dangerous, to do something like this, but my age-regression trainers are the absolute best and saw to it that I never shed more than 10 years in a given week,' said the Oscar-winning actor and functional kindergartener who worked with speech pathologists and physical therapists to degrade his verbal and motor skills, respectively. 'When I signed up to play a young Mozart, I knew I'd have to immerse myself in the role. I was able to drop the first few decades pretty quickly, actually, but I plateaued hard around 15, and those last 10 years were a bit of a slog. We're still in production right now, but my next role sees me playing the wizard Merlin, so I'll have to pack on another 180 years soon. Going through puberty again will be an ordeal, I'm sure, but with any luck, I'll be legal drinking age in time for the Wunderkind wrap party.' Sources involved with production on Wunderkind said the project is dangerously over budget and will likely shut down over a lack of funding.","christian bale, celebrities, movies, news, vol 55 issue 15, entertainment"

279,Disney Estate Uncovers Cache Of Anti-American Cartoons Intended For Release If Axis Won WWII,"SAN FRANCISCO'In a shocking discovery certain to complicate the legacy of a national icon, the estate of Walt Disney announced Friday it had discovered a cache of anti-American cartoons the pioneering animator intended to release if the Axis Powers had triumphed in World War II. The newfound materials reveal that in 1942, as Hitler's war machine was nearing the height of its European occupation, Disney ordered his studio to produce animated propaganda praising a global empire ruled by Germany, Italy, and Japan. Hidden away in a vault for nearly 75 years'and starring classic characters such as Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck'the never-before-seen shorts and feature-length works depict Americans as lazy, corrupt, and inferior to the morally upstanding German patriots who will soon conquer them. 'There are hours of cartoons in which Mickey and the gang teach American children that U.S. soldiers were cowardly murderers and a worldwide Jewish conspiracy was responsible for the war,' said Walt Disney Family Museum curator Eileen Bryant as she described Wehrmacht Duck, which features Nazi paratrooper Donald shouting 'Blood and soil!' as he lands in an American town, distributes copies of Mein Kampf to teachers, and lectures Nordic-looking children on racial hygiene. 'Walt wanted to cover all his bases in the event of an Allied surrender. If the D-Day invasion had failed, he would have sent his first short, U-Boat Willie, directly to Joseph Goebbels.' 'He just wanted to make sure his production company had distribution and a market, whether he was living under a sovereign American government or Hitler's thousand-year Reich,' she added. The Disney estate confirmed one of the features found in the vault is a remake of Fantasia in which Jewish composer Paul Dukas' 'Sorcerer's Apprentice' is replaced with an all-Wagner score. The revised story reportedly centers around a young Mickey Mouse who, upon discovering his true Aryan heritage in a dream, reawakens as an bermaus and begins goose-stepping in time to the increasingly feverish music. Documents indicate that following an Axis victory, Disney would have had the movie screened in every theater across North America, along with a re-cut version of Bambi that depicts the title character's mother and all the forest animals as genetically defective creatures who are rightfully slaughtered by the film's heroic hunters. According to studio memos, all screenings would begin with a featurette in which FDR'portrayed by Goofy as an effeminate weakling whose pants fall down to the sound of a slide whistle every time he attempts to rise from his wheelchair'is sent to a camp for liquidation. 'A lot of these cartoons were aimed at convincing Americans of German heritage they were victims of a Jewish-led assault on their culture, especially the shorts starring Heinrich, Diedrick, and Ludwig,' said Bryant, referencing the duckling brothers better known as Huey, Dewey, and Louie. 'In 1943's The Third Reich Is All-Reich With Me, the brothers are rewarded for alerting their Waffen-SS uncle Donald to the secret hiding place of Pluto the Plutocrat, a dog with a Star of David pendant hanging from his collar. As a show of gratitude, the Gestapo decides to make them honorary secret police-ducks.' Estate officials confirmed the collection also contains propaganda intended to prepare Americans for a Nazi occupation, including a public service announcement in which Minnie Mouse, an emblem of Aryan motherhood who has renounced her U.S. citizenship, is seen embroidering the words 'Long live our glorious Führer' on a shawl. She tells viewers how proud she is to be raising children for the Fatherland and encourages American-born members of the master race to begin assembling baptismal records so their new masters can verify the purity of their blood. 'All these works, along with Walt's early concept art of a swastika-festooned Epcot Center, were locked away after V-E Day,' Bryant said. 'By today's standards, they of course seem bigoted, even hateful, but it's important to view them within the historical context in which they were made.'

287,USC Insists Lori Loughlin's Daughter Was Admitted Solely Based On Socioeconomic Background,"LOS ANGELES'Following revelations about the actress's alleged involvement in a college bribery scandal, University of Southern California officials told reporters Tuesday that Lori Loughlin's daughter was admitted solely based on her socioeconomic background. 'We certainly condemn bribery, but we would also like to acknowledge that USC student Olivia Jade earned her way here just like every other freshman: By having lucked into growing up in the right zip code,' said spokesperson Sara McLaren, explaining that the 19-year-old Bel Air native demonstrated that she was Trojan material by listing an elite all-girls private school with a nearly $40,000-per-year tuition on her Common Application. 'Since our founding in 1880, applicants have been assessed purely on strength of social class, and Olivia's name jumped right off the page. From extracurriculars that are exclusive to the top 1 percent, to college prep classes exclusive to the top 1 percent, to recommendation letters from other members of the top 1 percent, Olivia gained entrance to USC on her economic merit and her economic merit alone.' McLaren added that the YouTube personality also appealed to admissions officers by offering a diversity in perspective to her freshman class with her experiences of growing up a celebrity.","college, crime, news, vol 55 issue 11, entertainment"

290,CBS Sitcoms Under Fire For Using Prison Laughter,"BURBANK, CA'Criticizing the network for the cruel and unusual treatment, inmate rights groups blasted CBS programming executives Friday after evidence revealing the use of prison laughter on their sitcoms became public. 'Evidently, incarcerated men and women are forced to sit and watch hour after hour of live taping. Witnesses say that if guards aren't pleased with the volume and frequency of laughs produced'demand can sometimes be as high as 15 laughs a minute'inmates can be thrown in solitary confinement. This is just wrong,' said Samantha Aguerra, a spokesperson for the prisoners' rights group Jailhouse Lawyers Speak, who added that many prisoners agree to the grueling, thankless 'sweetening' task and are not informed that studies show working in a CBS studio audience increases violent tendencies as well as the risk of recidivism. 'It's inhumane for a person to spend long, uncomfortable hours in a regimented environment where human functions, such as outbursts of laughter and bathroom breaks, are strictly scheduled. People don't want to think about where the laughter and applause on their favorite shows come from, but it's on all of them'Everybody Loves Raymond, Young Sheldon, 2 Broke Girls. I don't know what the studio audiences of these shows did to get sent to prison, but no one deserves to watch this and be expected to laugh. It's disgusting that the same questionable practices that gave us Sanford and Son are still in use today.' Aguerra added that, upon their release, many inmates find they are unable to get jobs working at CBS due to the network's distrust of former audience members.","tv, prison, news, vol 55 issue 11, entertainment"

'Mr. Underwood convinced these women they were going to be wealthy and famous if they came to live with him in this house and showered him with attention,' an official investigating the case said on condition of anonymity, detailing how the 27-year-old former NFL practice squad player manipulated women at the mansion, where he promptly seized control of all aspects of their lives, including what they wore, what they ate, and when they could speak to him. 'There's a real power dynamic here. He gives them the sense they're special by taking them on hot tub dates and beach trips. He engages in fear tactics with 'rose ceremonies' in which he threatens to exile those he deems insufficiently devoted. He'll even corner them alone on one-on-ones. And meanwhile, this pervert is filming the whole thing.' At press time, authorities were reportedly panicking after realizing Underwood had fled the country with a handful of the women in a jet bound for the tropics.","tv, news, vol 55 issue 10, entertainment"

'With Pete and Kate on our team, we can show New Yorkers that no matter who's winning, there's still no better place to publicly make out with your date than right here by the ice in Madison Square Garden.'

295,Michael Jackson Estate Questions Why Accusers Only Coming Forward Steadily Since Early 1990s,"SANTA BARBARA, CA'Noting that the timing of the allegations appeared to be 'a little too perfect,' a lawyer representing Michael Jackson's estate questioned Wednesday why those accusing the late pop icon of child sexual abuse had only come forward steadily since the early 1990s. 'It seems awfully convenient that all these people suddenly decided to come out of the woodwork on a regular basis over the course of a quarter century,' said Jonathan Steinsapir, explaining that he also found it quite suspicious that some had chosen to make their accusations as grown men instead of doing so back in the '90s like so many other children did. 'This all seems like quite the coincidence to me. Are we to believe that one man with access to a private Peter Pan'themed ranch, a multimillion-dollar legal team, and a rabid fanbase willing to ignore his considerable eccentricities could just molest a bunch of kids without us finding out about more than a handful of them per year since 1992? That's a bit far-fetched.' Steinsapir added that suspecting a grown man of sexual misconduct simply because he made a habit of inviting underage fans to sleepovers in which they shared his bed was unfair and 'frankly just cynical.'","michael jackson, sexual abuse, sexual assault, news, vol 55 issue 10, entertainment"

'We were living in a wonderful era of insipid franchise-driven blockbusters when, suddenly, Netflix comes along and screws everything up by giving a platform to underrepresented directors and helping connect audiences across the globe to risk-taking, idiosyncratic films that would never be made by a major studio,' said the director of Ready Player One and Jurassic Park, blasting the streaming service for sabotaging the halcyon days of lowest-common-denominator cinema that gave viewers absolutely no credit and merely indulged their basest instincts. 'They should be ashamed. They've single-handedly put an end to dull, inoffensive films that privilege melodrama and spectacle over substance, not to mention the fact that they've eroded the influence of executives who only care about producing movies that make as much money as possible. There were so many great artists, myself included, who sold out decades ago and, as a result, no longer have the ability to make a movie as resonant as, say, Roma. What will happen to us?' At press time, Steven Spielberg quickly retracted all of his comments and began praising Netflix after the company offered him a multimillion-dollar, two-picture deal.","steven spielberg, netflix, movies, news, vol 55 issue 10, entertainment"

'Christ, okay, shit, maybe we can get some B-roll footage to establish a visual explanation for Peter's head being chopped off by that piece of lighting equipment that came loose and plummeted to the ground,' said executive producer David Benioff, scrambling to set up a shot with a character wielding a bloody axe to justify why Dinklage was headless on the floor. 'Come on, people, we don't have much time here. Let's get some makeup on Peter's face to fix that discolored skin. Clean up that blood, but save it, don't throw it out, that stuff looks pretty realistic on camera. Alright, tape Peter's head back on and let's nail this scene.'

'A lot of gossip has been floating around about the two of us, so let me assure you that not once have I ever felt that Bradley Cooper possessed any real skills or anything resembling artistic merit,' said the Oscar-winning songwriter, noting that if she conveyed any sign of respect toward the man who directed and appeared with her in the film A Star Is Born, she was simply doing her job as an actor. 'The only reason people think I have a high regard for his craft is because, as performers, that's what we want you to think. In reality, I don't feel that way about him at all, and I hope this puts an end to any theories out there that I have ever considered Bradley to be anything more than a complete and utter hack.' When reached for comment, Bradley Cooper told reporters that he is a huge fan of Lady Gaga, has been a huge fan of Lady Gaga since the first time he ever saw her, and would leave his partner and child to commit himself completely to Lady Gaga and her career if she would only say the word.","lady gaga, bradley cooper, music, movies, relationships, news, vol 55 issue 09, entertainment"
301,Michael Jackson Estate Releases New Documentary Alleging King Of Pop Gets Lifetime Pass For 'Thriller',"LOS ANGELES'In response to a film featuring two men who say that the singer sexually abused them as children, the estate of Michael Jackson released a new documentary Friday alleging that the King of Pop gets a lifetime pass for Thriller. 'The claim we lay out in our documentary is that whatever bad things that pop icon Michael Jackson has done, they should be swept under the rug for writing 'Billie Jean' and 'Beat It,'' read a statement by the estate accompanying the debut of the Sony-produced documentary, Don't Be Startin' Somethin' adding that they hoped the film would expose the truth that the artistic achievements of the 33-time platinum album should 'more than cancel out' any indiscretions Jackson committed after its 1982 release. 'Whether he drugged and molested children simply doesn't matter when you consider how Jackson changed the game with those dance moves in the video for 'Billie Jean,' and these allegations simply ignore the complexity of the album's assertive, dynamic musical production coupled with its introspective lyrics. We hope that our documentary will finally give fans of Jackson's work the chance to reflect on how mind-blowingly innovative his music was and how whatever else he did just doesn't matter.' The Jackson estate refused to respond to criticisms that the documentary was trying to whitewash the singer's past by leaving out any mention of Thriller's first single, 'The Girl Is Mine.'","michael jackson, music, sexual abuse, news, vol 55 issue 09, entertainment"
302,A History Of Weezer,"Weezer will release its 13th studio album, the self-titled 'Black Album,' on March 1, continuing a 25-year career that has had its share of ups and downs. The Onion looks back at the history of Weezer. United States military occupies Japan, leading to a long-lasting cultural exchange. Rivers Cuomo was having a rough childhood, probably. In need of some background music for his eye-catching videos, director Spike Jonze creates the band Weezer. Weezer's video for 'Buddy Holly' receives the highly coveted and prestigious honor of being featured on the companion CD for the Windows 95 operating system. Record sales soar with rumors that drummer Patrick Wilson shot 2Pac. The band waits quietly in the studio waiting for Rivers Cuomo to finish Harvard. Weezer releases Maladroit, its fourth studio album, featuring more songs and choruses and riffs and stuff. The 'Red Album' features the band experimenting with more terrible material. The band scraps an entire album's worth of songs after they're unable to decide on a color. After many years of pulling on the single thread, the sweater from 'Undone (The Sweater Song)' is finally completely destroyed.","weezer, music, history, infographic, vol 55 issue 09, entertainment"

'Look, Cavalcade was a fine popcorn flick, but better than Capra's Lady For A Day? Really? I'm sorry, but I'll never forgive the Academy for that horseshit decision,' said New York resident Elliot Spencer, who echoed the near-unanimous sentiment of 323 million Americans in noting that not a day has gone by since the 1933 awards when he doesn't find himself shaking with rage at the insult of depriving director Frank Capra the industry's top honor and to instead reward such a paint-by-the-numbers, pandering piece of filmmaking. 'The other day, I had a screaming match with a friend who said Cavalcade wasn't really that bad. Seriously? I can't think of a single greater injustice than seeing that hack Frank Lloyd onstage stealing Best Picture from Capra. God, I'm getting so fucking angry right now just remembering it.' At press time, the entire nation was stressing that they did think Green Book probably deserved to win this year.","oscars, movies, news, vol 55 issue 09, entertainment"

311,Most Memorable Oscars Speeches Of All Time,"Acceptance speeches are a cornerstone of the Academy Awards ceremony and have provided their share of tears, laughter, and controversy over the years. The Onion looks back at the most memorable Oscars acceptance speeches of all time. Landed in hot water while thanking his high school drama teacher during his acceptance speech for Philadelphia when he inadvertently outed the film's main character as gay. Accepting the award for Titanic, an emotional Cameron stated, 'I figured the rubes would turn out to watch this fucker, but I never expected this.' Really took their sweet time. Was booed offstage after accidentally thanking the Hollywood Foreign Press instead of the Academy. Didn't give a speech for some reason. The 73-year-old veteran actor memorably conveyed his exuberance by dragging a locomotive onto the stage with his testicles. Kissing Halle Berry during his acceptance speech is renowned as one of the most memorable sexual assaults of an awards presenter in Oscars history. The Italian actor-director famously climbed over the seats to accept his award, and then awkwardly climbed back over them after receiving it. Many people famously misremember a quote in her speech as 'You like me, you really like me,' when in reality she said 'Socialism is the future, to fight it is folly.' Oscars attendees booed Native American activist Sacheen Littlefeather, who declined the award in Brando's place, for drawing attention to the fact that they are assholes.","vol 55 issue 08, oscars, oscars 2019, entertainment"

314,Biggest Snubs In Oscars History,"The Academy Awards inspire debate every year about whether certain films, directors, and actors were recognized over more deserving ones, and over time, some of those overlooked movies and performances have come to seem particularly egregious. The Onion looks back at the biggest Oscars snubs in history. While Orson Welles' magnum opus is considered a masterpiece today, audiences in 1942 just weren't as into being bored out of their fucking minds. The Academy made up for snubbing this Martin Scorsese movie by also snubbing Goodfellas 10 years later. His failure to win a Best Actor award despite a long and illustrious film career has been attributed to the Academy's notorious pro-Xenu bias. Was considered a shoo-in for Best Shark. Left out of the Best Actress category for The Wizard Of Oz in which the 16-year-old acts, sings, and dances in a starring role, Garland was instead awarded an adorable miniature Oscar statuette called the Juvenile Award, which totally wasn't patronizing at all. If we'd just given James Cameron the stupid award back in 2009 maybe we wouldn't have to go through four more installments of this garbage. He's been in like 30 movies and still not a single Oscar. Many felt this gripping modern-day Western was far more deserving than La La Land to be mistakenly announced as the winner before losing to Moonlight. Never won Best Director despite his work pioneering the film style in which a bunch of fake-looking animals attack humans for no reason. All three lost Best Picture to an equally deserving Rocky in 1976, when the film industry learned they're better off releasing a maximum of one good movie per year.","oscars, movies, infographic, vol 55 issue 08, oscars 2019, entertainment"

'They left plenty of Easter eggs hinting at it in the first three Avengers movies, so it's pretty obvious'the way to counter Thanos' power now that he has all the infinity stones must be to simply realize he's CGI and that it's just a movie,' Avengers fan Raoul Bengston wrote in an online forum, detailing the potential implications of the villain being completely imaginary, including the possibility that the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe could itself be a wholly fabricated world devised decades ago by comic book writers. 'Imagine what it would mean if, instead of T'Challa and Peter Parker disintegrating at the end of Infinity War, they turned out to be fictional characters portrayed by professional actors Chadwick Boseman and Tom Holland, who ultimately survive because the infinity stones aren't real? Could be quite a game-changer.' At press time, the majority of fans on the forum had begun to tear into the new theory, deeming it 'far-fetched' and 'unrealistic.'

324,New Evidence In Murder Case Leads Authorities To Narrow Down List Of Possible Actors Who Could Play Killer,"DOYLESTOWN, PA'Saying they have begun to make significant headway in the case, law enforcement officials told reporters Monday that new evidence in an ongoing murder investigation has allowed them to narrow down the list of actors who could portray the killer in a Hollywood movie. Until this week, police confirmed, their inquiry into the Jan. 3 homicide of local woman Debra Hambleton, 39, has provided them with few clues as to who might star as her murderer in a dark retelling of the story on screen. But now, a forensic analysis of the derelict cabin in which the victim's body was found suggests a prolonged, violent struggle, an indication the killer would likely be played by a physically imposing Tom Hardy type, or perhaps someone like Nicolas Cage, whom detectives said they could see 'just totally losing it' for the murder scene. 'At the present time, we are looking into eight actors who we believe may have the potential to pull off something like this,' said Sgt. Hank Bouchard of the Doylestown Police Department, who has previously stated that if the killer turns out to be the victim's boyfriend, he should be played by someone with the simmering tension of Sean Penn, only younger. 'From the descriptions given by witnesses, we should be looking for a white male in his late 30s or 40s, which at first made us think Joaquin Phoenix, though something about him just didn't seem to fit.' 'There was no sign of a break-in,' Bouchard continued, 'so it was either someone the deceased trusted or someone who looked trustworthy enough to let inside her home'handsome, with both a kind face, like Matt Damon or Bradley Cooper, but also a tinge of menace in his eyes.' Additionally, Bouchard noted that composite sketches suggest the murderer is of medium build with prominent cheekbones and a sharp jawline, causing investigators to reassess their initial inclination toward an actor along the lines of Russell Crowe, unless the performer agreed to lose weight for the role. In an effort to take advantage of the new developments in the case, authorities said they have assembled a special unit that will spend the next few weeks scouring through hours of film footage and talent agency databases in order to find the person who could portray such a heinous crime while also having enough star power to carry a big-budget film adaptation. On Monday, the team reportedly sat in an office surrounded by headshots of Hollywood A-listers and discussed the possibility of a more offbeat casting choice, pinning up photos of Sam Rockwell and Ed Norton on a bulletin board next to an autopsy report and images of Hambleton's body. 'There is a strong likelihood it will turn out to be an actor who has done this kind of thing before, but we're not totally discounting the possibility of an up-and-comer,' said Bouchard, explaining that producers wouldn't have to settle on someone obvious like Christian Bale, who played a serial killer in American Psycho. 'This could be a role for a new face, a talent able to evince a deeply unsettling mien who could go on to become his generation's Willem Dafoe or Christopher Walken.' 'At this point, one thing's for sure: We're going to get the sonuvabitch with the range to do this,' he added. Though Bouchard and his detectives expressed confidence they were on the right track, others have put forward their own theories as to who could be Hambleton's murderer on screen someday. 'I don't think he'd be acting alone'the evidence just doesn't add up,' said Bucks County assistant district attorney Sam Avery, telling reporters he has been putting in 80-hours weeks on the case and believes there were three individuals present at the crime scene, the victim and two perpetrators. 'Maybe instead of spending all this time trying to find our man, we should be looking for a pair of co-stars with undeniable chemistry, like Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill.' The one thing all law enforcement officials seem to agree on is that Hambleton, who was chased through the woods and stabbed 42 times in the chest, bears a strong resemblance to Toni Collette, and if her murderer manages to evade justice for decades, he could perhaps be portrayed in his older years by a Bruce Dern type. At press time, Bouchard held a press conference to announce that because of new information provided by an anonymous tipster, police have turned their attention to television and made phone calls to see if Jason Sudeikis is available.","crime, tv, movies, news, vol 55 issue 05, entertainment"

Pig, and others'as they navigate the depraved sexual fantasies of their professor at a school based on Acme Looniversity. 'Believe it or not, the dashing Professor Dodd character from my book first took form as a taller, more humanoid, and sexually insatiable version of Gogo Dodo, who in the cartoon always struck me as this very carnal being.

LOUIS'Noting that recording artists, musical groups, and associated acts now outnumber the global population roughly 50 to one, a study conducted by the University of Washington's Institute for Learning and Brain Sciences found Thursday that no two people have listened to the same band since the autumn of 2003. 'After 15 years of extensive research during which we surveyed more than 10 million American consumers, we've determined that explosive growth in the number of bands has left the U.S. populace with literally zero shared musical reference points,' said lead researcher Dr. Thomas Alvine, explaining that the increased accessibility of recorded music due to streaming sites, in conjunction with the growing simplicity of making music in a digital age, has led to such a proliferation of groups that no single artist, album, or even song has been heard by more than one individual in over a decade. 'In the '60s and '70s, of course, there was a shared musical culture. An entire generation could enjoy the stylings of, say, your Rolling Stones your James Taylors. But not since the late '90s has the sheer number of available recordings been limited enough for any decently sized group of friends to have even one song in common. You and only you have actually heard your favorite rapper, rock group, jam band, DJ, singer'songwriter, electro-pop duo, or Kanye West. As far as we are able to determine, the last song heard by more than one person was Outkast's 'Hey Ya,' which, in fact, had several hundred fans.' Alvine added that, by 2023, no two people will likely even be referring to the same tonal and rhythmic patterns as 'music.'","music, news, vol 55 issue 04, entertainment"

332,Fans Shocked After Marie Kondo Reveals She Has Been Dating Untidy Cupboard For Past 6 Months,"BROOKLYN, NY'Shocked, disillusioned, and even somewhat betrayed by the unlikely pairing, fans of best-selling author and decluttering guru Marie Kondo were reacting with general disapproval Friday at the news that the organizing consultant has been dating an untidy kitchen cupboard since July of last year. 'I can't believe she has the gall to enter people's homes, rummage through all their personal belongings, and tell them to throw out their things while she's out there sharing a perfectly made bed with a messy old cupboard,' said Tidying Up With Marie Kondo enthusiast Catherine Walstrom, 31, who claimed she lost all faith in Kondo's signature KonMari method after seeing photos of Kondo attending a formal dinner with the unkempt storage unit as it overflowed with unused tea kettles, old recipe books, and promotional coffee mugs. 'I've spent hours learning to fold my shirts perfectly, so it seems hypocritical for her to go around with a beat-up cabinet that smells of expired coupons. I guess I just imagined her with a clear plastic bin'one featuring handles in which everything is visible, the contents arranged to stand vertically'but seeing her with that loose-hinged disaster just makes me feel like the magic of tidying up is nothing but a big lie.' More forgiving fans theorized that perhaps the cabinet did indeed at one point spark joy within Kondo, and that she simply may not yet be ready to thank the dilapidated cabinet for its service and toss it aside.","marie kondo, dating, tv, books, news, vol 55 issue 03, entertainment"

'Well, I finished all of the words I planned to sing and we still have 30 seconds on the track, so...I might as well just some make deep, emotive noises for a while,' said Robinson, adding that she would probably start by wailing in her regular voice before throwing in a few falsetto notes for good measure. 'There are three of us up here, so I assume that they'll probably be moaning, too. Maybe we'll do a little harmony or a round or something. The backup singers seem to be doing your traditional 'mmmmuuhhhhhh,' so I'll definitely moan some 'yeeeeeeeuuuuuuhhhhssss' for some variety. Actually'shit, the song's still going. I guess maybe I'll do a couple dozen variations on the world 'baby' for a while.' At press time, sources reported that even after the background music had ended, Robinson still continued moaning for an additional 17 minutes.","music, news, vol 55 issue 03, entertainment"

345,Radio Station Playing Controversial 'Little Drummer Boy' On Repeat In Defiance Of Those Who Claim It Contains Sexually Predatory Themes,"LEXINGTON, KY'Pushing back against what they view as political correctness run amok, DJs at local radio station 104.5 'The Cat' were defiantly playing 'The Little Drummer Boy' on repeat Tuesday despite claims that the Christmas standard contains sexually predatory themes. 'This is a classic song, and the manufactured outrage surrounding it won't frighten us into taking it off the air,' said Director of Programming Darren Boccia, telling reporters that he rejected the modern interpretation of a hidden, coercive meaning behind lyrics like 'Come they told me' and 'Pa rum pum pum pum.' 'I grew up singing this song, my kids grew up singing it, and we're not going to stop playing it because a few people with dirty minds have constructed some perverse narrative about the ox and ram keeping time that no one was thinking about when the song was written in the 1940s. We'll be playing 'The Little Drummer Boy' 24/7 until Christmas, and if people don't like it, they can switch to a different station.' Boccia added that the station would continue its years-long practice of refusing to play 'Silver Bells' due to the song being an obvious affront to Christ.","music, holidays, news, vol 54 issue 51, entertainment"

'While we appreciate The Cure's musical contributions, the band will not be taking part in our annual ceremony.

Because I know that one day, you're all going to wake up and realize that you're sick of this Marvel shit, and you'll dump our sorry asses and never come back,' said Iger, adding that between the movies, theme park expansions, and television shows, Disney would go bankrupt almost instantaneously if consumer tastes changed even slightly. 'Every day, my heart stops when I see the box office numbers. How many more of these goddamn Avengers films can we make before the well runs dry? Thirty? Fifty? The bottom line is that the number isn't infinite, and frankly, that's terrifying. No matter how many run-of-the-mill animated features we shit out after that, it would never cover the losses.'

'I'm a little anxious that this sixth movie is just going to a big, loud, moronic waste of time,' said Davis, who shared his opinion that the trailer for the new movie made it seem like a dumbed-down version of the previous five installments. 'Of course I was excited when it was first announced, but the more that comes out about it, the more it seems like unnecessary retreading of old themes and familiar characters. I'm trying to keep my hopes up, but I can't help but think they'll go for cheap thrills and flashy action sequences instead of really approaching these mechanized humanoid aliens with anything approaching nuance.'

'You can read it over if you'd like, but it's all just boring fine-print stuff that lets me do whatever I want to you, sexually or otherwise, without ever facing any real consequences,' said Chapman, who advised 27-year-old Lindsey Bridges to skip past the clauses that allow him to verbally abuse her throughout the film's production, describing them as normal for a studio feature in which the female lead will be subjected to the terrifying outbursts of a powerful egomaniac. 'It's nothing to sweat over. Any lawyer will tell you it's merely the regular boilerplate language that leaves you with no legal recourse against unwelcome advances, violent threats, gaslighting, or any other kind of bullying you could possibly imagine. Like I said, it's all pretty customary.'

'It was a nice touch of whimsy when the Globetrotter's bus broke down near the containment wall, but honestly, it also kind of seems like they're running out of ideas,' said longtime viewer Albert Garcia, who said he enjoyed the scene in which Rick Grimes and Curly Neal foraged for supplies in the ruins of an abandoned basketball arena, but also felt the storyline lacked the emotional gravitas that has come to define the show through its first nine seasons. 'I'm not really sure how I felt about the part where the Dizzy took off a zombie's head and spun it on his finger. That said, I did chuckle when Big Easy doused Negan with a bucket of confetti. Overall, though, it seemed a little desperate. And, naturally, it was kind of a bummer when that one racist character came back to kill them all at the end.' Fan reaction to the episode seemed almost unanimous, however, in that the Globetrotters' appearance on The Walking Dead made far more sense than than the exhibition basketball team's central, pivotal role in the 2009 series finale of Battlestar Galactica.","tv, news, vol 54 issue 48, entertainment"

'Now, some might argue that after being caught once in a cascading slurry of brownish-yellow fecal matter, these specific people would have been wiser to avoid Chicago architecture cruises entirely. But obviously, the blame falls squarely on us. We thought we learned a lot from this unfortunate accident, but clearly we didn't learn enough.'

But critics failed to realize that those albums were just vain attempts to compete with the gorgeously understated melodies and feather-light falsetto that made A Rush Of Blood To The Head so hauntingly beautiful. After that album came out, Jonny, our guitarist, called me in a panic and said we needed to get back in the studio immediately. Coldplay may not have put anything out recently, but I know that they're just waiting, conserving their strength, preparing to release an incredible concept album and forever unseat us as the second coming of Pink Floyd. It might be enough if, just once, [undisputed genius singer-songwriter and spiritual heir to the musical and thematic legacies of Depeche Mode and Talking Heads] Chris [Martin] would say 'good job, mate' after I put out an album, but until then, I'll try and take motivation from living in his incredibly long shadow.' Yorke added that, had it not been for Coldplay's epic, genre-defining Super Bowl halftime show, he may never have considered bringing Radiohead's music to large stadiums.","thom yorke, coldplay, music, celebrities, news, vol 54 issue 42, entertainment"
378,Roseanne' Spinoff Showrunner Hopes Big Puddle Of Blood In Kitchen Enough To Explain Main Character's Disappearance,"LOS ANGELES'Discussing how narrative cohesion would be maintained in the new sitcom, the showrunner of the upcoming Roseanne spinoff told reporters Tuesday that he hoped the giant puddle of blood in the set's kitchen would adequately explain the former main character's absence. 'Sure, we could have had one of the many remaining characters just come out and explain what happened to Roseanne, but we have too much respect for our audience to spoon-feed them the storyline that way,' said Conners executive producer Bruce Helford of the bright red puddle of prop blood that is shown spreading across the titular family's linoleum kitchen floor in the first episode of the new series. 'As it happens, if you listen closely, you should be able to tell exactly what we're going for with the blood. At one point in the script, D.J. says, 'It's a shame what happened to Mom,' while pointing at the puddle. We also have Jackie referring to the puddle as 'Roseanne' in a couple scenes. Hopefully that will do the trick.' Sources confirmed that before the show taped, Helford ordered a set dresser to drop a few tufts of brown hair to the puddle for added realism.","tv, news, vol 54 issue 42, entertainment"

'We're at this point in history where humans can't relax'they're on edge, they're high-strung, and we aren't experiencing true leisure because free time is a myth,' said the Grammy Award'winning artist, who had entered the massage parlor and immediately leaped onto the nearest empty table, speaking uninterrupted for 15 minutes in a monologue that touched on ending aging, loosening up muscle groups, the hero's journey, freeing spiritual energy, and 'empowering the whole globe to chill' to the largely silent clientele. 'I don't care if it's reiki. I don't care if it's shiatsu. We've got to detoxify the human experience. And that starts here. Right here. Maybe you weren't expecting to hear from a motherfucker like me, but you best believe it's time to focus on rest and recovery.' At press time, West had been spotted standing atop the counter at a nearby Panera Bread delivering a soliloquy about the way a steaming bowl of soup on a cold day could make every person in the world 'feel like a superhero.'","kanye west, news, vol 54 issue 41, entertainment"

'Oh God, oh God, oh God'no!' the man said in an apparent attempt to warn Jackson Maine, the successful but self-destructive rockstar portrayed by Cooper in his directorial debut, of some sort of threat presumably posed by the unknown but incandescently talented singer'songwriter Ally (Lady Gaga), seemingly completely unaware he was disturbing and distracting his fellow filmgoers. 'No! Don't pick up the guitar! You idiot, that's exactly what she wants you to do! Just run away! Run!'

'This award is'in the limited frame of reference that is my own life'a pretty big deal, so I just can't help but be curious if it's crossed anyone's mind. If not, that's fine, mind you, seeing as there are so many more important stories in the news these days,' said the celebrated actor, emphasizing that although the recognition is certainly nowhere near as significant as Brett Kavanaugh's controversial Supreme Court nomination, the Me Too and Black Lives Matter movements, widespread, growing economic inequality and disparity, the tumultuous Trump presidency, and continued accelerating environmental decay, he still believes a show-business career that has resulted in six Golden Globes, six Emmy Awards, three Tony nominations, and an Oscar nomination to be worth at least a little attention. 'I mean, sure, it's not a Nobel Prize, but in its own way, it's still pretty impressive. Dr. Hawkeye Pierce may not have cured cancer or anything, but my performance on M*A*S*H brought joy to millions of people for over a decade, and I like to think that's got to count for something. I know, I know, it's just an award, but they don't hand it out to just anyone, and I think it's, you know, just nice to get a little recognition, even for something as trivial as a decades-long entertainment career.' Alda went on to apologize for the role his involvement with M*A*S*H may have contributed to the glorification of the U.S. military-industrial complex.","alan alda, celebrities, news, vol 54 issue 40, entertainment"

'I could say I'm a Democrat or a Republican'it wouldn't matter. I wouldn't even have to have a platform and a ton of people would still vote for me, no questions asked.

389,David Lynch Finally Releases Colorized Edition Of 'Eraserhead',"LOS ANGELES'Emphasizing that the bright hues and striking tones would finally bring his vision to life, filmmaker David Lynch announced Wednesday that he had released a colorized edition of his seminal work, Eraserhead. 'Sadly, when we shot Eraserhead, we did not have the technology to make this film the sensory overload of technicolor that it was always meant to be,' said Lynch, who lamented that his original storyboards for the film, which featured characters bathed in bright pinks and blinding yellows, had to be scrapped in favor of a grayscale color scheme 'mired with dark shadows and grainy, distracting dark splotches.' 'Would I have preferred to shoot the bleeding rotisserie chicken in a striking blood-red, like it was written? Or the sperm-shaped alien fetus in it's glowing, rosey tones? Of course. Which is why today, Eraserhead, and my 1980 film The Elephant Man, will be filled in with over 4,000 shades of beautiful color.' Lynch also added that the new release would be re-cut to include a pivotal scene in which a doctor operates on Henry's baby early on, allowing it to lead a normal life.","movies, news, vol 54 issue 39, entertainment"

The Onion looks back at some memorable milestones from the show's seven-season run. Just an unbelievable amount of shit piled on poor Shawn while the rest of the characters deal with their little rich people problems. In one of the series's strongest episodes, Cory leaves his comfort zone to pursue something he wants only to find it's not exactly what he expected, and he learns a valuable lesson about life. Eric suffers a traumatic head injury, leading to three laugh-out-loud seasons. Mr. Feeny suffers a heart attack after Cory and Shawn prank him by hiding his heart medicine. Topanga throws her fucking life away by deciding not to go to Yale and marrying Cory instead. When Shawn's dad passes away, Mr. Matthews offers to let Shawn sleep in his car for one night. Cory and Shawn have a brief falling out after arguing about the impeachment of Bill Clinton. The final episode closes with Mr. Feeny saying 'Class dismissed' to an empty room, confirming earlier hints in the series of his descent into dementia.","tv, history, infographic, vol 54 issue 39, entertainment"

'It feels like just yesterday when I trotted out there for the first time, rubbed my temples with my fingers, and caused golf-ball-sized hail to pelt Boston. These days, it gets kind of exhausting to adjust the position of the sun in the sky or summon a hurricane with intense concentration. I've been incredibly fortunate to generate the temperature and precipitation activity for so long, but sometimes, it's just time to pass the job on to the next generation.'

'These 16 discs offer dedicated fans a chance to finally experience Help's 'Glove In Glove,' Abbey Road's 'My Baby's Knuckles,' A Hard Day's Night's 'Clasp It Tight (My Hand),' and so many of John, Paul, Ringo, and George's other odes to hand-holding that were previously lost to time,' said spokesperson Peter Totten of the package, which includes bonus features such as the band's fraught in-studio arguments about John Lennon's experimental soundscape 'Revolution 10,' archival footage of the 90-piece orchestra performing the swelling anthem 'The Grasp,' and photos of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's hand-holding meditation that inspired Paul McCartney's 'Mother Nature's Grip.' 'From the German tunes written during their 1964 Hamburg residency like 'Ich Liebe Deine Fingers' to later gems like Let It Be's 'Entwined With My Honey Pie,' these recordings make up a massive trove of music about the band's affinity for clutching your partner's hand that, until now, have been left on the cutting room floor.'

Here are The Onion's predictions for this year's winners. This stunning new dark comedy from HBO stars Bill Hader as an new aspiring actor struggling to conceal his past identity as President Barack Obama. Emmy voters have stated they'd like to stop giving it awards but it feels like they're too far into it at this point and they might as well just keep awarding it all the way to the end. Starring in the second season of The Handmaid's Tale, Moss impressed audiences and critics alike with her ability to memorize all those lines. The biting late-night show will hopefully beat the one where the celebrities sing songs and the one where celebrities lip-sync songs. Wait, you mean that wasn't her on The Queen? Oh, man, you had us fooled! At just seven episodes, Godless takes the prize for not being an absolute slog to binge-watch. SNL producer Lorne Michaels' decision to take a flier on the little-known but hardworking Baldwin has paid dividends by showcasing an actor who adds something new and interesting to his Donald Trump impression each and every time he appears.

This movie about a singer-songwriter who gets her big break will have to overcome Hollywood's famous distaste for movies about the entertainment industry if it stands a chance of winning any awards. As you can probably guess from the title, and lead Paul Giamatti, it's that kind of film. The movie about the first moon landing is drawing controversy over its decision to whitewash Neil Armstrong's ardent anarcho-syndicalist beliefs. Curious audiences across the country will finally find out whether director Michael Moore thinks the Trump administration is good or bad. In this star-studded blockbuster, the interstellar hunter returns to Earth in search of fresh profits. Critics have already named this lighthearted comedy one of the top 10 Kevin Hart films of 2018. Yup, Hollywood somehow still isn't done cranking out Harry Potter shit yet. Fans of rich period dramas with lush British landscapes, heavily accented dialogue, and beautifully intricate gowns are going to cream their fucking seats.","movies, infographic, vol 54 issue 37, entertainment"

'We want to provide Les with a certain amount of freedom so he can just harass on his own schedule,' said CBS board member Charles K.

'Les has so much institutional knowledge about creating a hostile work environment, but we imagine he'll be doing most of his bullying and coercion over the phone. However, if he's more comfortable doing it in person, we can just send a few female employees over to his home office. He'll technically be a freelance predator, so we'll be paying him on a case-by-case basis. Though I think Les would agree that this isn't about the money'he truly loves doing this stuff.'

403,"Rock The Caliphate' Charity Concert Features U2, Ed Sheeran, Dua Lipa Coming Together To Raise Money For Struggling Islamic State","LOS ANGELES'In an effort to provide much-needed assistance to the beleaguered terrorist organization, a charity concert known as Rock The Caliphate'featuring U2, Ed Sheeran, Dua Lipa, and other top musical acts'was held last night to raise money for the struggling Islamic State. According to event organizers, the star-studded benefit, held before a crowd of nearly 100,000 at the Los Angeles Coliseum and live-streamed over the internet to millions more, aimed to bring together the biggest names in pop music and fund relief efforts that will aid ISIS militants in their attempt to reestablish a caliphate and return to the territories they once called home. 'We can no longer turn a blind eye toward the devastation faced by this group of radical Islamists,' said Bono, U2 frontman and one of the concert's organizers, who appeared on stage in his trademark wraparound shades and with an ISIS flag draped over his shoulders. 'In the past few years, nearly all the land of their great country has been stripped away from them, and they have seen tens of thousands of their brethren killed by bombs. They have been left with almost nothing. Tonight, we come together to say, 'No more!' Tonight, we come to offer help.' 'All proceeds from this performance will go directly to underprivileged jihadis,' Bono continued, 'because no child soldier deserves to go off and fight for a cause without food in his stomach and a Kalashnikov in his hands.' After his high-energy set opening the four-hour concert, performer Bruno Mars lent his star power to the Islamic State by working the phone banks, where he reportedly solicited donations from TV viewers alongside celebrities such as Jimmy Fallon, Jennifer Lawrence, self-proclaimed caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and Chris Pratt. The pop sensation told callers their contributions would help ensure ISIS recruits receive the training they need to conduct public floggings, burn people alive, stone infidels to death, and throw adulterers off the roofs of tall buildings. 'For these terrorists, the dream of a global caliphate completely cleansed of Christians, Jews, Yazidis, and Shia Muslims is dying,' said singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran, who told reporters he was persuaded to participate in the benefit show after learning many in the Islamic State don't even have human shields to protect themselves with. 'They have so much potential'they could be out there retaking Raqqa and Mosul'but they've been left destitute by airstrikes and Kurdish freedom fighters. We have to get out there and do something to empower these people, like giving them the tools they need to build explosive devices and carry out violent beheadings.' 'If even one person hears me singing and the power of music moves them to reach into their hearts and pockets and give so that a young ISIS teen can strap on his first suicide vest, then I've done my part as an artist,' Sheeran added. For the show's final encore, Dua Lipa, Lady Gaga, Adam Levine of Maroon 5, and Cardi B joined U2 for a performance of 'I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For' that was accompanied by a video montage showing the ravaged remains of the caliphate as it shrinks from an area the size of Britain to a few tiny Syrian outposts. A new recording of the song has been made available in the iTunes store, with revenues reportedly going toward the purchase of computers that will allow budding ISIS cyber-warriors to fulfill their dreams of hacking into the servers of Western governments and, in time, destroying all of Christendom. As of press time, the track had already been downloaded more than 17 million times. Sources reported that al-Baghdadi was pleased with the sold-out benefit concert and deemed the event an overwhelming success after a series of charges placed throughout the stadium were simultaneously detonated, killing everyone in attendance.","music, news, vol 54 issue 36, entertainment"

'I've always loved how real and honest Louis C.K.'s material was, but this new set completely left out all the fucked-up sexual manipulation stuff that's been his trademark for so long,' said Draeving, who recounted his initial excitement at the comedian's return following his 2017 sexual misconduct allegations and explained that his enthusiasm quickly soured as it became clear C.K.'s usual warts-and-all style of comedy would skip right over his predilection for cornering female comedians and forcing them to watch him masturbate. 'I just thought his set would focus more on exploiting vulnerable women in his field for his own gratification. I mean, what makes Louis C.K. special is that he has so many layers, like how his actions were not only sexually inappropriate, but also a deliberate abuse of power against those with less influence in the industry'women whose careers and personal lives would be irreparably damaged as a result. I guess he sort of mentioned jacking off a little, but it seemed pretty disconnected from the stuff about his management threatening to derail these women's careers if they told anyone about it, or about how traumatic and shameful the experience must've been for them in the moment. Man, he's really not the same now.'

Martin will, in fact, finish his long-awaited sixth novel in the A Song Of Ice And Fire series, only to rip it apart and feed it into a blazing fire, page by page,' said fan Bennett Mills, recounting the incredible attention to detail evident in the brief, barely legible glimpses of dialogue between Arya and Sansa Stark right before the pages were engulfed by flames. 'This completely changes my expectations. I'm such a huge fan that I'm pretty much game for whatever they have in store'and, honestly, the trailer is packed full of hints about the crazed tyrannical author bringing about swift and crushing destruction this season. It was a pretty blink-or-you'll-miss-it moment, so you might have to watch it a couple times to catch the part where he feeds the final 400 pages into an industrial paper shredder. It happens fast, but it's instantly recognizable to any true fan of the show.' At press time, Game Of Thrones fans were attempting to decode the meaning of the opening shot of the trailer, which showed Martin stuffing the first three pages of the manuscript in his mouth before urinating on the rest.","game of thrones, george r.r. martin, tv, news, vol 54 issue 35, entertainment"
410,Report: John Lennon Probably Would Have Eventually Died Anyway,"NEW YORK'Considering the likelihood of a myriad of theoretical outcomes if the singer had survived his 1980 shooting death, experts reported Monday that John Lennon probably would have eventually died anyway. 'If he had enough time and the shooting hadn't happened, we assume he would have passed away of natural causes or a common disease at some point,' said music historian and Beatles biographer Sophie Bates, explaining that they arrived at this conclusion partially based on the eventual, seemingly inevitable fate of fellow Beatle George Harrison, who died of cancer in 2001. 'Even if Lennon was able to avoid contracting any sort of fatal illness, he still could have been killed prematurely, whether in a car accident or simply by being murdered at a different point down the line'maybe by being poisoned or stabbed, or even shot by someone else. Maybe one of the Beatles might have strangled Lennon after an argument about lyrics. What we know for sure is that if he wasn't shot, he would have certainly died some other way, likely within the following 50 years.' Bates went on to explain that, based on her research, it was unlikely Ringo Starr would ever die.","john lennon, history, news, vol 54 issue 35, entertainment"

Netflix confirmed two dozen women were flown in from all over the United States to a replica White House mansion in the scenic island getaway of Aruba, where, over the course of eight episodes, they competed in daily presidential challenges such as attending state visits with foreign dignitaries, selecting judicial nominees, planning a romantic date night in a mock-up of Obama's Hyde Park neighborhood, and developing a coherent Syria policy. 'Viewers will be thrilled to watch Mr. Obama as he navigates a sea of love to find the one special woman he wants to share his post-presidency with,' said Netflix executive Cindy Holland, noting that the series would premiere with the tagline 'Love has no term limit.' 'There will be tears and heartbreak, but when this wild ride is over, one of these lucky 'first ladies' will land the president she's always dreamed of.' 'At the end of the day, finding that special someone is a challenge for everyone, even the former leader of the free world,' Holland added. Filming is said to have begun in February, with Obama greeting his prospective love interests as they exited a Hummer limousine onto the North Lawn of the recreated White House. One by one, the contestants'including former Miss Teen USA Danika Owens, 22; office temp Ambre Newlon, 21; and Tucson-based cocktail waitress Kassidy Vance, 25'reportedly hugged the president and gave a short introduction, some choosing to recite a favorite passage from The Audacity Of Hope and all hoping to become one of the final eight contestants selected to join Obama's Cabinet. Publicity clips revealed that after the young women settled into their luxurious new digs, they spent a day preparing to serve as Obama's press secretary, with each getting a chance to conduct a daily briefing for reporters and the winner receiving a bouquet of flowers picked from the Rose Garden by the onetime commander in chief. In a promotional screener for the first episode, drama struck right away, with several of the women complaining they weren't able to spend quality time with Obama because 23-year-old event planner Mindy Bell has hogged him all night by making out with him in the Oval Office jacuzzi. However, by the end of the series premiere, Bell was forced to leave the White House after failing to receive an American flag lapel pin symbolizing Obama's love. 'Barack and I just, like, have so much in common between our love of basketball and helping people,' yoga instructor Kayleigh Sutherland, 21, said in one of the clips after winning a challenge in which each woman has to serve as a senior adviser to the former president, briefing him on the best strategy for winning her heart. 'Some of the other girls have criticized me, saying I didn't even vote for him. But what they don't realize is that I'm very politics minded [sic] and would have voted for him in a heartbeat if I had turned 18 in time.' 'I still can't believe he has daughters my age,' Sutherland added. Producers stated that as the show progresses, several frontrunners begin to emerge, with Obama taking a liking to Alexis Nash, 23, after they bond during a group date to promote job-training initiatives for low-income Chicago youths. According to sources, conservative Trump supporter Tami Lynn Gibbs, 21, also becomes a favorite following a one-on-one date during which she and the president visit his hometown of Honolulu and fly Predator drones together on the beach during sunset. Netflix executives said the series builds to a climax as the contestants become increasingly competitive about who gets to join Obama in the Lincoln Bedroom once he has dismissed the Secret Service for the night. They described how the president's resolve was put to the test when he must hold diplomatic talks in the Situation Room after several of the contestants insulted 24-year-old acupuncturist Ree Ree Clark, calling her a 'skank' and a 'gold-digging hoe in chief.' Following lengthy negotiations, Obama reportedly managed to secure a resolution in which all parties agreed the use of such epithets was not conducive to long-term mutual prosperity. 'These are some really wonderful women, and if I could choose all of them, I would,' the 44th president said in one scene as he stares pensively out over the Truman Balcony in a tan tuxedo, awaiting the ceremony in which he will finally reveal the name of the woman he wants to be with. 'Unfortunately, I can't, so I'll just have to follow my heart. In the end, it's the heart that matters. This may be the most difficult situation I've ever faced.' 'After all, this is love we're talking about,' the Nobel Peace Prize laureate adds. At press time, sources confirmed Obama had nearly proposed to Barack Of Love champion Alexis Nash, but after a last-minute change of heart, he instead chose to elope with the show's runner-up, Ann Coulter.","barack obama, netflix, tv, news, vol 54 issue 34, entertainment"

'There are so many easy changes you can make in your day-to-day routine that make an instant difference in your complexion'and for me, that's always meant setting aside four or five minutes every morning to wolf down a couple big rings of smoked Polish pork sausage,' the actress-turned-wellness-guru wrote in an editorial featured on her lifestyle website Goop, enhancing the article with a step-by-step skincare guide beginning with frying the sausages in lard alongside bacon and onions, accompanying the treatment with an entire loaf of caraway rye slathered in butter, and concluding with a pore-refining post-sausage cigarette and frosted mug of dark beer. 'There are always lot of questions when setting off on a new skincare journey, but it's important you feel free to make adjustments based on whatever's right for your skin'explore the different nurturing effects of boiled or baked kielbasa, serving with pore-shrinking sauerkraut, cleansing mustard, or even a pound or two of invigorating egg noodles in a sour cream and chitterling sauce. Just listen to your body.' Paltrow concluded her post with a recommendation that users purchase one of her $80 artisanal pork fat candles, which she claims are specifically molded and dipped for purposes of postprandial meditation.","celebrities, diet, food, news, vol 54 issue 34, entertainment"

'It just seems like I've sort of been in a rough spot here for the past two or three decades,' said Burton, 59, admitting that he really thought he had turned a corner with Big Fish, only to take eight steps backward with Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, Corpse Bride, Sweeney Todd, Alice In Wonderland, Dark Shadows, Frankenweenie, Big Eyes, and Miss Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children. 'I recognize, of course, that it's all part of the process. Sometimes, you just need to make 14 bad movies to make a good one.

'What we tried to do in 'Paw-lice Bru-tail-ity' was use Chase's gunning down of a weaponless Zuma to start a dialogue,' staffer Louise Moon said of the storyline in which a bigoted Cap'n Turbot reports a 'thuggish black dog' for loitering in his gated community moments before Chase arrives, mistakes Zuma's bone for a gun, and shoots indiscriminately at the fleeing canine while shouting his signature catchphrase, 'These paws uphold the laws!' 'The fact is that whether they're 2- or 11-years-old, our viewers are smart enough to decide for themselves whether Chase's family and career should be ripped apart just because of a split-second decision. Our job is just to represent the political moment'from the violent Antifa protests to Chase's PTSD-fraught leave of absence'using the only medium we have, and I believe we did that.' At press time, the PAW Patrol writers remained silent about the episode involving the deportation of thousands of Chihuahuas accused of stealing jobs and crippling Adventure Bay's economy.","tv, race, news, vol 54 issue 33, entertainment"

'While this decision is sure to be unpopular with users, our internal projections show that not sending them $500 every 30 days will result in annual savings of almost $6,000 per subscriber,' said Lowe, noting that MoviePass' financial situation was such that sending users as little as $300 per month may not be a sustainable business practice. 'It's tough because this was a cornerstone of our business model and also because people really loved those free checks. But we just can't seem to turn a profit when the subscription fee we charge is only 99 cents. We thought maybe if we cut out the movie-viewing part entirely and made it a money mailing service it might work, but that didn't really improve our operating costs.' Lowe assured wary investors that MoviePass would continue to offer 72 months of free service for new subscribers.","business, movies, news, vol 54 issue 33, entertainment"

'It was, surprisingly, a lot of hard work being such an ineffective dipshit 24/7,' said Momoa, 39, adding that he often felt exhausted after long days spent paddling aimlessly around aquatic film sets while staring off into the sky. 'I'd have to say that the most difficult part of playing Aquaman was mastering his method of showing up places where things needed to be done, but then doing nothing despite how much I felt like doing something. If my wife was doing dishes and asked me for a towel, I couldn't even say no, because even that response would be too helpful. Believe me, it takes a lot of willpower to simply exist as a completely ineffectual dope.' Momoa claimed he passed the time on set by alternating between trying to imagine how being able to ask fish for help would be at all useful and hitting his head against a wall to stay unfocused.","celebrities, movies, news, vol 54 issue 33, entertainment"
420,Fantasy Novel Not Holding Back On Criticisms Of Dwarvish Culture,"FORSYTH, IL'Characterizing the reclusive subterranean race of diminutive miners right off the bat as 'possessed of a fiery demeanor most unpleasant' from its opening pages, fantasy novel The Mage's Shadow was not holding back on its criticisms of dwarvish culture in the least, readers confirmed Thursday. 'For a whole damn page, this book is just railing against dwarves, portraying them as greedy and violent by nature and out-and-out stating they're 'curmudgeons, the lot of them, stubborn as the Zorthesian day is long,'' said fantasy aficionado James Tillman, explaining he had initially assumed the book was about to moderate its editorial voice when it got to a dialogue-heavy passage, only to find two sorcerers 'just start ragging the poor guys out of nowhere' about how the dwarvenkind 'are born with tempers as short as their stature,' 'squander their sunless, joyless days on excesses of ale and impenetrable games of chance,' and 'are cursed with scowling visages most heinously ill-formed, and aside from perhaps those of the ork-kin, the most repulsive in all of Aldoria.' 'There is a brief passage, several chapters in, about dwarf families being 'fiercely loyal to their own,' but then the authorial gloves are off again in a pointed discussion of their 'bizarre silver-based society,' speculation on how their underground lifestyle is a manifestation of their inherent cowardice, and how their beards 'resemble nothing so much as the curséd Dùthronian Forest's fetid thatch.' I tell you, the dwarves can't catch a break.' Tillman further noted that every time The Mage's Shadow gave dwarves their due by noting their undeniable prowess at smithing and bladecraft, there was an accompanying passage noting that they habitually swindled patrons by adding base lead to their mystical sky-steel, not even batting their hooded, shifty eyes in the process.","books, news, vol 54 issue 33, entertainment"

'We thought it would be a fun little 30-second cameo from a popular New York figure, but we got barely any usable footage because Trump kept yelling [the N-word] at everyone in the lobby of the Plaza,' said the director, who divulged that several takes had to cut early as Trump unleashed a 15-20-minute torrent of various racial slurs, once even wrestling the Talkboy voice-changing tape recorder from Macaulay Culkin's hands and filling its 30-minute cassette with disparaging slurs for Mexicans. 'We had to spend two days shooting that scene. We'd feed him his line, but every time he'd say something like, 'The lobby's over there by those [N-words],' and we'd have to cut yet again. His cameo was meant to be much longer, but we edited it down to the few seconds where he wasn't bellowing anything horribly offensive.' Columbus went on to describe the full-page ad Trump took out in the New York Post demanding the Pigeon Lady's arrest and execution for her suspicious activities in Central Park.","donald trump, movies, news, vol 54 issue 33, entertainment"

The Onion takes a look at the most compelling and defining opening credits sequences of all time. All In The Family: U.S. audiences had never before seen a TV show opening that so brazenly suggested that women can play the piano. That '70s Show: The sequence of cast members in a car as seen from the dashboard is a subtle nod to the unique Wisconsin tradition of sitting in cars. The Dick Van Dyke Show: Not only was this sitcom's intro iconic, it helped raise awareness about the frequency of ottoman-related injuries, which the CDC estimated declined by nearly 45 percent over the run of the series. The Wire: We actually think this one is too long. Freaks And Geeks: Set to Joan Jett's 'Bad Reputation,' the time-lapse opening sequence of the cult show featured its cast rapidly going through puberty in two seconds while screaming in pain. Full House: Rewrote all the rules about what objects a character could catch and hold during an opening credits sequence. Jeopardy: Usually cut for time after the first season, the opening depicts Alex Trebek working his way up through the brutal trivia underworld. Diff'rent Strokes: Widely credited with teaching Americans that the world does not move to the beat of just one drum. Mad Men: The lyrical fall from grace of a silhouetted ad genius was punctuated by the sickening splat he made upon colliding with the Madison Avenue sidewalk.","tv, infographic, vol 54 issue 32, entertainment"

434,CBS Reveals 'Big Bang Theory' Season 12 Will Explore Why Sheldon Keeps Job After Sexually Harassing 6 Research Assistants,"NEW YORK'As part of a preview of the network's fall slate of shows, CBS revealed Monday that season 12 of the long-running sitcom The Big Bang Theory will explore why Sheldon Cooper keeps his job after sexually harassing six research assistants. 'The story arc, which spans the entire season, shows that while there might be some credibility to the accusations, he's far too important for the university to fire him now,' said Thom Sherman, the network's senior executive vice president of programming, explaining that the September 24 season premiere, 'The Accusation Attenuation,' featured six graduate students and several corroborating witnesses reporting Cooper for sexual harassment during his tenure as a theoretical physicist, the university's investigation into the matter, and its ultimate dismissal of the charges. 'As the season progresses, the incredibly thoughtful and cautious deans take the allegations extremely seriously before concluding, in the end, that all the women were likely lying. Not only are many of the accusations several years old, which obviously calls into question their timing, but also several of them are from opportunistic researchers who are plainly after Sheldon's job. Viewers will surely enjoy a poignant yet hilarious scene in episode six, 'The Uncertainty Principle,' where Sheldon has trouble communicating the right threats to a physicist candidate whose career he's planning to ruin. And the rest of the cast gets involved, of course, with Amy standing by her husband and attempting to discredit the accusers, while Howard, Leonard, and Raj eventually join the effort and convince two of the research assistants to recant their reports after repeatedly posting their personal information online. In the end, there's just not enough evidence to take down someone as important in his field as Sheldon.' CBS also announced that the upcoming second season of The Big Bang Theory's spinoff show, Young Sheldon, would explore how Sheldon Cooper became frustrated with women early on as the girls who attend his high school repeatedly refuse to have sex with him.","tv, sexual harassment, news, vol 54 issue 31, entertainment"

450,Jurassic World 2' To Feature More Scientifically Accurate Jeff Goldblum,"LOS ANGELES'Touting the upcoming film as a significant visual leap forward from the previous ones in the series, producers of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom told reporters Wednesday that their production includes a more scientifically accurate Jeff Goldblum. 'Thanks to advances in cinematic technology and digital imaging, as well as real-life biological and morphological discoveries made during the years of studying Jeff Goldblum since his appearance in the original Jurassic Park films, the Jeff Goldblum in Fallen Kingdom will be the most authentic-looking representation of Jeff Goldblum to ever appear on a movie screen,' said executive producer Colin Trevorrow, explaining that the filmmakers invited UCLA blumologists to Industrial Light & Magic to ensure that Jeff Goldblum's features, musculature, coloration, and gait were all realistic down to the last detail. 'We've always prided ourselves on making movies that look and feel lifelike, and it's safe to say that Fallen Kingdom filmgoers will be wowed by how real Jeff Goldblum appears in this one. Visual effects have come so far from previous, less natural depictions of Jeff Goldblum, such as in the original Jurassic Park in which Steven Spielberg used two men in a Jeff Goldblum costume. At the same time, exciting finds by experts have enabled us to recreate Jeff Goldblum as he really lived'for example, until recently, we had no idea that he was covered in feathers.' Treverrow also hinted that producers were already planning a Jurassic World sequel featuring a realistic depiction of a genetically modified half-human, half-Jeff Goldblum hybrid.","movies, celebrities, news, vol 54 issue 24, entertainment"

'It's truly a shame that the public will not get to watch as Roseanne Conner finally connects the dots and realizes the murder of Seth Rich was in fact a politically motivated hit job masterminded by the Clintons,' said Helford, adding that he felt the two-part primetime special, in which guest stars Sean Hannity and Kim Dotcom help Roseanne prove that Rich's cruel fate was sealed by the liberal establishment the moment he downloaded those DNC emails, was poised to win an Emmy. 'The scene where Dan storms into Comet Ping Pong and catches John Podesta red-handed was such a nuanced, multidimensional interpretation of the issues that matter to middle America, and it saddens me that our audience won't get the opportunity to experience it. It's what the entire show had been building up to since the reboot's first episode.' Helford went on to state that while the next season would have gotten a lot of laughs from serious subjects, it also would have made people really think about the way President Obama and George Soros staged Sandy Hook to justify a large-scale government seizure of Americans' firearms.","tv, roseanne barr, news, vol 54 issue 22, entertainment"
455,,"PHILADELPHIA'In response to the abrupt cancellation of the hit series Roseanne the media watchdog group FactCheck.org blasted ABC Tuesday for its unrealistic portrayal of racists actually facing consequences for their actions. 'This just does not represent how things actually work in America,' said spokesperson Rachel Donnelly, adding that the network's decision to end production of a popular primetime comedy merely because the eponymous lead described a black, senior advisor to the former president as an 'ape' grossly mischaracterizes the reality that racists can get away with whatever they want unchecked. 'For years, ABC has presented us with an honest and true-to-life view of blatant racism, but today, by moving to punish Roseanne Barr for repugnant, prejudiced remarks, network executives have shown that they are completely out of touch with modern sensibilities.' At press time, Donnelly claimed that ABC's parent company, Disney, deserved special blame for exposing impressionable children to such a lurid portrayal of repercussions for racial bigotry.","tv, roseanne barr, race, news, vol 54 issue 22, entertainment"

'After years of workshopping and late nights in the studio, we are proud to announce the release of the new Platinum Edition Kid A with all-new remastered between-track sketches, restored to their original 7-to-19-minute run times,' said lead singer Thom Yorke at the reissue's launch party, noting that the new version of their seminal 2000 album includes fan-favorite bonus skits where the band does multiple voices while pretending to order far too much food at a drive-through window, all in lossless 7.1 digital surround sound. 'Between classics like 'Everything In Its Right Place' and 'Optimistic,' and helping enhance Kid A's famously jaunty tone, we've returned our trademark high-energy comedy performances to their rightful place. Now, before you settle in to 'How To Disappear Completely,' you'll laugh yourself silly to hear [guitarist] Jonny Greenwood playing a convict strapped to an electric chair, only to find out the prison didn't pay its electricity bill on time'just as we originally intended. We hope fans enjoy them as much as we do.'

'What Harvey did to all those women is totally fucked up and appalling, but just think of the gorgeous, star-studded cast'this story has all the ingredients for a massive summer blockbuster,' said Moss, who added he could think of roughly a dozen Hollywood leading men with the energy necessary to play the lead role. 'Right now, he's the ultimate villain you love to hate. He's just pure evil. Seems like no redemption is possible for what he did to those women'and just think of the stunning women!

'Despite our great appreciation for President Carter's entertaining, informative celebration of all things peanut, we have made the difficult decision not to renew the series for a 10th season,' said Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, praising the long-running agri-documentary series and its host, the homespun former commander in chief who opened each episode by telling viewers to 'forget everything you know about peanuts' before launching into his weekly 90-minute exploration of peanut cultivation. 'Jimmy taught audiences a whole new way of looking at peanuts, from their early use as livestock feed through their heyday as a staple of American sandwich culture, all while examining the life of peanut producers around the world through deeply human profiles and hard-hitting interviews. While we are sad that dwindling viewership means creating new episodes is no longer a viable endeavor, we thank him for his impressive work. The special episode where he visits the land where his family peanut farm once stood is a three-hour odyssey we won't soon forget.'

464,Report: John Grisham Slowly But Surely Climbing List Of Greatest Living American Authors,"OXFORD, MI'In the wake of the literary world's loss of iconic New Journalism writer Tom Wolfe, a report released Tuesday by the New York Review Of Books revealed that John Grisham'the novelist behind such works as The Last Juror, A Time To Kill, and Skipping Christmas'was slowly but steadily climbing the ranks of the greatest living American authors. 'With the recent death of Tom Wolfe, we can confirm that Mr. Grisham, the legal fiction writer behind both Theodore Boone: The Accused and Theodore Boone: Kid Lawyer, has continued his reliable ascent up the most notable living names in American letters,' the report read in part, adding that the recent passing of Ursula Le Guin, Denis Johnson, and Robert M. Pirsig had also contributed to the crime author rising several places to 3,071 on a running ranking of important U.S. litterateurs. 'His position in the list did drop several dozen spots when he released Sycamore Row back in 2017, but otherwise, his march toward becoming one of the nation's most significant literary minds appears to be continuing unimpeded.' The report concluded that despite his recent gains, Grisham would likely never come to surpass David Baldacci, the current greatest living American author.","books, news, vol 54 issue 20, entertainment"

'We found no evidence that human resources had received complaints concerning the rhinestone whips or doggy-style spreaders in the BDSM playroom NBC installed, as per the terms of his contract, behind Mr. Lauer's office in 2006,' said NBCUniversal counsel Kim Harris, adding that Today Show leadership were also never made aware of any workplace transgressions in the former news anchor's butterfly fuck swings, steel stripper cages, or 10-man gangbang ligature frames. 'We take these claims very seriously, but our findings indicate that neither the misuse of shackles nor the flaying of human flesh for Mr. Lauer's pleasure was ever reported to administrators. To their knowledge, no one who was locked in Mr. Lauer's dungeon and maintained consciousness was ever made to feel uncomfortable during the lashing, gagging, or whipping.' Harris added that, going forward, NBC plans to more closely monitor all its sex dungeons to ensure its on-air talent is fostering a healthy and safe workplace environment.","media, matt lauer, news, vol 54 issue 19, entertainment"

'Honestly, I don't see what they find so offensive about this scene,' said director Brad Bird, adding that the sequence in question, which depicts a ferocious baby Jack-Jack pulling out and consuming coil after coil of a still-living henchman's steaming intestines, was relatively tame compared to the version from the original script. 'It's tough because we spent months studying anthropophagy, anatomy, and human pain response during vivisection to make sure we really got this scene right. We even offered to compromise by cutting the scene down to 17 minutes, but in the end, we caved. Pixar really wants that PG rating.' In related news, Bird won his battle with film-board censors to keep another scene in which Violet calls her mom a cunt.","pixar, movies, news, vol 54 issue 19, entertainment"

'If that slave owner so much as fixed his lips to say something to me, I would've just hopped on my Harley and ridden to freedom'probably would've popped a wheelie through the cotton fields as I peeled off, too,' said the Grammy Award winner, adding that while he 'vibed with certain Negro spirituals,' there was simply no way he would subject himself to the hardships of slavery. 'There's nothing that could ever stop me from making music. Point-blank. I would've parked my chopper at the studio and recorded an album about my experiences in the fields, inspiring slaves throughout the land to free themselves from their mental prison.'

469,New Historical Drama Just 90 Minutes Of Woman Holding Up Petticoats While Running Through Open Field,"LONDON'An early review confirmed Wednesday that upcoming historical drama The Sisters Of Darington Manor was just 90 minutes of a woman holding up her petticoats while scampering through an open field. 'After the opening credits roll, it's really just an hour and a half of a woman in a silk gown grabbing the hems of her petticoat while she hurries along a windswept plain,' said The Independent reviewer Christina Gordon, confirming that the costume drama'which offers no discernible dialogue and could take place at any point in history between the Georgian and Victorian eras'features a striking string soundtrack that swells to accentuate the woman's progress across what appears to be either the English heath or possibly the Scottish moorland. 'About midway through the movie, there's this 45-minute unbroken shot of her rushing in front of a misty hillside. Then she mounts a horse at one point and rides it for a few minutes, which was nice. But then she just gets off, hitches up her petticoat, and starts hurrying across the plain again.' While criticizing the film's lackluster narrative, Gordon praised the 'breathtaking finale,' in which the woman completes her 90-minute journey by rushing directly into the embrace of a troubled-looking but handsome man in a brown frock coat and cravat.","entertainment, tv, news, vol 54 issue 18, entertainment"

'Christ, we've worked so hard to maintain this image of Kanye as an incredibly vain, impulsive madman, and now he's gone and ruined it all,' said stressed-out publicist Tracy Nguyen Romulus, explaining that she was in the middle of a massive damage control campaign to counter the effects that West's statements had on fans who had always seen the hip-hop star as paranoid, egotistical, and delusional. 'I'm concerned that when people think of Kanye now, they'll associate him with these tweets, and not as being a batshit narcissist who will say absolutely anything for attention. Not to mention Kanye went and linked himself to our deeply unpopular president, destroying the illusion that he's really just a deranged egomaniac absolutely obsessed with fame and power, and someone who already voiced support for Trump in the past. I don't know what we're going to do.' The publicist was also worried that a number of Kanye's tweets about thought police and his inability to be managed would confuse and even alienate a public who knew the rapper to be straightforward, clear, and modest.","kanye west, entertainment, celebrities, politics, news, vol 54 issue 17, entertainment"

'Fans of The Handmaid's Tale are going to be thrilled to be back in the totalitarian Republic of Gilead, this time examining how radical feminist ideals can cross a line and, frankly, ruin the lives of decent male subjugators,' said producer Sheila Hockin, revealing that the second season really represented a cautionary tale, depicting the way feminists like Offred can unfairly target and tarnish the reputation of their male overseers simply because they enslaved women and ritualistically raped them for breeding purposes. 'It's especially relevant in the #MeToo era to have sympathetic portraits of characters like Commander Fred Waterford'as we do in the season premiere'who is demonized by the Social Justice Warrior Handmaids simply because he locks women in his home as part of a repressive regime intent on brainwashing, abusing, and murdering them.

'In the past, they've teased at the way the new movie is going to completely blow, but the full-length trailer really shows so much more about how shitty and wooden Alden Ehrenreich will be as a young Han Solo working his way through a boilerplate origin story,' said fan Lynn Hayes, noting that while the producers have provided hints at the way Solo would be a giant crock of shit'such as substantial script rewrites and the original directors being fired mid-shoot'it was a 'real treat' to see the new trailer reveal so much about how the cast's total lack of chemistry and the cringe-inducing dialogue would make the film a complete train wreck. 'The teaser definitely stoked a lot of speculation about whether the movie would be mediocre because of generic characters like Therm Scissorpunch, Ron Howard's uneven direction, or meaningless fan service like showing Chewbacca hugging his wife. It's cool to know that it's all of those things, and a lot more, that are really going to make this movie fucking garbage.'

'This is an incredible find,' said researcher Keith Dunbar, telling reporters that the unreleased 435-page novel, titled Techno-Land, centers on an innovative theme park in the near future that holds its opening day without anything major going wrong. 'This novel can easily stand alongside anything else Crichton has produced. Whether it's the rides running smoothly, families remaining together throughout the duration of their stay, or the state-of-the-art security system functioning as intended, this book has it all. There's one nail-biting scene where dozens of people start swarming the churro stand, and the employees are worried that they're going to run out of churros, but then at the last second they find another canister of batter in the back. And I don't want to give too much away, but there's a subplot involving a rogue employee who considers sabotaging the park before ultimately turning his frustration into productive discussions with management that fans are going to flip for.' Dunbar added that despite it having been written more than 20 years ago, the novel was remarkably prescient in its depiction of a society that blindly placed its faith in science and reaped no consequences whatsoever.","vol 54 issue 14, entertainment, books, technology, entertainment"

'There's plenty of blame to go around, as many of the film's problems lie squarely at the feet of white people'Jennifer Lee delivered a tepid screenplay that was done no favors by Chris Pine's hardly there performance.'

'Oh God, he clearly put so much work into the pitch, but I don't know how to tell him that John Cleese and Connie Booth already did the exact same thing, like, 40 years ago,' said Sarandos, attempting to find a tactful way to inform the former chief executive that his idea for Chez Obama, which would star the 44th president as a temperamental hotel proprietor who gets into all manner of farcical situations as he tries to corral his eccentric guests and wacky employees, was basically identical to the beloved British sitcom. 'I'm just sitting there nodding along as he goes on and on about how there would be so many opportunities for physical comedy in an episode where a bellhop's pet rat escapes the same day as the health inspector arrives, and I freeze. What am I supposed to say? He's honestly never heard of this show before?

'On a night traditionally filled with glitz and glam, it was race and gender equality that finally had their moment in the Oscars spotlight,' wrote countless slathering dipshits, who, by publishing surface-level puff pieces claiming that 'new voices had triumphed on the biggest stage in Tinseltown,' upended the very foundation on which journalism was based. 'Inclusion stole the show last night in a dazzling spectacle that proves once and for all that outside voices are the real up-and-coming stars. In many ways, it wasn't A-list celebrities who deserved a standing ovation yesterday, but representation itself.' At press time, the bumbling oafs continued to degrade their profession by declaring that, in many ways, America was the true Oscar darling.","oscars, entertainment, media, news, vol 54 issue 10, entertainment"

'Oh god, my fucking head'I can't believe I agreed to make that intergalactic murder mystery I talked about with Sandra Bullock last night,' said the Academy Award-winning director of The Shape of Water, who rubbed his temples and muttered, 'What the hell did I do?' after receiving a message confirming a 10 a.m. coffee meeting with Ryan Seacrest. 'I was so hammered, but I can vaguely recall promising to create three different Robert Redford biopics. Jesus, the last thing I remember was doing a round of shots and then insisting on directing and writing a reboot of The Watchmen for that one really nice bathroom attendant.' At press time, Del Toro announced that he better start writing after vomiting for several minutes into a nearby wastebasket.","entertainment, movies, celebrities, news, vol 54 issue 10, entertainment"
489,Unclear If Shirtless Man In Black-And-White Film Once Considered Attractive,"NASHVILLE'Confused as to how they should react to his physical appearance, sources reported Monday that it was unclear if the actor Ramon Novarro, who appears shirtless multiple times in the 1931 drama Daybreak, was once considered attractive. 'I guess he's decently tall, and he's certainly not overweight, but a smoldering object of desire? That's a tough sell for someone who wears his pants up to his ribcage,' said Katie Lubeck, 26, noting that although the heroine didn't seem to mind, Novarro's wispy pencil moustache didn't exactly scream 'hunk.' 'I'm also not sure if I'm supposed to laugh at some of these scenes or if they're supposed to be heartening. And what's with Novarro's long pauses after every line? Is that supposed to make him intense? Is that how courtship actually worked back then?' Upon learning that Novarro was eventually murdered by a pair of teenaged brothers working as prostitutes, Lubeck admitted that was 'actually kind of hot.'","movies, entertainment, news, vol 54 issue 10, entertainment"

'I started working with Daniel about 25 years ago'man, that makes me feel old!' said director Martin Scorsese, causing partygoers'including Helena Bonham Carter, Paul Thomas Anderson, and a costume designer from 1996's The Crucible'to chuckle as they snacked on chips and salsa, a platter of veggies with ranch dip, and Domino's pizza provided by the Academy. 'Back in those early days, I don't think he had any idea what he was getting himself into. But my God, look at him now. How things have changed.

Here are The Onion's selections for this year's winners. Get Out (Best Original Screenplay): This socially conscious thriller has been widely praised for sparking a national discussion about hypnotism. Sally Hawkins (Best Actress): A lead female character who never says a word is sure to appeal to many older Oscar voters. Star Wars: The Last Jedi (Best Sound Mixing): Critics agree that beeping and swooshing noises have never sounded crisper. Call Me By Your Name (Best Adapted Screenplay): Of all the disgraceful bottom-feeders who took another's work and passed it off as their own, James Ivory did the least shameful job. Gary Oldman (Best Actor): Let's see if Gary can pull this one out of his hat before those abuse allegations catch up to him. Coco (Best Animated Feature): Easily crushing the competition, Coco benefits from a tremendous soundtrack, great performances, and Pixar's inability to lose in this category. Richard Jenkins (Best Supporting Actor): The character actor known for performances in movies like Burn After Reading and Cabin In The Woods showed off his dramatic range this year by playing a character who isn't brutally murdered. Kong: Skull Island (Visual Effects): The visual effects team worked tirelessly to make the landscapes and actors look tiny compared to the regular-sized gorilla playing Kong. I Love You, Daddy (Best Picture): With a record 15 nominations, including Best Director, this magnum opus is the film to beat this year.","oscars, infographic, movies, vol 54 issue 09, entertainment"

'Even beyond its taut pacing and gorgeous cinematography, the film offers a glimpse at an alternate reality in which women still exist, but engage in no meaningful exchanges whatsoever,' said New York Times film critic A.O. Scott, noting that when the women of this advanced society do speak to each other, their dialogue centers around one or more prominent male characters. 'In the lush world the filmmakers have created, one 500 years removed from our own, there seem to be be fewer women in generalEE Apart from the throngs of ever-present female sex robots, only a scant few appear, and none over the age of 40.'

'I knocked out a single a few weeks ago, I threw together a trailer video, but I still have 15 songs to write by morning,' said the 37-year-old former boy-band star and current one-man hit factory while frantically flipping through old notebooks for inspiration. 'Okay, I've been here before, I got thisEE Blue-eyed soul, maybe something that sounds country for the Wal-Mart crowdEE Does 'Man with a plan' rhyme with 'Livin' off the land?'

'I'm also hearing that just after they left, these two lovebirds jumped straight into the same ostrich-drawn carriage and headed off toward towards her SoHo hotel, leaving nothing but lotus flowers and whalesong in their wake. Gosh, they make such a cute couple.'

504,Werner Herzog: I Killed And Ate Timothy Treadwell In 2003,"LOS ANGELES'Shedding new light on the tragic ending to his critically acclaimed portrait of the animal activist, filmmaker Werner Herzog told reporters Wednesday that he killed and ate Timothy Treadwell in 2003. 'I should finally say that during the filming of my documentary Grizzly Man, I mauled Timothy Treadwell to death and then devoured his remains,' said Herzog, admitting after 15 years that it was in fact he and not the grizzly bears of Katmai National Park who sunk his teeth into Treadwell's neck, ripped out his jugular, and feasted on his organs. 'Timothy and his girlfriend Amie Huguenard were setting up camp by a salmon stream when I approached them, aggressively batted them around, and then tore them limb-from-limb while they screamed. His judgment was perhaps clouded by his optimistic view of nature, which, in the end, sadly led to me picking his bones clean.' Herzog went on to say that the most tragic part of the story was that, after years of integration, Treadwell felt he had finally gained his trust.","entertainment, movies, crime, death, news, vol 54 issue 04, entertainment"

'Ever since I started acting, my wish has always been to land a role in a film directed by Woody Allen and then some months later release a statement expressing my remorse for taking the job and offering an apology to any women I may have inadvertently hurt,' said Caballero, adding that she has always fantasized about promising to never work with him again and then donating the salary she earned from starring in one of his trademark romantic comedies to a nonprofit combating sexual abuse. 'From a professional standpoint, there's nothing I want more than to go on 60 Minutes or a late-night talk show and explain how I never would have worked with Allen if I had the information I have now. Recounting how I took the role when I was younger and not secure enough in my career to speak up would really put me in the rare company of some actors I admire tremendously.' Caballero went on to say, however, that she wasn't above deeply regretting appearing in a high-budget blockbuster directed by someone like Brett Ratner.","entertainment, news, vol 54 issue 03, entertainment"

'So far I see Sandra Bullock and the woman from Lord of the Rings, but who plays the main character?' said the visibly confused Waskin, adding that though the preview for the upcoming heist comedy had just 20 seconds remaining and had featured a series of supporting characters including one or more likely romantic interests, it somehow had yet to reveal who had the lead role. 'James Corden definitely has a role, but he has to be some sort of comic relief sidekick. Why are they keeping the main guy such a secret? How will I know if I even want to see this movie if I don't know who the star is?'

He even offered to cut the sale price in half for an entire week of companionship, but we are steadfast in protecting the exclusivity of Mickey's attention.'

'Christ, I came into Episode VIII thinking they'd at least delve deeper into his backstory as a Sullustan arms dealer, but mostly he's just a blurry extra standing in the background,' said local fan Benjamin Waller, adding that it was an insult to devoted Nien Nunb fans for the movie's creators to only include the alien pilot and Resistance member in a small fraction of the film's 150-minute runtime. 'When I first saw him onscreen, I thought, 'Great, now the rest of the movie will really explore Nien Nunb's motivations for convincing his race to join the Rebel Alliance.' But then it just went back to Luke and Kyle Ren or whatever their names are. It's like, who cares? Give us more Nien Nunb!'

'While it's not ultimately for us to make the decision for, say, 91-year-old Tony Bennett or 85-year-old Loretta Lynn, we do urge such elder talents to pass away sooner rather than later. The earlier you depart this world, the more time we have to arrange for a younger contemporary artist to perform a touching medley of your most famous songs.'

'Hollywood is proud of its history, but unfortunately, this statue no longer coincides with the principles that we as an industry would like to represent,' said Hollywood Chamber of Commerce chair Arnold Slavens, adding that the statue featuring the famed film producer and MGM studio executive lasciviously gesturing to the young, concerned-looking starlet to sit on his open knee would be taken down later this afternoon. 'Like the famous Hollywood sign or the stars on the Walk of Fame, this statue was a proud, popular symbol for the film industry. For a long time, when people thought of Hollywood, they immediately thought of a powerful male figure sexually preying on the vulnerable. We think times have changed.'

'We only mixed it up physically once or twice, but having to deal with his megalomania is the whole reason I've only worked with CGI aliens since then. Seriously, the day he finally got back on his spaceship and left Hollywood forever was the happiest of my life.'

Pepper' Comes Out About Once Every Month,"BOSTON'Dispelling the widely held notion that musical work of such a high caliber is uncommon, an analysis by Boston University music historians published Thursday found that albums as good as Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band are actually released about once a month. 'Although the iconic Beatles record has reached a level of acclaim that seems untouchable, it appears that albums equally as groundbreaking reliably come out about 12 times every single year,' said lead author Regina Dirks, adding that since the most popular Beatles album was released in 1967, almost 600 albums of comparable quality and creativity have also been produced. 'From folk to jazz, rock to hip hop, we have seen records with songs just as innovative as 'Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds' or 'A Day in the Life' roughly once every four weeks. Frankly, it's disappointing that people have glorified Sgt. Pepper to the detriment of all of these other astonishing releases.' Dirks went on to say, however, that there still hasn't been anything made that is nearly as pioneering or essential as 1996's Turn the Radio Off by ska band Reel Big Fish.","music, entertainment, news, vol 53 issue 45, entertainment"

530,Beyoncé Begins Painful Surgical Transformation To Prepare For Role In Live-Action 'Lion King' Remake,"NEW YORK'In a move that many observers say underscores her commitment to the part, Beyoncé reportedly began a painful surgical transformation Thursday in preparation for her role as the lioness Nala in the live-action remake of The Lion King. 'It will take many intensive and frankly excruciating procedures before she gets to where she needs to be, but once the radical alterations to her bones, musculature, and skin are completed, you won't even be able to tell that the big cat you're looking at on screen is actually Beyoncé,' said plastic surgeon Dr. Scott Olmedo, adding that the process would begin with breaking and readjusting the pop star's spinal column and pelvic bones to allow her to comfortably walk quadrupedally. 'Once we've severed and reattached her muscles along her modified skeleton, we can then restructure her phalanges to function as paws, graft actual lion fur over the entirety of her flesh, and finally, once the swelling has subsided, implant the whiskers and tail.' Olmedo went on to say that he was confident the procedures would go more smoothly than they did for John Oliver, who is slated to play the bird Zazu and who contracted a severe infection after his body rejected its new beak.","entertainment, movies, beyonce, vol 53 issue 44, entertainment"

I've come to terms with the fact that my past behavior hurt many people and that it's never, ever okay to be attracted to men. I'm sorry.' Spacey went on to say that he hoped to resume his career once he had put his homosexuality behind him but understood if people chose not to forgive him.","entertainment, news, vol 53 issue 44, entertainment"

'If a band is headed to my neighborhood for a show next weekend, or if they're playing 500 miles away six months from now, I absolutely want to know as soon as Live Nation can alert me,' said Dawles, adding that the degree to which he knows about or enjoys the artist in question should have no bearing on the volume of email notifications he receives. 'There is not a minute in the day when I don't want to be notified about where Beck, Sia, Halsey, Imagine Dragons, Alabama Shakes, Paramore, Paul McCartney, and Papa Roach are performing'doesn't matter what venue, or what country, or whether I can get there, or whether I want to. I'd love if Live Nation could just keep me updated about everything, without pause. Maybe they could use push notifications, too?' At press time, Dawles was reportedly too busy to attend any of this weekend's concerts in Miami, Ft. Lauderdale, Kansas City, St. Louis, Berlin, Barcelona, Seoul, and Vancouver, but he was thrilled that the mobile entertainment service had given him a heads-up.","music, business, corporations, vol 53 issue 42, entertainment"
533,Nation's Entertainment Reporters Return To Celeb Beach Body Beat Following Coverage Of Weinstein Scandal,"LOS ANGELES'Saying they felt a renewed sense of duty to expose unsightly cellulite and fashion missteps, the nation's entertainment reporters returned to the celebrity beach body beat Thursday after two weeks of covering sexual assault allegations against Harvey Weinstein. 'For a while there, it was all hands on deck to cover the breaking news of Weinstein's decades-long abuse of power'but now, it's back to our core mission of delivering highly unflattering shots of a pouchy-looking Leonardo DiCaprio in Malibu,' said reporter Darren Pallone, adding that setting aside the usual hunt for shots of Liam Hemsworth's rock-hard abs in order to prioritize the hundreds of victims of Weinstein's alleged assaults is 'all just part of the job.' 'Now that he's been ousted from the Motion Picture Academy, we can return to the important work of soliciting paparazzi photos of Amy Schumer adjusting her bikini straps in her own backyard and running it under the headline 'TOTAL TRAINWRECK.'' At press time, the reporter who spent a week confirming Weinstein's predation was an open secret systematically concealed by the Hollywood elite was hitting 'publish' on an article comparing the sagging abdomen of a middle-aged actress to that of a harbor seal.","entertainment, media, sexual harassment, celebrities, vol 53 issue 42, entertainment"
534,Historians Suggest 'Goodfellas' YouTube Clips May Be Fragments Of Larger Work,"LOS ANGELES'Saying there were too many similarities for it to be mere coincidence, historians from the University of Southern California suggested on Thursday that each of the Goodfellas clips on YouTube might be fragments of a larger artistic work. 'After analyzing more than 400 separate videos, I believe there is strong evidence linking the characters, settings, and dialogue to a broader narrative, possibly related to organized crime in the middle-to-late 20th century,' said USC film history professor Patrick Carnevale, theorizing that the teenage Henry Hill character who did small jobs for the neighborhood wiseguys and the adult Henry Hill who set up the Lufthansa heist were, in fact, one and the same. 'For instance, we originally thought a four-minute clip of Tommy getting insulted by Billy Batts in a Queens bar and later participating in his murder was its own distinct masterpiece, but when we looked at it in the broader context of clips featuring the disposal of Billy's body in upstate New York, we realized it could in fact be part of a larger narrative tapestry. Then we discovered a clip with some of the very same men sharing a spaghetti dinner in a luxurious prison cell, which was perhaps the best evidence to date that these were no isolated sequences, but components in what could quite possibly be a feature-length film.' Carnevale went on to say that despite the many clear connections among Goodfellas YouTube clips, no direct associations were as yet found between them and the Matrix recommendations in the sidebar.","entertainment, video, movies, internet, news in brief, vol 53 issue 41, entertainment"

'With so many awful things happening back-to-back, it just makes sense to plan a series of fundraising shows well in advance rather than scramble to throw one together after every single calamity,' said event organizer Marvin Beckett, who at the behest of all 323 million Americans will line up a full slate of performances from the music industry's top talents for the first Saturday of the month that will encompass any natural disasters or acts of mass violence that have occurred in the prior 30 days. 'This scheduling is just a more practical and efficient way for us as a nation to come together and support our fellow Americans when they need help most. If we can't stop these tragedies from happening, at least we can keep ourselves organized.' At press time, the American populace was reportedly open to the idea of weekly benefit concerts or a benefit concert that ran continuously and indefinitely.","entertainment, news, natural disasters, news in brief, vol 53 issue 40, entertainment"

'Fans of the franchise should brace themselves, because Death At Pooh Corner might just be the last time they ever see one of their favorite characters in the Hundred Acre Wood,' said Disney spokesperson Sarah Freeborn, alluding to the preview's opening shot showing Pooh jerking his head up after hearing a gunshot off in the distance and saying 'Oh, bother.' 'As suggested by the minor-key score and drab black-and-gray color palette of the trailer, tragedy is coming for Christopher Robin and his friends, all of whom will be stripped of their innocence in a single brutal act.'

'How was this allowed to happen in the year 2017?' said an exasperated Blanford, who reportedly has willfully refused to acknowledge let alone challenge suggestive comments made by coworkers toward female colleagues and the unwanted sexual advances made by his friends toward women at social gatherings. 'I know he's a powerful man, but that doesn't mean these disgusting things [that I deliberately choose to overlook in my own life or rationalize so quickly that it's barely even a conscious act] can just be tolerated.

541,Adult Film Industry Replaces 500 Porn Stars With Hydraulic Robotic Fisting Arm,"LOS ANGELES'Rendered obsolete by the robot's orifice-pounding abilities, nearly 500 porn stars were replaced this week by a hydraulic-powered fisting arm that industry reps said could go harder, faster, and longer than any of its human counterparts. 'In order to keep up with the growing demand for the filthiest, most insane hole-stretching action imaginable, production companies have had to augment their workforces with machines that can be programmed to fist around the clock with only the occasional application of lubricant,' said adult film producer Spike Oster, adding that the German-engineered robot was designed to plow elbow-deep into even the tightest of barely-legal slits. 'Obviously we respect the hard work and dedication of human actors, but having the option to employ just one fully detached arm that can be quickly customized according to the gender and ethnicity requirements of a film makes far more economic sense.' Oster went on to say that the laid-off porn stars would have no trouble finding new jobs, however, assuming they were willing to move to the emerging fisting markets of Asia and the Middle East.","entertainment, sex, news in brief, vol 53 issue 39, our annual year 2017, entertainment"

'We decided to just get it over with as quickly as possible, so as soon as shooting wrapped, we told her there was a pizza party for her behind the set on the soundstage,' said producer Charles Shyer, acknowledging that crew members instead seized the Lohan clone, strapped her to a chair, and used an IV to deliver a cocktail of lethal drugs into her bloodstream. 'It was kind of heartbreaking hearing the Lohan clone talk about how excited she was for the movie to come out and how she wanted to grow up to be a famous actress, but at least we used a better poison than the one they used on the Hayley Mills clone after the original 1961 Parent Trap, which apparently took hours to finally work.'

'From the moment we see her chewing the entrails of a bound-and-gagged man wrapped in coils of barbed wire, it's obvious this is a version of Taylor we definitely haven't seen before,' said Billboard magazine writer Joseph Wohl in a post analyzing the new song and its accompanying music video, which feature graphic images of self-mutilation, a bass line sampled from a recording of cattle slaughter, and multiple lyrical references to genocide. 'In the pre-chorus, when she sings, 'I'm going to hatefuck you till the worms feast on your eyes,' it's not clear if she's referring to ex-boyfriend Tom Hiddleston, her rival Katy Perry, or her ongoing feud with Kanye West. But it's obvious from the bursts of industrial noise and mid-song interlude involving an imagined phone call with serial killer John Wayne Gacy that this new Taylor isn't playing around.' At press time, several music blogs had reportedly criticized the single as overly derivative of artists like Throbbing Gristle and Anal Cunt as well as for appropriating imagery from Pier Pasolini's film, The 120 Days Of Sodom.","entertainment, news, music, taylor swift, news in brief, vol 53 issue 34, our annual year 2017, entertainment"

'Over the first six and a half seasons, we had been following closely along with the meticulous, rich details provided in our show's scripts, but once we got to the 'Spoils Of War' episode this season, we ran out of all written dialogue and plot and just pushed forward in a new direction from there,' said series co-creator and executive producer David Benioff, noting that the action on-screen during the past three episodes had not been based on any of the existing books, any of the scripts penned by the show's writing staff, or any material at all that had been preconceived and written down anywhere.

'I really fought with the studio on that, but ultimately they just weren't willing to pay for all the steaming-hot trays of lasagna you would want, from an artistic standpoint, to see at Connie Corleone's wedding reception,' said Coppola, noting that in the first shot he had hoped to put a big pan of lasagna on Vito Corleone's desk so the don could offer a piece to the weeping Bonasera, but due to budgetary restraints the man was instead given a shot of liquor. 'The few layers of pasta and ricotta and meat sauce you do see in the movie were made from Styrofoam to keep costs down. I was especially disappointed when we couldn't afford to film the singer Johnny Fontane putting down his microphone, picking up a spatula, and serving oversized helpings of lasagna to the bride and groom while the whole Corleone family looks on and laughs. I know you sometimes have to make compromises, but I sometimes wish I chose something else.' The director added that during the famous restaurant scene, he had originally wanted Michael Corleone to eat some lasagna, excuse himself to go to the bathroom'where his associates had secretly planted even more lasagna'and then emerge grinning with big, heaping platefuls of the dish for everyone.","entertainment, news, movies, news in brief, vol 53 issue 32, entertainment"

580,Report: South Korea Developing New Pop Group Capable Of Reaching U.S.,"WASHINGTON'Warning that a successful launch would constitute a grave threat to American population centers from coast to coast, leading analysts confirmed Wednesday that South Korea is currently developing a new pop group capable of reaching the United States. Experts stated that significant South Korean resources have been dedicated to the project of creating an intercontinental, all-girl supergroup, with a team of highly skilled producers, vocal coaches, and choreographers working in hidden rehearsal facilities to devise a strategic pop phenomenon that, if fully deployed, could inflict widespread devastation. 'We're far more vulnerable than we realize. This country isn't prepared at all for a full-scale album release.' 'Our analysis indicates this is an extremely powerful synth-driven bubblegum pop quintet'if it were to reach U.S. soil, the effects would be catastrophic for millions,' said Rita Bradley of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, referring to the group code-named TL-4125 but better known as SPLA$H in government circles. 'Despite decades of warnings from the international community, South Korea has persisted in conducting tests of radio-ready vocals and hip-hop-inspired dance moves. Their development of highly infectious hooks has also continued apace over the years.' 'We're far more vulnerable than we realize,' she added. 'This country isn't prepared at all for a full-scale album release.' Top-secret meetings were reportedly held this week after intelligence officials learned South Korea now possesses the drum machine technology necessary to synthesize a fully danceable breakbeat, a key step in the process of launching a tactical international debut single. Sound check footage obtained by the CIA suggests that the group has reached a far more advanced stage of development than previously thought and could mobilize for a world tour as soon as 2018. Speaking on condition of anonymity, a U.S. official told reporters that satellite imagery has revealed what appears to be an arena-sized stage set, with state-of-the-art recording studio complexes nearby. The official also said a Korean camera crew has been deployed to the same area, suggesting that a music video is in the works and that targeting the American charts may be within reach even sooner than feared. Long viewed as solely a regional threat, South Korea began conducting tests with smaller acts such as SG Wannabe and Brown Eyed Girls in the mid-2000s, and the limited range of those groups led most experts to consider the country's ambitions for a transpacific R&B-inflected musical sensation to be completely unrealistic. 'They've had the capability to hit Japan for a while now, but this is the first time they will be able to launch five singing-and-dancing pop idols in matching see-through baby-doll dresses directly at our shores,' said Douglas Reisenthaler, a professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies. 'The American populace is at risk of being exposed to their neon-dyed hair and cutesy uptempo electropop, the impact of which would be horrifying, especially if they were to drop a 15-track album without any prior warning. To be honest, this is the kind of thing that keeps me up at night'especially as a parent.' 'If the information we have is accurate, they are mere months away from having their first smash hit,' he added. According to sources, South Korean scientists were recently able to overcome long-standing problems controlling the highly unstable, potentially explosive chemistry between group members Q.U.E.E.N. Hyeung, Sunshine, Min-ji, DiA, and Stephanie. Officials in Seoul have reportedly discussed demonstrating their capabilities on state television with a 60-second promotional teaser from a music video that, were it to trend, would all but ensure total ruin on a continental scale. Federal officials have said the South Koreans still lack a vocal processor powerful enough to enrich SPLA$H's tracks with sufficient levels of Auto-Tune. In an effort to stymie their progress, the U.S. government imposes heavy economic sanctions against the nation's record industry, and it is believed to have conducted cyberattacks to corrupt files containing master tracks and lyrics. Highly placed sources confirmed officials have not ruled out the possibility of a preemptive attack before the teenage pop group's first concert. 'For decades, our popular music has been able to reach their country, and so South Koreans believe it is only fair they be allowed to possess such a deterrent themselves,' Bradley said. 'American leaders have turned a blind eye toward this situation for years, and now there's nothing we can do but attempt to delay it as long as possible. As soon as they figure out how to match an irresistible electronic groove with a flashy signature dance move, that's it.' She added, 'The second you hear that beat drop'boom'it's already over.'","entertainment, news, world, music, south korea, vol 53 issue 30, entertainment"

'It's a phenomenon we unfortunately observe from time to time: producers see that a certain true-crime doc is getting attention and then try to replicate it in hopes they'll get some of the spotlight too,' said critic Lauren Frye, noting that the many copycats of The Life And Death Of Ashley Dutcher all feature hallmarks of the original, including a small town, a murdered teenage girl, speculations about mishandled evidence, and home videos of the suspected killer as a child. 'It's absolutely sickening. We in the media have a responsibility to stop sensationalizing these derivative works with our coverage, because that's exactly what the horrifying people who make them crave. The best thing we all can do is simply look away.' Frye went on to say that while copycat documentaries couldn't be prevented altogether, fewer would be produced if people knew they'd have to upload it themselves to YouTube and hope even a hundred people watched.","entertainment, news, crime, movies, news in brief, vol 53 issue 29, entertainment"

'It's definitely not the direction we intended to go in, but Flea started slapping this funky bass line that got everyone thinking about the pristine waters of the Piscataqua River. Before I knew it, I'd already freestyled two verses about how freaky it is that the state doesn't have a sales tax.' At press time, the band had unintentionally recorded an entire double-length New England'themed concept album.","entertainment, news, music, news in brief, vol 53 issue 25, entertainment"

597,Chuck E. Cheese Keyboardist Quits Band To Form Mr. Munch Experience,"EDISON, NJ'Citing creative differences that had been festering for at least a decade, Chuck E. Cheese keyboardist Mr. Munch confirmed Wednesday that he had left the band to form a new prog-rock outfit, The Mr. Munch Experience. The longtime Chuck E. Cheese performer, whose songwriting credits include such hits as 'You're A Winner' and 'The Future Looks Fun To Me,' told reporters that while he was proud of what the band had accomplished musically, he had begun to feel stifled by the group's 'mainstream sound' and 'repetitive birthday-themed set list.' 'Sure, part of me still loves jamming about eating pizza and having fun with your friends, but there's so much more to being an artist than just showing up and singing the same 20 songs over and over,' said Mr. Munch, complaining that the group hadn't put out any new material since the commercial, radio-friendly 'Giant Armadillo Named Phil.' 'But anytime I suggested we push ourselves in a more experimental direction, that we not be afraid to challenge kids a little, Chuck just shot me down.' 'I guess you gotta know when to pack it in,' Mr. Munch added. 'If nothing else, I'll never have to sing 'so let's have a party' ever again.' According to the keyboardist, The Mr. Munch Experience would ideally resemble something of an 'aural journey,' taking listeners to far-off soundscapes where strands of mozzarella stretch across infinity and sauce erupts from marinara volcanoes. Without the constraints of an established sound, Mr. Munch reportedly plans to explore ideas like polyrhythms, slide whistles, microtones, and confetti cannons'all of which would have clashed with the Chuck E. Cheese band's more traditional, pop-oriented format. The Mr. Munch Experience would ideally resemble something of an 'aural journey,' taking listeners to far-off soundscapes where strands of mozzarella stretch across infinity and sauce erupts from marinara volcanoes. Mr. Munch explained that his new project would have a much more free-form style that wouldn't be afraid to 'get a little cosmic.' He added that he had just finished a rough demo of a 12-part song, an ambient 'synth voyage' titled 'Gooey Galactic' that culminated with a long fade-out of him whispering the word 'toppings' in reverse. The musician also confirmed he had already begun collaborating with longtime friend and Parliament-Funkadelic bass player Bootsy Collins on an epic 40-minute 'rebirthing' of 'If You're Happy And You Know It.' 'One of the things I'm most excited about is this multi-part rock opera called 'Pepperonium' that takes place in the year 2790 on a planet made entirely of melted cheese,' said Mr. Munch, describing how the idea came to him during a recent peyote session with his girlfriend, a 19-year-old Chuck E. Cheese's waitress who chants atonally in the song's background. 'It's going to be wild. I recorded the sound of a wooden paddle sliding under a pizza in a scorching-hot oven. It's just three seconds long, but we slowed it down to four minutes.' 'The lead single is about how we're all living on a single ball in a gigantic ball pit,' Mr. Munch continued. 'It's a total mindfuck.' Mr. Munch, who reiterated that he still had the utmost respect for his former bandmates' technical chops, admitted that they had drifted apart due to a toxic mix of personalities'a rift that was compounded by their grueling 365-days-a-year performance schedule. 'Chuck and I have been good buds from back in the day, but I've never seen eye to eye with Jasper T. Jowls,' said Mr. Munch, referring to the group's lead guitarist, whom he claimed was an out-of-control drunk who 'always played over everyone.' 'I'm here to make music, but Pasqually P. Pieplate and Helen Henny were constantly bringing their personal stuff onstage every damn night, like anyone at a birthday party is supposed to care.' 'Boy, am I glad to be done with that bullshit,' added Mr. Munch. Representatives from Chuck E. Cheese's confirmed that they had already replaced Mr. Munch by signing Country Bear Jamboree's Liver Lips McGrowl.","entertainment, news, music, vol 53 issue 24, entertainment"

'Our poll shows that a record 64 percent of moviegoers in the U.S. are now comfortable with the idea of Wonder Woman being a woman,' said the report's lead author, Rebecca Pohlman, explaining that in the past decade the nation has grown more supportive of a female Diana, Princess of Themyscira, even though as recently as 1990 less than 10 percent of Americans thought an actress should play the part of the Amazonian superhero. 'Still, this remains a highly polarizing issue, as 31 percent of those surveyed claimed they couldn't possibly imagine Wonder Woman as anything other than a male. Even a sizable minority of those who said they were potentially open to a female Wonder Woman said they would remain skeptical until they could judge the portrayal with their own eyes.' While the poll suggested that the nation was increasingly receptive to women taking on more diverse roles, the survey also found that only 28 percent of Americans were amenable to a black Black Panther.","entertainment, news, media, culture, gender, news in brief, vol 53 issue 22, entertainment"

623,"Judi Dench, Jack Nicholson, Jeremy Irons, Meryl Streep Fondly Recall Getting Start As Part Of 1993 Mouseketeer Class","LOS ANGELES'Remembering the many great friendships and opportunities it brought into their lives, a group of Hollywood stars including Judi Dench, Jack Nicholson, Jeremy Irons, and Meryl Streep recalled Thursday getting their start on The All New Mickey Mouse Club in 1993. The group of A-listers, who began their careers on the popular children's variety show along with other notable cast members such as Christina Aguilera, Justin Timberlake, and Britney Spears, warmly reminisced to reporters about what it was like to have been part of such a talented group of performers, and how they owed much of their subsequent success to the exposure and experience the early '90s Disney Channel program brought them. 'The Mickey Mouse Club was the launching pad for so many of us,' said Streep, explaining how the show was vital to helping her land roles in The Bridges Of Madison County and Marvin's Room. 'I'd been in a couple of smaller things before it, but nothing prepared me for being up on that Disney stage doing 'The Mickey Mouse March''I mean, that was the big time. When you're a Mouseketeer, you're a household name.' 'All of a sudden, agents started calling,' Streep added. 'Real Hollywood agents.' Judi Dench, who prior to The Mickey Mouse Club had appeared mostly in plays, credited her time on the show with teaching her the practical skills she would need to thrive in the rough-and-tumble film industry. The star of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel also candidly told reporters that the ice cream shop skit she appeared in provided her with a better education in acting than any performing arts school could. Fellow class of '93 alumnus Jack Nicholson expressed similar sentiments, saying that all the while he was having fun covering Shanice's 'I Love Your Smile' in a duet with Christina Aguilera, he was growing up, too. 'When I first joined The Mickey Mouse Club I was so green,' said Nicholson, who would go on to win the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1998. 'I was this naïve 56-year-old from New Jersey, but singing and dancing to those '90s pop hits and classic Disney tunes five days a week helped me develop as a performer and as a person. Plus, it really helped having an old hand like JC Chasez there to take me under his wing.' Added Nicholson, 'To this day I still know all the steps to the 'Super Goofy Shuffle.'' Nicholson went on to note how lucky he felt to have been plucked from obscurity and land a featured role on such a high-profile showcase for young entertainers. He said some of his favorite memories from 'back in the day' included putting on his official Mickey Mouse'emblazoned letterman's jacket for the first time, touring Disney stores and theme parks all over the country, and seeing an unknown Daniel Day-Lewis'then barely 36'audition for the show and sensing that, though he wasn't cast, he'd still be a star someday. But the job also came with its share of stress, according to Jeremy Irons, who said spending so much time away from friends and family was often difficult and was not made any easier by the shock of suddenly being recognized as a Mouseketeer almost everywhere. 'Back in the '90s it seemed like every girl in America had a Jeremy Irons poster hanging in her bedroom,' said Irons, adding that tensions arose among cast members who weren't considered one of the 'cute ones' and weren't natural singers or dancers. 'And there were the love triangles, of course. I remember Justin Timberlake had the biggest crush on Judi Dench, which made things really awkward when he started dating Britney [Spears].' 'At the end of the day, though, we always tried to put those disagreements behind us,' Irons continued. 'Because we knew we were all there for the same reasons: We loved to sing, we loved to dance, and we loved Mickey.'","entertainment, disney, movies, news, vol 53 issue 14, entertainment"
624,I Wouldn't Have Invented The Piano If I Knew That Guy In 'The Godfather' Was Going To Get Strangled With Piano Wire,"Inventing the piano was the culmination of my life's work. A keyboard instrument unmatched in dynamic range and nuance of expression, it forever changed the way music was composed, performed, and enjoyed. It filled concert halls with a revolutionary new sound that has enchanted listeners for more than three centuries. And yet, I only feel bitter regret, knowing that my cherished invention led to that guy from The Godfather getting strangled with piano wire. The profound artistic achievements made possible by my creation are wondrous, to be sure, but they aren't worth more than a human life, especially that of Don Corleone's most trusted bodyguard. With the piano, I devised a stringed keyboard instrument that gave players a broader palette of tone colors and allowed for more precise rhythmic articulations. It took these tools of stylistic interpretation and placed them, quite literally, at the performer's fingertips. As proud as I am of this innovation, if I'd had any idea that someone would one day lift open the top of my beloved creation, unwind one of the strings from its pegs, and use it as a makeshift garrote on that unsuspecting henchman, I would've scrapped the whole project immediately. It just tears me up inside, thinking about the life he might have lived if I hadn't invented the literal instrument of his death. From what I understand, he was a rising star within his crime syndicate. I've no doubt he had a great future ahead of him. Thanks to me, though, that future was ruthlessly snuffed out. In my vanity, I never stopped to think about the full consequences of my actions. How could I have been so selfish? My invention may have given us the breathtaking sonatas of Beethoven and the masterful concerti of Rachmaninoff, but what it has taken away'the life of this man'is too much to bear. When I was building my first piano, I thought only of the gift I might impart to lovers of music. The worst thing I imagined happening was someone accidentally getting their fingers caught in its lid! I never, ever thought my invention would be the downfall of the man who wrought vengeance upon all six would-be assassins of Don Corleone, got the singer Johnny Fontane out of his exploitive contract, and gave the most generous cash gift to Connie on her wedding day. Some people delight in the sweet flow of Debussy's arabesques or the feathery bounce of Chopin's waltzes. Others marvel at how innovators from Franz Liszt to Thelonious Monk to John Cage pushed the potential of my piano to its very limits. But what do I hear? Nothing but the gags and retches of a loyal associate who was just doing his job by gathering information on the Tattaglia family. I can't help but feel as though I lashed that wire around his neck with my own hands. I've spent so much time rationalizing and making excuses in my head. Someone else would've invented the piano if not me, right? Or surely the Tattaglias would've found a different instrument to kill that guy with, if not the piano. Perhaps they would have crushed his head between two cymbals, stabbed him through the back of the neck with a flute, or ambushed him and bludgeoned him to death with bassoons. But I'm kidding myself. When I hear the word 'piano,' all I can think of is that bodyguard's bulging eyes and his last gurgling breath. I am certain that his last thought was to curse the name of Bartolomeo Cristofori and the day I unveiled my first cimbalo di cipresso di piano e forte in 1700. Believe me, I curse that day, too.","opinion, entertainment, history, commentary, vol 53 issue 14, bartolomeo cristofori of padua, entertainment"
625,Tips For Writing A Screenplay,"Every great writer must start somewhere. Begin by pouring $156,000 into an undergraduate degree. Your screenplay should address a central unifying question, such as 'How do we as humans transcend the tragedy of loss?' or 'What have those Smurfs been up to lately?' Shatter the conventional expectations for female leads by developing a protagonist who is both intelligent and attractive'but who knows how to crack a joke, too. Consider including at least one character named Big Jeff. Anytime you use 'FADE OUT' at the end of a scene, remember that the audience can't see anything that's happening until you fade back in. Indicate clearly at the beginning of each scene how VFX will make it worth watching. Take an occasional step back to review your script and double-check that a sense of artistic validation isn't obstructing its commercial viability. Once your first draft is finished, scan for spelling errors, then crack open a pack of brass fasteners.","entertainment, tips, infographic, vol 53 issue 14, entertainment"

'Everyone spent the whole season wondering if it was ever going to happen, so it was really satisfying when the two animals at long last ended up with each other,' said Entertainment Weekly writer Benjamin Lynch, describing the moment late in the episode when the mountain-dwelling cat and the bird of prey passionately embraced one another on a windswept stretch of the Tibetan plateau. 'The chemistry between them was obvious to everyone watching the show, and it was clear that they had strong feelings for one another, but there were still so many times where it seemed like they'd wind up with other wildlife. They're opposites in a lot of ways'different biomes, different prey'so seeing that storyline resolve so nicely was truly heartwarming.' Lynch added that the episode made up for the widely panned finale of the original Planet Earth, in which the fan favorite green sea turtle was controversially killed off by a spider crab for reasons that were never fully explained.","entertainment, animals, nature, news in brief, vol 53 issue 13, entertainment"

632,Report: Economy Must Be Doing Pretty Well If Entire Season Of 'Bones' Online For Free,"NEW YORK'Predicting the country will soon reach levels of employment and household wealth it has not seen in decades, top financial experts concluded Tuesday that the economy must really be surging right now if an entire season of Bones is available to watch online for free. 'If they're just giving away the complete 11th season of a hit TV show to anyone with internet access, then I think that leaves little doubt that we're on the cusp of a new golden age of economic prosperity marked by rapid wage growth and significant expansion of the nation's GDP,' said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, who, after finding 22 episodes of the crime procedural starring Emily Deschanel and David Boreanaz streaming in their entirety free of charge, also forecasted a sizable uptick in corporate earnings and sales of new and existing homes. 'If the reports are true that every episode of the 12th and final season will also be available online at no cost, it seems pretty safe to say that we have entered promising new economic boom times, and we should expect to see a strong dollar, soaring consumer confidence, and the entire manufacturing sector springing back to life all across the United States.' At press time, Zandi acknowledged economic growth might not be as robust as he had initially thought, citing a paywall he discovered when trying to access episodes of FX's legal thriller Damages.","entertainment, news, economy, news in brief, vol 53 issue 12, entertainment"
633,Friend Of Bruce Springsteen Has Been Thinking Of Excuses To Avoid Checking Out His Band For 50 Years,"FREEHOLD, NJ'Saying it hasn't always been easy inventing reasons for not attending one of his gigs, local man John Gilman, 68, told reporters Thursday that he has spent approximately 50 years coming up with excuses to avoid checking out the band of high school classmate Bruce Springsteen. An insurance adjuster and friend of Springsteen since the mid-1960s when the acclaimed singer-songwriter played small venues in Monmouth County, New Jersey, Gilman told reporters that over the past half century he has falsely cited homework, car trouble, his kids' baseball games, and late nights at the office as just a few of the reasons he could not be present at Springsteen's shows. 'After the first few times I told him I couldn't make it, I thought he'd take the hint and figure I just wasn't interested, but he's never stopped asking,' said Gilman, who hastened to add that he couldn't be happier his friend's band is doing so well. 'I love Bruce, but it's kind of a hassle to drop everything on a Friday night and drive up to Madison Square Garden or wherever. So I tell him I'm too busy to make it this time, but to count me in next time. I've been doing that since I was 17 years old.' 'I remember back in '87 he gave me an early demo of Tunnel Of Love and told me he thought I'd really like it,' Gilman continued. 'I thanked him and said I'd give it a listen, but to be honest, it's just been sitting in a drawer.' In the decades since his friend formed the E Street Band and began to earn widespread critical accolades for albums like The Wild, The Innocent & The E Street Shuffle, Gilman confirmed he has lied about his absence at Springsteen's concerts by claiming he was sick 37 times, had a dinner party to attend 29 times, was out of town for a cousin's wedding 18 times, and, on seven occasions, had to get up early the next morning for a dentist appointment. According to Gilman, the closest he has come to actually seeing his friend play was a night in 1971 when he walked by the Upstage Club in Asbury Park, noticed Springsteen's band was on the bill, and briefly considered going inside. He ultimately concluded, however, that the venue was too crowded and would probably be too hot as well. 'It was really hard when he did that 10-night stand at the Meadowlands, because I had to come up with something new to tell him every night,' said Gilman, referring to Springsteen's legendary series of performances at Giants Stadium during his 2003 tour for The Rising. 'It was really sweet of him to send me front row tickets to all of those shows, but big, loud concerts like that just aren't my thing, you know?' 'Now anytime he has that many dates scheduled in New Jersey, I make sure to tell him I'm on vacation,' added Gilman. To Gilman's surprise, the multiplatinum recording artist has only grown more insistent in recent years, even going so far as to send him a copy of 2012's Grammy-nominated Wrecking Ball and then call him a few days later to ask if he liked it. In order to avoid wounding his friend's pride, Gilman reportedly glanced at the track list and remarked that 'Easy Money' was 'really great,' despite having never listened to it or any other song in Springsteen's 18-album catalog. 'Sometimes I get lucky and there's a real-life event I can use as an excuse, like that time in '93 when an accident in the Lincoln Tunnel had traffic backed up so bad I wouldn't have been able to make it to his MTV Unplugged taping even if I'd wanted to,' Gilman said. 'But for the most part, it just gets harder over the years. There are only so many ways I can change the subject when he asks if I've gotten around to checking out 'Built To Run' or whatever.' 'I do occasionally feel guilty,' he added. 'I mean, Bruce and his bandmates have helped me move like half a dozen times.'","entertainment, news, music, vol 53 issue 11, our annual year 2017, entertainment"
634,"DC Executive Worried Batgirl Script Not Interesting Enough To Be Movie, 3 More Movies, 2028 Reboot And 4 More Movies","BURBANK, CA'While giving creative notes on the screenplay in a Friday meeting, DC Comics president Geoff Johns reportedly said he was concerned that a recent draft of the Batgirl: Origins script was not compelling enough to support a movie, three more movies, a 2028 reboot, and four additional movies. 'Frankly, I just don't see this having the legs to carry a feature film, a follow-up trilogy, a video game franchise, and then another prequel trilogy,' Johns said, adding that while the script's first act 'definitely works,' he worried the narrative would drag when stretched to a full 90-minute runtime, several more 90-minute runtimes, and a dozen more 50-minute runtimes as part of the Netflix tie-in series. 'I'm just worried this starts running out of steam well before the end of the movie, the comic book adaptation, and the standalone spinoff movies telling the Huntress's backstory. If a narrative can't even sustain a single movie and a Lego set, let alone more than one syndicated animated series, maybe it needs some heavy revisions.' At press time, DC executives had decided to ask for a total rewrite after concluding villain Killer Moth was not an interesting enough antagonist to hold people's interest for two hours and the length of several Six Flags roller coasters.","entertainment, news, movies, comics, news in brief, vol 53 issue 11, entertainment"

640,Study Finds Exposure To Violent Children Causes Increased Aggression In Video Game Characters,"CHAPEL HILL, NC'Suggesting a dangerous and potentially deadly connection, a study published Monday by the University of North Carolina found that exposure to violent children causes increased aggression in video game characters. 'Our research shows that video game characters who regularly spend time with violent youths show a far greater propensity to act out destructively themselves,' said lead author Will Garland, whose team examined video game characters across an array of consoles and genres, and found consistently higher levels of antisocial conduct among those that frequently engaged with an aggressive child. 'Even spending 30 minutes a day with these children can increase violent, even sadistic behaviors among video game characters, such as running over pedestrians with a car or bashing adversaries with the butt of a machine gun before riddling their already dead body with bullets.' According to Garland, the research also suggests that video game characters exposed to violent children demonstrate reckless disregard for their own safety in the form of leaping off buildings, clouds, or other high platforms.","entertainment, news, video games, children, news in brief, vol 53 issue 09, entertainment"

The Academy Awards, now in its 89th year, is a grand and glamorous tribute to the touching performances and technical artistry that, over the past 12 months, made us laugh, cry, and feel closer together. However, given all the joy and entertainment that the film industry has provided to the viewing public, it is the firm belief of this newspaper that these accomplished thespians, screenwriters, directors, and producers deserve far more than just the three and a half hours of recognition they will receive during tonight's ceremony. Which is why The Onion is extending a formal invitation to all those in attendance at this evening's Oscars to join us at our official Academy Awards after-party in the village of Sakteng, Bhutan. While there will be no shortage of glitzy soirees in the Los Angeles area following the conclusion of the festivities at the Dolby Theatre, none of them can match the atmosphere and monastic solitude that The Onion's post-show extravaganza will provide. We would be honored to host the greatest artistic minds of the movie industry for an evening of silent prayer, butter tea, archery, and A-list company in the high-elevation yak pastures of the Eastern Himalayas.

Sakteng, Bhutan Traditional dress and supplemental oxygen will be provided. As soon as the night's final awards are handed out and the televised broadcast comes to a close, you will head to LAX, where our plane will be waiting to take you on the 16-hour flight to Paro International Airport outside of Thimphu. After a three-hour single-engine plane ride to Yongphulla, you and your fellow stars and starlets will transfer to the waiting four-by-four vehicles for the one-hour drive to Trashigang and the ensuing 90-minute drive to Phongmey village, before beginning the first leg of a two-day sherpa-guided trek to our party tent. After a quick 24-hour altitude acclimation at the base camp, you will simply make your way over the Nachungla Pass at 13,625 feet before beginning your five-hour descent into the Sakteng valley, where you and the rest of Hollywood's luminaries will change out of your tuxedos and gowns and into traditional yak-hair robes and five-spouted shamo hats, which will be freshly pressed and waiting. The party will run from 9 p.m. until midnight. Guests will be welcomed upon arrival into Sakteng by local Buddhist monks playing a chorus of dungchen horns as servers offer a traditional spread of hot distilled rice-maize liquor with scrambled eggs. But the splendors of the event do not stop there: Guests will be treated to ceremonial ablutions, followed by a mask dance and an hour of chanted blessings to mountain goddess Jomo Kuengkhar. All attendees are requested to bring an insulated parka, a waterproof hat and gloves, hiking boots, thermal undergarments, a sturdy aluminum-framed backpack, eight liters of water per person, a headlamp, an ice ax, and a desire to carouse the night away with the rest of the big screen's biggest names. In addition to experiencing the excitement and contemplative desolation of The Onion's after-party, those who attend will also receive a complimentary gift bag, which will include a five-pound sack of red rice, a bolt of handwoven fabric, 10 feet of rope, and an 8,500-ngultrum gift certificate to the dagger shop in Samdrup Jongkhar District.

Here are The Onion's picks for who should take home the coveted Oscar statuettes: La La Land (Best Picture): Damien Chazelle's masterpiece blew the competition out of the water in terms of how many songs are in it Natalie Portman (Best Actress): Narrowly edges out Meryl Streep for her superior portrayal of a rich socialite with an infamously bad voice I Am Not Your Negro (Best Documentary Feature): Brilliantly tackles issues of race and discrimination in America, and viewers who haven't seen it yet can rest assured that it will remain relevant for the next eight to nine decades at least My Life As A Zucchini (Best Animated Feature Film): Academy voters won't be able to resist this unique opportunity to fuck up everyone's Oscar ballots Walt Disney Studios (Best Return On Investment): Disney's diverse, well-managed portfolio of reliable franchises was a smash hit among investors and financiers alike Arrival (Best Adapted Screenplay): A film that rose to the immense challenge of adapting the script from its nonlinear, heptapodic source material The White Helmets (Best Documentary Short Subject): All due respect to other heart-wrenching Syrian civil war stories nominated, but George Clooney's involved here Sully (Sound Editing): No movie did a better job capturing the sound of geese getting just fucking shredded in an airplane's turbine than Sully","entertainment, oscars, movies, infographic, vol 53 issue 07, entertainment"

661,Report: Women Only Made Up 2.7% Of Video Game Bosses Last Year,"DURHAM, NC'After surveying hundreds of dungeons and arenas across an array of digital realms, a new report released Wednesday by Duke University's Fuqua School of Business found that women only made up 2.7 percent of video game bosses last year. 'Despite changing perceptions in society at large, we found that in 2016, only one in approximately 50 female supervillains reported holding a leadership position in which she got to guard important artifacts or power-ups,' read the report in part, adding that even the most colossal cybernetic alien huntresses were far more likely to serve as minibosses or just minions in a larger swarm of enemies than the final combatant in a quest, much less an entire game. 'Additionally, heroes only reported getting 79 percent as many coins for beating female bosses as they did male ones. While there are certainly some prominent female bosses, such as Vicar Amelia, the mummified wolf-deer hybrid beast from Bloodborne, there still remain many institutional barriers blocking female monsters, zombies, and supernatural assassins from advancing in their respective levels.' The report ultimately concluded that while change was possible, it would not come quickly and, in fact, may take several console generations.","entertainment, news, technology, women, video games, news in brief, vol 53 issue 05, entertainment"

'We're hoping to make up the ground we lost with white working-class voters and union members who once made up our base with a new 10-part hip-hop musical set in rural Wisconsin, featuring a down-on-her-luck manufacturing worker played by Lena Dunham,' said DNC interim chair Donna Brazile, who added that, in an effort to appeal to economically distressed voters, each episode would see the protagonists tackle a different theme, such as taxes or free trade, through the choreography of five-time Tony winner Susan Stroman. 'We are confident that with the help of Josh Gad, Debra Messing, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, and the creative team behind The Mindy Project, we can bring Americans who feel like they have been left behind by globalization back to the Democratic Party. Viewers will also have the chance to win a trip to be in the audience at a live TED Talk taping if they share the series on Instagram, which we believe will draw considerable interest across the nation's heartland.' Brazile added that the web series would be available exclusively through Seeso and HBO Go.","entertainment, democrats, politics, lena dunham, celebrities, culture, internet, news in brief, vol 52 issue 45, entertainment"

'Oh, now you want to ask me if I'm ready to rock? Well, guess what? It's too late for that.

'We're happy to report that the surgery went smoothly, and beginning today, Mr. Burns will no longer be limited to perceiving the world in shades of black, white, and sepia, and will instead be able to experience the entire spectrum of hues that most of us take for granted,' said Dr. Amrita Singh, noting that the 63-year-old director and producer of The Civil War, Prohibition, and Jazz had awakened from anesthesia and was reported to be marveling at the vividness of his surroundings, human faces, and photographs. 'It appears that the removal of this tumor also reduced intense pressure that had built up inside Mr. Burns' visual processing center; as a result, his eyesight has sharpened considerably, and he'll notice that he won't need to lean in close anymore to make out the details of images. It's going to seem like a whole new world to him.' Dr. Singh added that an additional inner-ear surgery would be required to correct the balance issue that causes Burns to slowly drift from left to right.","entertainment, news, ken burns, celebrities, healthcare, news in brief, vol 52 issue 43, entertainment"

'The shows we're seeing right now are incredibly smart and cinematic in scope'television has reached its pinnacle,' said profoundly ignorant HBO executive Julien Rhodes, who has yet to greenlight a show featuring an army of advanced cyborg warlocks who were created in a lab and armed with a full database of knowledge about the dark arts in order to fight evil spirits besieging our world. 'You can turn on the TV any night of the week and find multiple complex, beautifully told stories on just about every subject [except robot wizards falling in love with one another, and occasionally their human creators, while fending off malevolent forces of untold power using hexes programmed into their hard drives]. We're lucky to have access to such a breadth of exceptional programming.'

'Following an exhaustive six-year audit of our collection, we determined that nearly half the books, recordings, films, photographs, and manuscripts in our archives were of such little consequence to the cultural canon that they were worthy of complete eradication from the American consciousness,' said Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden, explaining that institution officials had, as of this morning, finished incinerating the final batch of meaningless creations, including 15 tons of outdated medical texts, hundreds of 19th-century telegraph line maps, and the 2010 motion picture The Last Airbender, in order to ensure they were not preserved for future generations. 'In some cases, such as our vast troves of military march sheet music and photographic negatives of rural Americans quilting, works were selected for destruction based on their lack of artistic merit, while others, like Styx's The Serpent Is Rising and the movie sequel Grease 2, represent the nadir of a particular historical era. Wiping out these terrible pieces is vitally important to maintaining our proud, rich cultural heritage.'

'This project is going to explore exactly who these dishonest little sons of bitches think they're fooling by claiming they sat down and watched the whole damn thing. There's even some rare footage of a few of these pieces of shit talking about my depiction of Benny Carter, which wasn't even in the fucking film.'

'I distinctly remember my dad and I sitting in front of the living room TV as we watched Gandalf fall'I remember just staring in total shock,' said Peter Lee of Anaheim, CA, one of the 1,500 individuals surveyed for the poll, which found that many Americans possessed near-photographic memories of their precise location, who they were with, as well as the emotions experienced upon seeing Balrog wrap his fiery whip around Gandalf's legs. 'We couldn't believe it was actually happening. That moment is seared into my brain. I'll never forget watching Gandalf tumble down and say 'Fly, you fools' just before plummeting into the darkness. Things were never really the same again after that.' The poll also showed that many Americans later struggled to broach the subject of Gandalf falling into the bottomless pit with their young children.","entertainment, movies, history, news in brief, vol 52 issue 36, entertainment"
693,Hollywood Refusing To Give Public Any New Movies Until It Can Appreciate Ones It Already Has,"LOS ANGELES'In a joint statement confirming that all production would cease immediately, representatives from every Hollywood film studio announced Friday that audiences would not be given any new movies to watch until they had learned to appreciate the ones they already have. The declaration, which was endorsed by all working members of the industry, observed that there are plenty of existing films the American public doesn't ever bother to watch, and explained that viewers would henceforth receive no new box-office openings and would simply have to make do with the current back catalog of movies. 'There will be no more thrillers, comedies, or any of those sequels you've been asking for until you can show us you're grateful for the more than 100 years of cinema we've already given you,' Warner Bros. CEO Kevin Tsujihara told reporters, noting that Hollywood had made tens of thousands of titles for the U.S. populace, and yet it was always asking for more. 'We've really tried to give you films we think you'd like, but there are quite a few that you've never even given a viewing. These things aren't cheap, you know?' 'For God's sake, some of you have only seen Raging Bull once,' he added. Sources confirmed that movie lots and sound stages across Los Angeles County had gone dark following the announcement, with screenwriters, set designers, casting directors, cinematographers, and actors all leaving their offices and trailers to go home, where they planned to remain until the public 'did something about its behavior' and started having a better attitude toward the rich legacy of American film. The statement indicated that Hollywood wouldn't even consider making any new movies until viewers demonstrated sincere gratitude for the many cinematic achievements they had already been presented with, including the three-minute, 20-second tracking shot that opens Touch Of Evil, the use of Richard Strauss' Also Sprach Zarathustra in 2001: A Space Odyssey, the enigmatic ending of The Graduate, and the entire running time of Robert Altman's Nashville. 'Before complaining that there are no new westerns to see, how about you go watch one of the 140 or so movies John Ford made?' said Paramount executive LeeAnne Stables, adding that once the nation had fully appreciated the merits of The Searchers and Stagecoach, her industry might look into greenlighting another contribution to the genre. 'And remember how much you wanted Edge Of Tomorrow, and then we spent $178 million to make it for you and you didn't even go see it? Well, we're not doing anything like that again.' 'And don't come crying to us begging for something new with Jennifer Lawrence or those Avengers you like so much, because we're serious about this,' she continued. 'Honestly, you should just be thankful for what you have: The Godfather, Young Frankenstein, everything Isabella Rossellini's ever done, American Graffiti, the Toy Story franchise. You've got it pretty good, if you ask me.' Despite protestations from the public, top industry officials maintained they were adamant in their decision, saying that audiences nationwide would never learn to value the movies they had been given in the past if they were constantly being spoiled by a never-ending supply of brand-new biopics, costume dramas, animated features, and music documentaries. Moreover, they insisted there would be no more reboots or remakes until the public had seen every original film in full. 'Sure, we could give you a bunch of new romantic comedies, but first you're going to have to at least try to appreciate The Philadelphia Story and Harold And Maude,' filmmaker David Fincher said. 'If you can't learn to respect the talents of great leading men like Cary Grant, Marlon Brando, and Henry Fonda, then you don't deserve any new Chris Pratt vehicles for a long, long time.' At press time, reports confirmed an irate public was firing back at Hollywood by insisting it had never even asked for another Ben-Hur.","entertainment, movies, news, vol 52 issue 36, entertainment"

It went by so fast, though'I have to do it again!' said Matazaro, patting his shirt free of powdered sugar as he stood on his toes and craned his neck to get a better sense of how long he'd have to wait for another go at the freshly fried masses of batter. 'My stomach still feels a little queasy, but it'll probably settle down by the time I get to the front. Oh, man, I can't wait!' Matazaro added that this time around, he wouldn't hold back his excitement, saying he might get pretty loud when he reaches the best parts of the confection.","entertainment, food, travel, news in brief, vol 52 issue 21, entertainment"
717,Library Of Congress Adds 'No Sleep 'Til Hammersmith' To National Motörhead Registry,"WASHINGTON'In recognition of the 1981 live album's contribution to the metal pioneers' legacy, the Library of Congress announced Tuesday that No Sleep 'Til Hammersmith had been added to the National Motörhead Registry. 'Built on the successes of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre EP and the album Ace Of Spades, Hammersmith marks the absolute peak of the band's Lemmy, 'Fast' Eddie Clarke, and Phil 'Philthy Animal' Taylor lineup, making it an exemplary addition to the NMR,' Acting Librarian of Congress David S. Mao said of the database, a federally funded collection of over 800 albums, singles, and bootleg recordings from throughout the rock-and-roll band's 40-year career. 'Obviously, since there is so much deserving music, we have to be selective with what we include. When you consider that Hammersmith features such technically adept and aggressively loud songs as 'Overkill' and 'Capricorn' recorded live at Newcastle City Hall, the choice was obvious.' In conjunction with the announcement, officials from the Smithsonian Institution's Motörhead Collection confirmed they had acquired 100 empty bottles of Jack Daniels that Lemmy had consumed during the 1986 Orgasmatron tour.","entertainment, music, news in brief, vol 52 issue 21, entertainment"

'Prince was constantly creating throughout his career, and after finally accessing his vast trove of previously unheard music, we now know that he produced over 40,000 albums' worth of material that is, unfortunately, made up entirely of songs originally recorded by Billy Joel,' said attorney L. Londell McMillan, reluctantly admitting that Prince had produced at least 9,000 hours of 'Uptown Girl' covers alone. 'We regrettably found a slowed-down, 40-minute version of 'Scenes From An Italian Restaurant' from the late 1980s, as well as a melodic vocal-only version recorded more recently'and that's just the tip of the iceberg. It appears he was still recording pulsing, guitar-driven covers of 'She's Always A Woman' up until his death. Tragically, we could be hearing new Prince tracks covering Billy Joel classics for decades to come.' Dejected executors went on to announce they had discovered Prince's private journals containing hundreds of pages of additional, updated verses to 'We Didn't Start The Fire.'","entertainment, celebrities, death, music, news in brief, vol 52 issue 17, entertainment"

'Beyoncé's latest track is a spirited feminist anthem that sharply strikes at the patriarchy beginning with the opening verse, 'Ladies, don't ever let your man tell you what to do,' before offering potent validation to her predominantly female listeners by stating that 'High-quality streaming audio was made for queens like you,'' wrote New Yorker music critic Carrie Battan in a review of the new track, titled 'Rise (And Sign In),' which was accompanied by a lush music video depicting the 20-time Grammy winner sitting in the study of a mansion clad in a majestic, diamond-studded fur coat while entering her credit card information into an online form. 'She continues with even more pointed lyrics in the chorus: 'Boss-ass bitch going hard with that $9.99 plan; stunners going harder with the lossless $19.99, fam.' It's a true ode to female strength, and a stirring call to action to women to rise up together and assert their economic independence.' At press time, the song had already been posted on a torrent site, where millions had downloaded and circulated it free of charge.","entertainment, beyonce, business, music, news in brief, vol 52 issue 16, entertainment"

'After five unbearable seasons of constantly hearing how 'the books handled things much differently,' it's just so nice to know I won't have to deal with any of that shit this time around,' said White Plains, NY resident Cathryn Wakeman, echoing the sentiments of millions of viewers who had become exasperated by the incessant comments from 'all those little shits' about how the televised version of a battle strayed from the George R.R. Martin novels. 'Every time there was a slight deviation, one of those fuckers would have to chime in with how someone from the show was actually a composite of 'two way more interesting' characters from the book or how the producers left out a passage critical to understanding Westeros or some shit like that. Thank God those assholes just have to sit there and wait to find out what happens next like the rest of us.' Although the nation was looking forward to watching the fantasy show unbothered by annoying remarks from fans of the books, Americans said they wouldn't put it past the little pricks to butt in with fan theories they picked up online.","entertainment, television, news in brief, vol 52 issue 15, entertainment"

'I remember most of the characters' breasts, but there are just so many of them, and a lot of the time there's a bunch on the screen at once, so I felt I really needed to brush up on them just to be safe,' said Parker, who explained that even after regularly watching the show for five seasons, he still often becomes confused trying to keep track of all the various nipples. 'Sometimes I have a hard time following along with the storyline and I mistake Daenerys Targaryen's breasts for Margaery Tyrell's, since they're so similar-looking. Honestly, I had to watch the nude scenes set in Littlefinger's brothel a few times to remember which breasts were which.' Parker added that he was still upset the show killed off his favorite pair of breasts in season four.","entertainment, game of thrones, television, news in brief, vol 52 issue 15, entertainment"

730,Hollywood Stars Overthrown In Bloody C-List Uprising,"LOS ANGELES'Unleashing a brutal wave of violence and destruction that has upended the entire power structure of the entertainment industry overnight, the nation's C-list celebrities have carried out a bloody coup to overthrow the hottest stars in Hollywood, sources reported Tuesday. Armed hordes of lesser-known actors'who rampaged from studio to studio, setting fire to everything in their path and leaving the dismembered bodies of their A-list counterparts scattered across Los Angeles County'reportedly rose up and revolted after years of being passed over for leading roles, denied awards, and generally ignored by the media in favor of those with greater name recognition. 'We've tried to contain the damage, but much of the city is in flames, and a marauding faction, which appears to be led by actor Taye Diggs, is now in complete control of the area from Sunset Boulevard all the way down to Pico,' said L.A. police chief Charlie Beck, adding that the carnage began Monday when a contingent of actors from the TNT show Rizzoli & Isles stormed the Ivy Restaurant in West Hollywood and began slitting the throats of top-tier celebrities. 'We have at least 57 confirmed casualties, including Daniel Day-Lewis, Robert De Niro, and Sandra Bullock.' 'Unfortunately, heavy violence and bloodshed continue throughout much of the area,' added Beck, the sound of sirens and intermittent explosions audible behind him. 'I can confirm that the entire neighborhood of Brentwood has been lost.' Following decades of strained relations, tensions between actors of limited fame and the Hollywood elite are believed to have reached a boiling point yesterday when former child star Frankie Muniz was bumped from his slot on Jimmy Kimmel Live! after an interview with Channing Tatum ran longer than expected. Sources said word of the slight spread quickly, fomenting unrest and prompting calls for vengeance among the mildly famous. According to a shaken casting director who barely escaped the grisly scene, a group of actors auditioning for a small guest role on CSI: Cyber turned on the show's producers Monday afternoon and began systematically stringing up cast and crew members from a stoplight at a nearby intersection. By evening, minor celebrities, including John Larroquette and Raven-Symoné, were seen crashing a star-studded screening of The Jungle Book at the El Capitan Theatre, where they allegedly stormed the red carpet with machetes and massacred each of the movie's leads in front of the paparazzi. The rebellion's spokesman, former Star Trek: The Next Generation cast member Brent Spiner, appeared in a video alongside The Good Wife's Dylan Baker and Ashley Tisdale of the High School Musical franchise to detail the group's demands. 'It is we, the overlooked and the underpublicized, who today have made these streets run red with the blood of studio heads and beloved superstars,' Spiner said into the camera, standing near a shackled and gagged George Clooney. 'Henceforth, members of our ranks will be featured on magazine covers and given starring roles, and we will never again be made to perform in reality-show talent competitions. For every hour that our demands are not met, another top star dies.' 'Goodbye, Mr. Clooney,' Spiner added before unloading a single round from his silenced pistol into the Gravity star's face. According to witnesses, dozens of angry actors marched off the CW lot in Burbank yesterday and pillaged through the streets carrying the head of TV executive Les Moonves. Bands of the irate C-listers are said to have poured down from the Hollywood Hills at nightfall, reportedly smashing the limousines and luxury vehicles they encountered on Melrose Avenue and Rodeo Drive before laying siege to the Los Feliz compound of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt. A visibly stunned and blood-spattered maid working at the Pitt-Jolie residence told reporters she saw former Touched By An Angel actress Della Reese and an America's Next Top Model finalist bludgeon the star couple to death with their own Academy Award and Golden Globe statuettes. Others who managed to escape the violence shared similar stories of the wanton killing carried out by the crazed lower-tier television and film actors. 'Bodies were piling up all around me, and I just got under my desk and prayed,' said Weinstein Company executive assistant Marley LaFond, who described a number of cast members from The Goldbergs and Criminal Minds, whom she recognized but was unable to name, storming her Beverly Hills office, massacring employees, and forcing Harvey Weinstein to sign a contract with his own blood that guaranteed his attackers prominent film roles for the next decade. 'They tied me up and forced me to watch as they threw Mr. Weinstein out a window.' 'Then they put a gun up to my head and told me to tell the world what happened in there,' a trembling LaFond continued. In a disturbing display of the scope and gruesomeness of the uprising, a video was leaked online of Alicia Silverstone and Lance Bass commandeering a TMZ Celebrity Tour bus and crashing it through a fundraising gala at Leonardo DiCaprio's mansion. In the video, the pair are seen detonating explosives strapped to their chests, killing an unknown number of household names along with themselves. With such violence continuing unabated, many with connections to the C-list rioters have begun speaking out in hopes of bringing about an end to the celebrity mass murder. 'Please! I beg of you, stop this madness,' WME talent agent Ari Emanuel said in a public address this morning directed at the rebel group. 'We care about all our talent equally. Think about what you're doing to the American people when you spill the blood of their most-loved celebrities. You're not just harming the big-name movie stars; you're harming the audience. It's time for the slaughter to end.' 'You have our attention now,' Emanuel added.","entertainment, news, celebrities, death, violence, vol 52 issue 15, entertainment"

'Tragically, nine in 10 Americans will die having only heard the song's beguiling synthesizer intro accompanied by Mr. Winwood's silky-smooth yet slightly edged vocals for just the most minuscule fraction of their time on earth,' said professor Cindy Nancherla, lead author of the report, which also found that most people will unfortunately spend vastly larger portions of their life sleeping, working, stuck in traffic, and, most disturbingly, listening to Toto's 'Rosanna.' 'So much of the typical individual's lifespan is squandered not waiting for the upbeat drums to kick in during the chorus and not hearing that heart-stopping key change in the bridge. It's just so sad'you can never get those hours and days back.' Nancherla added that it was not too late for the majority of Americans to put on Winwood's 1986 kinetic pop-rock masterpiece Back In The High Life and completely turn their lives around.","entertainment, music, news in brief, vol 52 issue 13, entertainment"

737,Obama Receives Classified Briefing On Likelihood Of 'Krull' Reboot,"WASHINGTON'Shortly after arriving in the Oval Office early Thursday morning, President Obama reportedly met with key advisors to receive his daily classified briefing on the likelihood of a reboot of the 1983 science-fiction film Krull. The private meetings, which have been held at the start of each day since Obama assumed office in 2009, are said to bring together top intelligence officials to address the latest evidence for a forthcoming remake of the sword-and-sorcery cult classic and evaluate the possibility of a wide-scale theatrical release. According to reports, Thursday's meeting focused primarily on recent intel regarding likely funding sources for a hypothetical reboot, plausible casting scenarios, and rumors of an updated screenplay obtained from online sci-fi message boards. 'As soon as I finish my morning security meeting with the director of national intelligence, I consult with my Krull advisory team to get a better sense of where we stand on a potential remake,' said Obama, who was reportedly briefed today on unverified claims of a major release date timed for the 2019 holiday season. 'I believe we need to be prepared for any possible outcome, including everything from a shot-for-shot remake of the original story of a hero defending his planet from a humanoid invader known as the Beast, to the far more drastic possibility of a full-on reimagining of the Krull cinematic universe.' 'We've also assembled a detailed list of who might emerge to helm a possible remake in the wake of the death of the film's director, Peter Yates,' Obama continued. 'And we continue to monitor those individuals with utmost vigilance.' Obama, who first saw Krull in theaters in the summer of 1983, is said to spend as many as two hours each day poring over possible plans for cameos, reviewing classified satellite imagery of potential filming locations for the Iron Desert battle sequence, and considering the latest intelligence assessments of whether traditional effects or CGI would be employed to recreate the original's Crystal Spider character. The president has also instructed staff to interrupt him at any time, day or night, with high-priority Krull developments, according to White House sources. As recently as last week, Obama was reportedly roused at 2 a.m. to survey what was believed to be an intercepted concept rendering of the Glaive'an iconic five-pointed throwing blade telepathically controlled by protagonist Prince Colwyn'until forensic analysis revealed it to be merely a piece of fan art unassociated with a new production. 'When we first picked up online chatter in February that Freddie Jones may have been approached by a casting director to reprise his role as Ynyr, the Old One, I went immediately to pull the president from his meeting with Angela Merkel,' said David McKinley, one of several top-level analysts handpicked by Obama from the Central Intelligence Agency. 'We later determined it to be a false lead, but not before the president had us all convene in the Roosevelt Room for an emergency meeting to ascertain the last known whereabouts of every cast member still alive.' 'After an hour or so of heated discussion, I remember the president became deadly sober and went around the room one by one asking each of us our best-guess percentage on the prospect of Liam Neeson coming back as Kegan,' he added. 'That's as focused and intense as I've ever seen him.' Several West Wing sources confirmed that the commander-in-chief has, at times, acted on credible information related to the film. In 2012, Obama is said to have signed a top-secret executive order to extend the visa of Lysette Anthony, the British actress who played Princess Lyssa, on the off-chance a trip to the U.S. might include meetings with Krull screenwriter Stanford Sherman. Reports also suggest that the possibility of a reboot weighed heavily on Obama's mind while he brokered last year's Trans-Pacific Partnership, with the president repeatedly suggesting to aides that Asia could be an extremely receptive market for Krull's unique, genre-defying blend of science fiction and high fantasy. 'What you have to understand is that the president believes the Krull world has franchise potential that could conceivably stretch on for years if handled correctly,' said White House aide Alison Furman. 'I think he sees ensuring that the next generation of moviegoers gets to watch Ergo the Magnificent and his band of thieves triumphantly ride their Fire Mares into battle against the Slayers as potentially the defining accomplishment of his presidency.'","entertainment, movies, barack obama, news, vol 52 issue 10, entertainment"

739,Noam Chomsky Announces Las Vegas Residency,"Political Critic To Make Nightly Speaking Appearances At Bellagio Resort Through 2019 LAS VEGAS'During a standing-room-only press event at the Bellagio hotel Thursday, renowned linguist, political commentator, and anarcho-syndicalist advocate Noam Chomsky announced an upcoming three-year residency at the luxury resort and casino that is scheduled to begin this April. According to sources, Chomsky will take over a brand-new 5,000-seat venue built specially for the production, which will run six nights a week, with a matinee on Saturday. The two-hour speaking engagement and acrobatics extravaganza, titled Noam Chomsky's Hegemony Of Wonder, will reportedly span the highlights of the MIT professor emeritus's 60-plus'year career as a social justice activist and outspoken critic of American foreign policy. 'This mesmerizing spectacle is the culmination of everything I've worked toward in my life,' said the 87-year-old Chomsky, bedecked in one of the sequined cardigans he will wear during the nightly appearances, which will reportedly feature nine total costume changes. 'Audiences can expect a dazzling laser-light-show lecture on the theory of generative grammar, followed by a rollicking cabaret-style reenactment of my rancorous back-and-forth with Christopher Hitchens in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, plus a medley of my other hits from the '60s through today'not to mention a few heart-stopping, edge-of-your-seat surprises along the way!' 'And each night, I'll bring one special audience member up on stage to debate me over the illegitimacy of unjustified authority,' Chomsky continued. 'Could it be you?' While Chomsky stated that he wrote and designed most of the production himself, he confirmed he had brought on others to assist in its development, working closely with choreographers from Cirque du Soleil's Zumanity and Slovenian philosopher and Marxist intellectual Slavoj Žižek. Bellagio spokespeople teased the performance by offering a few details about the first act, noting that a harnessed Chomsky would be kicking off the show by sweeping dramatically over the crowd riding a radiant LED-covered lectern emblazoned with his large, gleaming initials. Officials noted the opening sequence would be followed by a dramatic 'aqua fantasy experience' exploring humans' inborn language acquisition device, before segueing into a 45-minute reading of key passages from Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy Of The Mass Media. 'Whether you're a diehard Chomsky fan or new to his libertarian socialist ideology, there will be something in this show for absolutely everyone,' said Bellagio events coordinator Rachel O'Brien. 'And be on the lookout for Orwell, Mr. Chomsky's albino peacock co-star!' According to the resort's website, the show is already completely sold out for the next several months, with some tickets being listed through intermediary vendors for many times their face value. 'I'm so excited'I've been into Chomsky since college,' said 49-year-old Boise, ID social worker Karen Wenning, who is planning a trip to Las Vegas next month to see the social critic's lavish new production. 'It'll be incredible to hear him denounce transnational corporate power live and in person. I just really hope he does some of his early stuff from American Power And The New Mandarins and Counter-Revolutionary Violence: Bloodbaths In Fact And Propaganda. That stuff is classic.' At press time, Bellagio representatives said the premiere had been pushed back two weeks after Chomsky was injured rehearsing a sequence in which he performs an aerial silk routine while demonstrating how formal syntax can explain the ability of people to produce and interpret an infinite number of novel utterances within a finite set of rules and terms.","entertainment, news, noam chomsky, vol 52 issue 09, entertainment"

'The Doggy is a gripping tale of a playful 3-year-old yellow Labrador retriever in the Yukon and shows London, the master of vivid naturalist prose, at the height of his literary powers,' said Columbia University professor Andrew Spellman of the longhand manuscript that is believed to have been penned in 1908 and chronicles the everyday life of a dog named Cody as he gnaws on fur-lined boots, scampers after tennis balls, and gives big, wet, sloppy kisses. 'Indeed, one cannot read The Doggy without feeling the author's intensity for the subject, from the untamed ferocity of Cody's howls when he hears the doorbell ring, to the raw yearning seen in the doggy's eyes when he wants his big old tummy rubbed.' According to Spellman, this is the most significant discovery in American literature since a copy of Robert Frost's unpublished poem 'Brrrrrr, It's Cold' turned up in 2003.","entertainment, history, culture, books, news in brief, vol 52 issue 06, entertainment"

'I yelled really loud in this movie when I was angry and I started crying hard after I got upset, so hopefully the guys who choose the winners saw all that and liked it,' said DiCaprio, who expressed optimism that his chances will be further bolstered by the fact that, in addition to stumbling and falling a bunch of times in the snow, there were some scenes where he shouted so loud it made his throat hurt, and sometimes spittle even came out of his mouth and got trapped in the big, gross beard he grew. 'I bet my chances are good because this is the most I've ever screamed and cried'way more than I did in Revolutionary Road or Gangs Of New York. Plus my nose was dripping a lot but I didn't even wipe it; I just left it there.' DiCaprio then admitted that he is still somewhat nervous that he did a bad job during the parts where he sits quietly and looks at something far away.","entertainment, celebrities, oscars, leonardo dicaprio, movies, news in brief, vol 52 issue 01, entertainment"

757,Women In Hollywood Perfectly Okay They Not Represented Behind The Scenes Of 'The Blacklist',"LOS ANGELES'While acknowledging concerns that men vastly outnumber women in key creative positions in Hollywood, a coalition of female writers, producers, and directors told reporters Wednesday they have 'absolutely no problem at all' being underrepresented behind the scenes of NBC's The Blacklist. 'It is high time that women made significant strides forward in film and television, but that said, we're totally fine not making any of those strides on a show where James Spader regularly wears a fedora and is supposed to be the world's greatest criminal mastermind,' said coalition spokeswoman Gina Erickson, adding that the ongoing movement for equality in the industry could still make progress even if men wrote most of the dialogue spoken by actresses in a drama that rests on the concept that Spader has compiled a list of the world's most dangerous criminals and demands to lead FBI efforts to catch them. 'If the unique perspectives of women in modern society aren't fully articulated on a dramatic TV series in which the lead female character is an FBI profiler who fails to realize her own husband is a secret assassin, that is, in all honestly, completely acceptable to us.' The coalition later issued a broader statement indicating that, upon further review, they would in fact be okay with not being represented behind the scenes of NBC's entire current programming lineup.","entertainment, women, television, gender, news in brief, vol 52 issue 00, entertainment"
758,Man Who Saw 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' 6 Times Over Holidays Thought It Was Pretty Good,"CHICAGO'Stressing that the movie 'definitely had some cool moments,' local man Jeff Feitel, who saw Star Wars: The Force Awakens six times over the holidays, told reporters Monday that he thought it was pretty good. 'I had a few issues with some stuff, but overall I thought it was a fun movie,' said Feitel, who over the past two weeks has cumulatively spent 14 hours and $87 attending screenings of the film, including multiple 3D viewings, a midnight showing, and an IMAX screening at 8:50 a.m. 'I honestly thought the lightsaber battles were just so-so, but the reliance on practical effects was kind of awesome. And it lays out a pretty compelling mythology for the next couple movies, too.'At press time, Feitel was reportedly purchasing a ticket to see The Force Awakens again that evening.","entertainment, star wars, movies, news in brief, vol 52 issue 00, entertainment"
759,Guy Wearing Chewbacca Costume Torn Between Seeing 'Star Wars' And 'The Big Short',"BOSTON'Going back and forth between the two options as he approached the movie theater ticket counter, a man dressed in a full Chewbacca costume told reporters Thursday that he was torn between seeing Star Wars: The Force Awakens and the new financial film The Big Short. 'I've been waiting for the new Star Wars movie to come out for a while, but then again, Brad Pitt's supposed to be really good in this, and it could be cool to see [director] Adam McKay do a drama'jeez, I don't know,' he said, adjusting his Wookiee mask and admitting that he just wasn't sure whether he was more in the mood for an epic adventure film or an ensemble drama. 'It'd be kind of interesting to hear the story behind the housing market collapse, but on the other hand, I've been camped out to see The Force Awakens for the past eight days. Actually, now that I'm looking at it, In The Heart Of The Sea sounds pretty good, too. Man, this is tough.' At press time, the man had removed the gloves of his Chewbacca costume to look up the Rotten Tomatoes score of each film on his phone.","entertainment, star wars, movies, news in brief, vol 51 issue 50, entertainment"

761,Fan Just Going To Keep Open Mind About Whether New 'Star Wars' Best Or Worst Movie Ever,"CHICAGO'In an effort to avoid making a judgment before he even enters the theater, local fan Mike Siedler confirmed Wednesday that he was going into tomorrow's premiere with an open mind about whether Star Wars: The Force Awakens is the best or worst movie ever made. 'It's easy to jump to conclusions over such a highly anticipated movie, but I'm trying to be impartial about whether it's the greatest thing I've ever seen or a colossal disappointment that will forever taint my treasured childhood memories,' said Siedler, adding that he would do his best to hold off on deciding if the film deserves to be immediately hailed as an all-time cinema classic alongside A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back, or railed against as a crass commercial cash-in that makes the prequels look good in comparison. 'I grew up on these movies, so I'm obviously bringing a lot of expectations, but I'll try to be unbiased before determining if the new characters and storylines are an exciting direction for the series or a complete betrayal of everything Star Wars should be. Ultimately, if I can keep some perspective on whether J.J. Abrams is a genius who restored the magic and wonder of the Star Wars franchise or a talentless hack who shouldn't be allowed anywhere near a film set, I'll enjoy the movie more.' Siedler further added that he would refrain from deciding whether to spend half or all of his paycheck on The Force Awakens merchandise until after the film.","entertainment, star wars, movies, news in brief, vol 51 issue 50, entertainment"

766,Nation Demands More Movies Where Guy Reveals He Was Wearing Bulletproof Vest,"LOS ANGELES'Concerned moviegoing citizens across the nation issued an urgent appeal to Hollywood studios this week to make more films in which a guy is shot multiple times in the chest and then, later on, is revealed to have been wearing a bulletproof vest the whole time. 'There need to be a lot more movies where the main guy gets shot a bunch and we think he's dead, but after a little while he gets back up because he's actually still alive,' said Little Rock, AR resident Sarah Greene, echoing the sentiments of millions of Americans as she further stipulated that the individual must at some point rip open his shirt to show the audience the vest and the flattened bullets embedded within it. 'And the movies better show somebody holding the guy's head in their lap and crying because they think he's been killed. Or they should have a part where, after the guy's been shot, he lifts his gun up out of nowhere and shoots the guy who shot him'right before that guy is about to shoot someone else.' The nation's movie viewers also demanded more ending scenes in which the action subsides for a moment before a good guy shoots a bad guy we thought was already dead even though he really wasn't.","entertainment, movies, news in brief, vol 51 issue 47, entertainment"
767,Brad Pitt Scampers Away From Script After Detecting Musk Of Chris Pine On Pages,"LOS ANGELES'Hollywood leading man Brad Pitt hissed and skittered away into the safety of the woods surrounding his house Friday after reading a screenplay from his agent and detecting the musk of fellow actor Chris Pine on its pages, numerous sources reported. Witnesses confirmed that upon receiving the 158-page draft of a Civil War drama during a meeting at his home, Pitt began furiously sniffing up and down the binding and back cover in search of any scent markings, eventually detecting Pine's pheromones while flipping through the second scene. After his eyes widened and his ears pricked back, the 51-year-old actor reportedly bolted away from the script, exiting through a back door at full speed and disappearing into the underbrush. Those present said that after an exhaustive search, an assistant with a flashlight found the whimpering Golden Globe winner hiding under a neighbor's porch, covered in dirt and shrinking back from anyone who attempted to approach him. At press time, Pitt's agent was seen frantically attempting to coax the actor out with an option contract for a Chuck Palahniuk novel, only to be urinated on in response.","brad pitt, entertainment, celebrities, movies, news in brief, vol 51 issue 46, entertainment"

770,Robert De Niro Stunned To Learn Of Man Who Can Quote 'Goodfellas',"Bring Him To Me,' Actor Demands NEW YORK'Immediately halting production on his latest project after hearing of the incredible talent, legendary actor Robert De Niro was reportedly stunned to learn Wednesday that Bayonne, NJ resident Eric Sullivan, 33, can quote the critically acclaimed 1990 Martin Scorsese film Goodfellas at length. Witnesses confirmed that De Niro, who played gangster Jimmy Conway in the movie, refused to continue with the filming of HBO's upcoming Bernie Madoff biopic, The Wizard Of Lies, until the gifted man could be brought before the actor to demonstrate his singular ability to repeat sections of dialogue from the Academy Award'winning crime drama. 'Whoa, whoa, whoa'you're saying this guy can recite 15 or 20 lines from the movie, fully and completely, without messing up or having to stop even once?' said De Niro after rushing over to a crew member who he had overheard telling several coworkers about Sullivan's skill. 'He can just reel off the dialogue, word for word? From all the biggest scenes?' 'Find him now'do whatever you gotta do to get him here, ASAP,' De Niro added after calling over his assistant and whispering urgently in her ear. After learning that the man had been known to recite lines along with the film while it played, as well as repeat entire monologues when hanging out with his buddies at a bar, De Niro was reportedly further shocked to find out that Sullivan was also able to call on his ability in a casual workplace setting, with his family during holiday visits, and, on rare occasion, while ordering fast food at a drive-thru window'all without the aid of a script. De Niro, who discovered that Sullivan was not a famous entertainer but instead an unmarried sales associate at a Jersey City'area Verizon Wireless location, was said to be so astonished that he was rendered incapable of speech for several minutes. 'So you're saying I could deliver a line from the scene where Billy starts busting Tommy's balls and he could deliver the exact response, just like that?' De Niro said after regaining his composure. 'And he does the accents and even gets all the pauses and hand gestures right? How have I never heard of this guy before?' De Niro then reportedly made a phone call to the assistant he had just dispatched to find Sullivan, telling her to reserve the penthouse suite at the Plaza Hotel for the incredible man and saying that he would meet Sullivan there shortly. 'Actually, on second thought, don't put him in a hotel'take him to my place in Tribeca,' the two-time Oscar winner said. 'I want him to stay with me for a while. And don't take no for an answer.' Before placing several more phone calls to Goodfellas co-stars Ray Liotta, Lorraine Bracco, and Joe Pesci about the man's prowess, De Niro reportedly speculated that he and Sullivan might immediately become good friends. The actor is said to have given considerable thought to this possibility, especially after learning that Sullivan knew several pieces of miscellaneous production trivia about the film, including the fact that Martin Scorsese's actual mother had played Pesci's character's mother, that Nora Ephron's comedic Steve Martin vehicle My Blue Heaven was based on the same story as Goodfellas, and that Ray Liotta would listen to FBI wiretap recordings of the real Henry Hill to help get into character. 'People must constantly be bothering him to do the 'You think I'm funny?' scene in the bar'I know I'd never get tired of hearing it,' De Niro said. 'I honestly can't believe he even does a dead-on Paul Sorvino impression'I've tried, and it's impossible. And how can he do that at the same time he's remembering all the lines?' Sources said De Niro then deliberated for several minutes, wondering whether he should immediately head to Sullivan's home to see the man in his element and witness the incredible feat in person. At press time, De Niro was reportedly outraged to learn that Sullivan was en route to Newark Liberty International Airport at the behest of comedy legend Mel Brooks, who insisted that Sullivan immediately fly to Los Angeles after Brooks learned that he could recite the entirety of the 1987 Star Wars spoof Spaceballs.","entertainment, celebrities, movies, news, vol 51 issue 45, entertainment"

778,MPAA Adds New Rating To Warn Audiences Of Films Not Based On Existing Works,"WASHINGTON'In an effort to provide moviegoers with the information they need to determine which films are appropriate for them to see, the Motion Picture Association of America announced Tuesday the addition of a new rating to alert audiences of movies that are not based on existing works. According to MPAA officials, the new 'O,' or 'Original,' designation will inform viewers that a particular film contains characters with whom they are unfamiliar, previously unseen settings, and novel plots. The rating will also reportedly serve as a warning of the potentially disorienting effects associated with having to remember characters' names for as many as two hours and the discomfort that can occur when one is forced to keep track of narrative arcs for an entire film. 'It's simply a value-neutral designation intended to protect consumers, ensuring that they are fully informed about a movie and are able to make their own decisions about how much artistic and narrative originality they are comfortable seeing.' 'We recognize how distressing it can be when viewers go into a film and suddenly find themselves confronted with jarring scenes containing a protagonist they've never encountered before, which is precisely why we created this rating,' said Joan Graves, head of the MPAA's ratings board, who said the new category was added in part due to the thousands of complaints the organization has received from moviegoers who were upset they weren't given advance notice that they'd have to make sense of the scenarios unfolding onscreen. 'It's important that today's movie fans are aware upon entering the theater that none of what they will see has been adapted from a well-known comic book, television series, novel, video game, historical event, previous movie, or theme park ride.' 'Ultimately, it will be up to the consumer's discretion as to whether a film is suitable for themselves and their family, but the O rating will explicitly caution people that they will have to pay attention during the movie and follow the storyline on their own,' Graves added. Though sources said films requiring the new rating are comparatively rare, a spate of high-profile movies over the past several years that do not stem from any previously existing source material'including The Kids Are All Right, Her, WALL-E, Birdman, and Nebraska, among others'have left many viewers angered and perplexed. Citing test audiences they have observed, MPAA officials said that many moviegoers spent the entirety of such films in a state of distress, waiting for the moment when the Incredible Hulk, Katniss Everdeen, Wolverine, or another recognizable character from an established franchise would appear onscreen and clarify the meaning and direction of the film. 'I never would have gone to see Sicario if I knew it was going to be so unbearable,' said filmgoer Mark Kemmer of Cleveland, referring to the recently released crime thriller set against the violent backdrop of the contemporary Mexican drug trade that, under the MPAA's guidelines, would receive the new rating. 'It was pretty much unwatchable. It seemed like in nearly every scene I had to figure out who the people were and where the story was going. And the whole movie was like that!' 'What a waste of money,' he added. Others reported being viscerally repulsed by movies they attended that were not based on media that originated several decades or generations earlier, saying they had become so upset by what they had seen that they had trouble even sitting through the films. 'How does this trash even get made?' said Katherine Hubbard, a mother of three from Rockford, IL, who, after buying tickets for the Pixar film Inside Out, was incensed that her children had been exposed to original storytelling. 'Within the first minute, some little girl character my kids have never seen or heard of walks onscreen, and then we immediately have to learn her whole backstory and how she navigates the world? I marched us all right out of that theater after about 10 minutes.' While audiences have reportedly been receptive to the new rating, directors and distributors have already decried it as severely damaging in regard to box-office revenues and the number of venues that will carry their films. However, the MPAA was adamant that the new classification should not be interpreted as censorship. 'The O rating isn't meant to be a punishment or a moral judgment of any kind,' Graves said. 'It's simply a value-neutral designation intended to protect consumers, ensuring that they are fully informed about a movie and are able to make their own decisions about how much artistic and narrative originality they are comfortable seeing.' 'If filmmakers want to avoid the rating and appeal to a wider audience, all they have to do is throw in a superhero or a hobbit or some other licensed property,' Graves added.","entertainment, movies, news, vol 51 issue 42, entertainment"

783,Netflix To Temporarily Remove Every Movie Except 'Hard Eight',"Everyone Should See It At Least Once,' Company Says LOS GATOS, CA'Saying that everyone, including all 65 million of its subscribers, really ought to see the film at least once, Netflix announced Tuesday that it will suspend all streaming content except Hard Eight for a full month. Officials from the online video subscription service, which boasts a library of tens of thousands of movies and TV shows in addition to the first feature film by acclaimed writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson, told reporters they will temporarily remove all other titles from the website and devote 100 percent of their server capacity to the 1996 neo-noir drama. 'We want to make sure every one of our members watches this thrilling character study of a veteran gambler and his young protégé, so for the entire month of October, Hard Eight will be the only video available on the entire site,' said chief content officer Ted Sarandos, who, upon discovering only a fraction of subscribers had ever seen the understated masterpiece starring Philip Baker Hall and John C. Reilly, immediately called a meeting of the Netflix board of directors and urged them to approve such a plan. 'It's an incredible, one-of-a-kind film, and a directorial debut no less. Not surprisingly, all four of its main actors went on to have huge careers. We can't in good conscience stream any other piece of entertainment until all subscribers have viewed it.' 'Honestly, it's worth seeing for Philip Seymour Hoffman's career-launching cameo alone,' Sarandos added. Company representatives explained that, for the next 30 days, visitors to the Netflix website will be greeted by a large static image of the movie's poster, below which will appear dozens of identical Hard Eight icons that can be scrolled through and clicked upon in order to view the film. According to sources, every slot in every customer's queue will be replaced with Hard Eight, and subscribers will periodically receive recommendation emails in which only Hard Eight will be suggested. The provisional changes will also extend to the company's DVD mail-order service, officials stated, with Netflix having already substituted every currently requested movie with one of several million recently purchased copies of Hard Eight. Netflix representatives emphasized that the movie will remain customers' only option for the entire month, regardless of whether they choose to watch it on day one or if they have previously seen Hard Eight months or years before, with officials noting that the complex, multilayered film is 'worth watching several times.' 'We're pleased to announce that, throughout October, our subscribers will be able to watch Hard Eight as much as they like'anytime, on any device, anywhere,' said Netflix co-founder and CEO Reed Hastings, who added that he's seen the opening sequence in which Sydney shows John the ropes of casino gambling 'probably a hundred times' and he always finds something new in it to admire. 'Best of all, once you've gotten to the end and the credits start rolling, Netflix will suggest you watch it again, and Hard Eight will automatically replay after 15 seconds.' 'I don't want to give anything away, but the great scene where John and Clementine get themselves into that hostage mess, and then Sydney swoops in and just cleans everything up'that scene on its own requires at least two or three viewings to appreciate fully,' he continued. Hastings went on to state that once the month is over, the film will be removed and replaced exclusively with Rounders, which may not be quite as impressive as Hard Eight, but is still a film you should really check out.","entertainment, business, movies, news, vol 51 issue 39, netflix, entertainment"

785,Screen Actors Guild Develops Retraining Program For 30-Year-Old Actresses Aging Out Of Workforce,"LOS ANGELES'In an effort to help open new doors for the many women struggling to readjust to life after performing, officials from the Screen Actors Guild'American Federation of Television and Radio Artists spoke to reporters Thursday about the union's new job-training program for 30-year-old actresses who have aged out of the workforce. SAG-AFTRA officials, who said the vast majority of female performers are not prepared for the hardships of losing acting work at the end of their 20s, described the wide variety of tools the new program utilizes'ranging from instructional seminars, to networking events, to hands-on workshops'to help transition women into positions in film production, distribution, and financing. 'As actresses enter their 30s, they suddenly find themselves without a job and nowhere to turn; we want to ensure that they have the skills to find meaningful employment elsewhere in the industry,' said SAG-AFTRA president Ken Howard, who added that through the retraining program, nearly 85 percent of unemployed actresses are able to secure jobs in behind-the-scenes fields within 18 months. 'Too often, these performers are cast aside after their on-screen usefulness has run its course, and they fall through the cracks. We're here to help them get back on their feet.' 'Many of these women have dedicated themselves to their craft for up to a decade, and it's our turn to pay them back,' Howard continued. According to the program's website, women who enroll are entitled to free instructional classes'which meet in the basement of the union's headquarters'geared toward teaching the basics of production jobs such as sound mixing, organizing receipts for on-set expenses, wardrobe supervision, and properly handling pyrotechnics. Former actresses can also attend résumé workshops where career coaches will assist them in showcasing any relevant job experience they may have had prior to their careers in acting, such as highlighting previous restaurant work to help them land a position in craft services. The placement program reportedly also provides the women with experiential training, including apprenticeships that pair former A-list stars with professionals in a field of interest such as prop masters or the actresses' own former personal assistants. Highlighting the success of the program, administrators noted that Oscar winner Michelle Williams, who spent four months shadowing a line producer at Universal Studios, is now working there full-time as a location scout. SAG-AFTRA officials told reporters they are currently developing a web portal that will include job listings from production companies looking to hire female performers who are now beyond on-camera working age. 'It can certainly come as a shock to many of these women when they realize they are losing jobs to a younger generation of workers,' said Howard, noting that many struggling older actresses often overestimate their ability to secure the extremely limited number of Hollywood's divorcee, witch, and unstable or overbearing mother roles. 'We try to explain to them that if they want to stay in the industry, they'll need to show employers that they have something to offer beyond compelling performances.' 'The sooner they accept that and take action, the sooner they'll be back in show business,' he continued. Howard added that the union also offers services intended to preempt women from becoming unemployed in the first place, citing counseling sessions for performers in their mid-20s designed to help them map out a path to careers in marketing or accounting in order to make the jump as seamless as possible. 'After I stopped getting roles, I felt very lost and afraid; this was the job I'd spent my whole life training for, and it was all I'd ever really known,' said former actress Maggie Gyllenhaal, 37, who explained that, with the help of the program, she has found steady work as a best boy electric on Hollywood films and was recently hired as the gaffer on the upcoming movie Jack Reacher 2. 'The workshops and coaching sessions gave me the confidence and skills to begin a new chapter in my career, and I'm extremely thankful for that.' 'I'm glad my daughter can see that even though her mother is no longer able to get work on the screen, she can still contribute in her own small way,' she added.","entertainment, movies, women, gender, news, vol 51 issue 38, entertainment"

787,Study Finds Movie Attendance Declining As More Americans Act Out Films At Home,"LOS ANGELES'Noting that ticket sales nationwide have fallen to a 20-year low, a study published Friday by the Motion Picture Association of America found that movie theater attendance continues to decline as more Americans choose to act out films at home. According to the study, rising ticket prices across the country, combined with the greater convenience of staying in, have contributed to the popularity of performing full-length feature films in the comfort of individuals' own living rooms. 'Whereas previous generations of moviegoers would look forward to new movie releases and head to their local theater on a Friday or Saturday night, today's entertainment consumers are increasingly choosing to print out screenplays, cast friends and family in the various roles, and act out films without ever leaving their houses or apartments,' said MPAA analyst Tate Mitchell, citing the fact that in 2015, more than 80 million households acted out summer blockbusters on their opening weekends, including Jurassic World and Mission: Impossible'Rogue Nation, rather than viewing them on the big screen, a 14 percent increase over the previous year. 'Savings aside, this option also provides people with a much greater variety of movies to act out, from the latest big-budget action-adventure films, dramas, and romantic comedies to Hollywood classics, documentaries, and foreign films.' 'When people are faced with choosing one of a limited number of fixed showtimes, driving to and from the theater, and finding seats together among scores of strangers, it's easy to see why staying home and performing a film or even two makes more sense,' he continued. In a survey conducted by entertainment industry analytics firm Rentrak, moviegoers cited cost as the main reason for avoiding the theater, noting that the price for a family of four attending the Pixar hit Inside Out in theaters could reach $50, compared with the $12.95 it would cost to run off four copies of the script at a nearby print and copy center. Taking 20 children to the same movie for a birthday party would cost as much as $200, excluding soda and snacks, compared to the much lower cost of letting the children act it out in a parent's basement or rec room. Additionally, 72 percent of respondents said they enjoyed the flexibility of home-acting versus watching movies in the theater, noting that if one of them needed to use the restroom or get more popcorn during a pivotal scene, the actors could pause the performance and do another take when the person got back. Nearly two-thirds of those polled also cited a lack of advertisements before performances as a benefit, as moviegoers were able to jump right into the film without performing any trailers, or only act out the trailers they were most excited about. 'The first Avengers film made billions of dollars worldwide, but when the sequel came out, people said, 'You know what, instead of waiting in line for this, let's just act it out at home or go over to the neighbors' and see them perform it.'' Parents in particular said they enjoyed knowing that, unlike seeing a new movie in theaters, performing films at home allowed them to make edits and script notes to protect their children from gratuitously violent or sexual material. 'Last weekend, the whole family decided to act out The Master, so my husband and I made sure to remove all the inappropriate stuff from the script before we started,' said 38-year-old Cincinnati-area mother Janice Dewins, who played the roles of Lancaster Dodd's wife, Peggy, the salesgirl Martha, and several other supporting characters. 'My 8-year-old son was Freddie Quell, who gets hooked on a mix of alcohol and gasoline, but we just had him drink orange juice instead. It was nice to be able to stop the performance at any time to explain to him what was going on or to comfort him whenever anything he was acting out got too scary.' 'We obviously cut that whole explicit scene where Peggy pleasures Lancaster in the bathroom,' Dewins added. Other moviegoers went on to say they particularly appreciated being able to prepare their own concessions at home instead of paying exorbitant theater prices. Rather than shell out $12 to $14 for a bucket of popcorn, many families said they make their own in the microwave, while others explained how they pour three cans of soda into a large cup to create their own 36-ounce beverage. Many industry insiders have taken notice of the trend, and admitted that as Americans put on millions of productions of movies every year'performances that are becoming much more nuanced, layered, and compelling as consumers hone their craft 'the traditional model of film distribution may soon become entirely obsolete. 'The first Avengers film made billions of dollars worldwide, but when the sequel came out, people said, 'You know what, instead of waiting in line for this, let's just act it out at home or go over to the neighbors' and see them perform it,'' said Walt Disney Studios spokesperson Eric Rudolph, who admitted that he and his wife recently decided not to see Straight Outta Compton in theaters, with both agreeing they would just wait until the script showed up on the internet and then act it out at a later date. 'The fact of the matter is, the industry is going to have to pivot to accommodate the new reality of people who just want to wind down after a long day by going into their room, shutting the door, and acting out a film alone'particularly if other family members or roommates are acting out another movie in the living area.' Rudolph added that the advent of smartphones has also drastically changed filmgoers' habits, as it is now easier than ever for people to load scripts onto their devices, act out 15 minutes of a movie on their commute to work, and pick it back up at the next scene on their way home.","entertainment, movies, money, news, vol 51 issue 37, entertainment"

'It is nothing short of a tragedy to see extremists callously rob the world of this priceless piece of Fab Four memorabilia,' said historian James Hanson of Yale University, noting that this particular 500/1 violin bass, which can be seen in an ISIS propaganda video being smashed to pieces by black-clad fighters who then pose with the shattered fretboard and offer their praise to God, was one of just two instruments used by the iconic musician during the Beatles' 1965 European Tour, and the only one to feature his signature. 'This treasured artifact was a tangible connection to the band's brilliant performances of 'I Feel Fine,' 'A Hard Day's Night,' and other chart-topping hits that delighted audiences during the very height of Beatlemania. This is not just a loss for fans of Sir Paul or music lovers, but a loss for humanity as a whole. If this one-of-a-kind piece of rock history isn't sacred, what is?' Hanson added that, despite their latest efforts, the terrorists will never succeed in extinguishing humanity's appreciation of the British Invasion.","entertainment, music, terrorism, isis, the beatles, paul mccartney, news in brief, vol 51 issue 34, entertainment"

798,Humanity Still Producing New Art As Though Megadeth's 'Rust In Peace' Doesn't Already Exist,"WASHINGTON'Saying that any further endeavors of technical skill and imagination were pointless, experts at the Smithsonian Institution reportedly questioned Monday why new art was still being produced after the pinnacle of aesthetic and creative potential was reached in 1990 with Megadeth's fourth studio album, Rust In Peace. 'As the unquestioned apex of the entire history of the creative arts, Rust In Peace is the finest and last necessary piece of human expression'but it's almost as though current so-called artists are completely oblivious to Dave Mustaine's blistering, transcendent guitar work on 'Hangar 18,'' said Smithsonian curator of contemporary art Joanna Marsh, gesturing dismissively in the direction of a massive self-portrait by photorealist Chuck Close, completed in 2000. 'It's not just incredibly disrespectful to keep making art; in many ways, it's actually quite sad. The deluded people churning out this worthless garbage just can't seem to reconcile themselves to the fact that their pathetic little sculptures and films and novels and whatnot will always pale in comparison to the brilliantly inspired, heart-stopping tempo shift halfway through 'Holy WarsEE The Punishment Due.'' At press time, a spokesperson from the Centre Pompidou in Paris confirmed the museum's plans to throw out the contents of an entire wing and leave a massive, pure white space where the track 'Lucretia' will be played on loop at full volume.","entertainment, music, art, news in brief, vol 51 issue 31, entertainment"

800,Fan Has List Of Dream Marketers He'd Love To See Handle Next Spider-Man Film,"ROSWELL, GA'Expressing his desire for a high-caliber talent with the creative vision to do justice to the film's promotion, local man Jeff Crews told reporters Friday he has a list of dream marketers he'd love to see handle the next Spider-Man movie. 'I'd see anything with James H. Martin; he's an absolutely perfect choice for helming promotional events and the Spider-Man'McDonald's tie-in,' said Crews, who offered the names of several highly acclaimed marketers who he believes have the imagination and brilliance necessary to breathe life into the superhero franchise's branding. 'This is purely a fantasy, but Christopher Sanford would do such an amazing job with the film's social media strategy. And I'd be equally excited about a young gun like Stephen Edwards who has such innovative ideas'plus, you know he'll come up with some crazy twists and turns in the Spider-Man advertising campaign.

804,Leonardo DiCaprio Agrees To Donate It-Factor To Science,"LOS ANGELES'Saying the gift would immeasurably improve their understanding of the ineffable quality that makes certain big-screen stars positively radiate, researchers at the University of California Los Angeles announced Tuesday that A-list actor Leonardo DiCaprio has agreed to donate his it-factor to science. Sources said the 40-year-old actor, known for his roles in such critically and commercially successful films as The Wolf Of Wall Street and Titanic, granted the team of experts at UCLA permission to remove and preserve his je ne sais quoi for study upon his death. According to the scientists, DiCaprio's unprecedented donation will offer them new insights into the poorly understood phenomenon of real star power. 'Being able to conduct an in-depth examination of an it-factor of this magnitude will be an incredible boon to our field,' said lead researcher Dr. Stanley Udall, who for the past 30 years has investigated the complexities that differentiate stars from superstars. 'A proven box-office draw like this comes along once, maybe twice in a generation, and to be given unfettered access to study his certain something is beyond our wildest dreams.' 'There appears to be some as-yet unknown underlying system that perfectly balances these various facets in such a way that makes it impossible to take one's eyes off him from the second he comes into frame, even when he shares the screen with other handsome heartthrobs.' 'Through careful analysis, we may finally be able to precisely quantify how much women want him and men want to be him,' Udall added. Once scientists remove DiCaprio's it-factor, Udall said his team will isolate and closely inspect its base components to determine exactly how these parts work in concert to produce the indescribable, captivating quality that enables the actor to elevate even middling material, such as his role in The Great Gatsby, to the transcendent. 'In very basic terms, we believe Mr. DiCaprio's it-factor is composed of several constituent elements: his effortless charm, his rakish mischievousness, and his quiet, understated confidence,' said Udall, who confirmed that while researchers are still not 100 percent certain what it is, they know DiCaprio has it. 'However, there appears to be some as-yet unknown underlying system that perfectly balances these various facets in such a way that makes it impossible to take one's eyes off him from the second he comes into frame, even when he shares the screen with other handsome heartthrobs.' In addition to unraveling the exact mechanisms by which DiCaprio is able to steal every scene in which he appears, the scientists are optimistic they will discover the reason why certain stars' it-factors'such as DiCaprio's and George Clooney's'only strengthen with age, while others', such as Giovanni Ribisi's, atrophy very early on in their careers. Though the UCLA program has reportedly received similar donation pledges from actors with comparatively minuscule allure, including Josh Brolin and Casey Affleck, DiCaprio is by far the biggest name to contribute his it-factor. However, while DiCaprio's gift will vastly increase scientific knowledge in regard to the phenomenon, Udall said the most invaluable data will be gathered when the star's it-factor is compared to those of his contemporaries who lack that extra special something. 'Soon, we'll be able to understand what gives Leo his live-wire intensity in contexts where others fall just short,' Udall said. 'Why, for example, does he so easily command the limelight on-screen and off when Ryan Reynolds'who seems to have it all'leaves us cold? How does he consistently outshine the Fassbenders, the Hartnetts, and the Eckharts of the world on the red carpet? These are the questions that science has for years tried and failed to provide an answer to.' Udall went on to explain that once DiCaprio's it-factor has been studied and fully cataloged, the next step will be to synthetically recreate the quality in younger, less charismatic actors, potentially creating an entire generation of male leads who each possess a commanding silver-screen magnetism. However, he cautioned that such a breakthrough would require many more decades of research. 'I'm reluctant to promise miracles, but if analyzing Mr. DiCaprio's it-factor allows us to make the leaps forward that we hope it will, we may one day be able to catapult someone as blah and humdrum as Robert Pattinson to undeniable leading-man status,' Udall said.","entertainment, leonardo dicaprio, celebrities, news, vol 51 issue 29, entertainment"
805,"Harper Lee Announces Third Novel, 'My Excellent Caretaker Deserves My Entire Fortune'","NEW YORK'Shocking the literary world once again, acclaimed author Harper Lee announced through her publisher Tuesday the surprise release of her third novel, My Excellent Caretaker Deserves My Entire Fortune. 'On behalf of Ms. Lee, we're delighted to bring the public this moving new story, which follows the heartwarming relationship between a deaf and nearly blind author in the small-town South and the extremely kind and attentive caretaker to whom she wills every penny of her $45 million estate,' said HarperCollins president Michael Morrison, adding that the 185-page tale vividly brings to life the setting of a present-day assisted living facility in Monroeville, AL, where an 89-year-old protagonist named Harper comes to the life-changing decision to hand over all the money in her bank account, her property, and all future proceeds from the books she has published to her extremely upstanding and unselfish friend and lawyer, Tonja. 'This is a triumphant and uplifting tale of dedicated, exemplary caregiving and the substantial monetary bequest it inspires, told by one of America's greatest living writers. Readers will be deeply touched by the heroine's stirring reflections on human warmth and her repeated assertions that she is mentally competent and fit to make her own legal decisions.' Morrison added that, without spoiling too much, he could reveal that the book's final pages feature a fully notarized last will and testament signed by the author herself.","entertainment, books, news in brief, vol 51 issue 28, entertainment"

'If the song means something else to you, that's still cool, but there were lots of people who wanted to know what we were driving at.' Gibbons went on to say, however, that most of ZZ Top's songs, such as the anti-apartheid anthem 'Tush,' were pretty straightforward.","entertainment, news, music, news in brief, vol 51 issue 27, entertainment"

'All Disney princesses have extraordinary stories and inner qualities that make them wonderful and unique, but we've always lacked a heroine who hasn't yet slept with her boyfriend or another male character. We are proud that Lily will finally provide a princess to look up to for the large demographic of young girls who, due to age, choice, or unavailability of sexual partners, have not yet experienced intercourse.' Disney representatives added that sexually active girls would also love Lily's best friend, Princess Misty, who lives in a neighboring enchanted realm and just moved in with her slightly older boyfriend, Clint.","disney, entertainment, movies, news in brief, vol 51 issue 26, entertainment"

814,Comic Book Fans Adamant That Human Torch Be Played By Actor Whose Body Actually Engulfed In Flames,"WASHINGTON'Expressing their frustration with the casting for the new Fantastic Four film, comic book fans across the country were reportedly adamant Monday that the superhero the Human Torch should be played by an actor who is actually engulfed in flames. 'They should have stayed true to the original comics and selected an actor whose entire body is on fire,' said longtime Fantastic Four fan Barry Reich, criticizing filmmakers for casting Michael B. Jordan, who, unlike the comic book version of the Human Torch, is not enveloped from head to toe in flames. 'Hollywood screwed up big time. It makes no sense for Susan Storm's younger brother, Johnny, to be played by a non-ignited man. Since 1963, the Human Torch has always been able to generate powerful streams of flames and fireballs, and to ignore that is insulting to Fantastic Four creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby.' Comic book fans, however, reportedly commended Fantastic Four director Josh Trank's bold choice to cast a hyper-intelligent actor with multiple scientific doctorates and an elastic body as Mister Fantastic.","entertainment, comics, pop culture, news in brief, vol 51 issue 25, entertainment"

'Man, I knew they had some big surprises in store, but to kill off that enchanted hobgoblin or mage or whatever? That was insane,' viewer Adam Koskei said of the episode's unexpected climax, which not only featured the death of some sort of little warlock-type character, but also included a major secondary plot twist in which the centaur Stonebane Darkwind or maybe Kyrus Valorheart finally cast an ancient spell or something to that effect. 'And it was so crazy how he was killed with that cursed rune or a fire-axe or a similar thing in that vein! I thought for sure he was going to get that chair, but now it seems like the Grand King or Magic Duke or whoever will get it instead.' The show's fans added that they could barely wait to see whether the dragon-riders could protect the castle from the gorgons or whatever-the-fuck in next week's season finale.","entertainment, television, game of thrones, news in brief, vol 51 issue 23, entertainment"

819,New Music Festival Just Large Empty Field To Do Drugs In,"MOUNT STERLING, KY'Declaring the event a rousing success so far, organizers confirmed more than 45,000 people turned out Wednesday for the first annual Cavalcade Folk and Roots Festival, a four-day gathering that consists solely of a big empty field to do drugs in. Held on a farm in the foothills of eastern Kentucky, the festival, which continues through Friday and features no live performances of any kind, reportedly offers 'something for every type of music lover,' specifically a fenced-off, 300-acre pasture in which to consume a broad array of mind-altering substances. 'We thought it'd be awesome to host a festival that would attract people from all over the country who just want to kick back and ingest narcotics for 96 hours straight,' festival organizer Randy Felder said of the event that takes place on a barren expanse of land with no stages, sound equipment, lighting, art, or vendors. 'Cavalcade is all about creating a venue where live music fans can come together, hang out, and do what they love most. Whether you want to toke up, huff, or take a few hits of E, we've got you covered.' 'And you couldn't ask for a better spot,' Felder added. 'I mean, it rained pretty hard yesterday, but people didn't let it bring them down. A lot of them didn't even seem to notice.' 'I always worry I'll miss out on something at big festivals like this, because there's never enough time to do all the drugs.' Officials reported that while the festival grounds contain no tents or any other form of shelter against the elements, ticket holders nonetheless came out in droves to the vast, otherwise deserted meadow to enjoy a number of big-name drugs, including marijuana, cocaine, and heroin, as well as a wide variety of less well-known substances and up-and-coming hallucinogens such as salvia, ayahuasca, ketamine, and several dozen improvised inhalants. While most attendees purchased all-inclusive four-day badges for $150, organizers told reporters they also sold $60 day passes to individuals whose schedules or budgets might not allow them to stay fucked up all weekend. 'The way I figure, you gotta stay all four days, especially if you're dropping a bunch of acid,' said Adam Steely, 24, who road-tripped 14 hours to Cavalcade with several friends whose names and whereabouts he could not recall. 'It's totally worth the price of admission. Things were kind of slow when we first got here'mostly just weed and some people doing whip-its'but things really got cranking once the Molly hit. I heard they've got Oxy over by the south entrance, so I'm definitely gonna check that out later.' 'I always worry I'll miss out on something at big festivals like this, because there's never enough time to do all the drugs,' Steely continued. 'I crashed early last night, and I'm still kicking myself for not being there when the nitrous tanks came out.' According to Cavalcade organizers, with the support of corporate partners like Vitaminwater, Uber, and Belvedere Vodka, they're able to offer a comprehensive festival experience, including a roped-off VIP section in the northwest corner of the field where festivalgoers who purchased $250 premium passes can sit in the shade if their heart rate gets too high or help themselves to complimentary vials of Narcan if they're actively overdosing. 'Everyone says Flakka is going to be the highlight of the festival, so I'm getting pretty pumped for that,' said attendee Meghan Young, 26, standing among a large group of festivalgoers who were dancing, whooping, and bobbing their heads on the east side of the grounds. 'Everything's been great so far. I met these really chill guys from Austin, and we all just sat around and stared at this tree stump for, like, hours and hours. It was the most amazing experience. Plus, I've seen some really great musicians today.' 'I still can't believe Lil Wayne is here,' she added. 'He's been at it for almost 12 hours straight.'","entertainment, music, drugs, news, vol 51 issue 22, entertainment"

824,Six Flags Adds Sleeper Cars To Its Roller Coasters For Passengers Who Prefer More Restful Ride,"GRAND PRAIRIE, TX'In an effort to accommodate passengers who wish to relax and get some rest during their ride, amusement park operator Six Flags confirmed Friday it had begun to add sleeper cars to all its roller coasters throughout North America. According to company sources, the specially modified cars feature private compartments, polished brass lap-bar restraints, and plush seats that can be folded down into a sleeping berth, allowing passengers to slumber peacefully for the full one-to-four-minute duration of their ride. 'With our new sleeper cars, Six Flags guests can enjoy all the high-speed thrills of our roller coasters, yet still wake up feeling fully refreshed and energized afterward,' said company CEO James Reid-Anderson, who noted that the compartments feature more than four times the space of regular seats, providing ample room to stretch out for anyone who meets the minimum height requirements. 'They're the perfect option for passengers who want to kick back and take it easy as they experience the pulse-pounding drops, twists, and loops of rides like Kingda Ka and Superman: Escape from Krypton.' 'You can settle in, unwind, and, if you like, be fast asleep by the time the coaster hits its first corkscrew,' Reid-Anderson added. 'Sure, it costs a little bit more, but it's worth it just to be able to lie down and relax for 90 seconds rather than being stuck next to a bunch of noisy strangers the whole ride.' Though a limited number of family suites accommodating up to four riders are available, most of the sleeper cars are reportedly designed to allow two adults to rest comfortably while undergoing hammerhead turns and zero-gravity rolls at speeds that can exceed 100 miles per hour. Six Flags officials said ride attendants are committed to ensuring the highest quality of travel for sleeper car passengers by tidying up compartments and replacing linens between each ride, ensuring customers experience up to six Gs in the most comfortable surroundings possible. The initial reaction from customers has so far appeared to be positive, with many roller coaster enthusiasts saying that, even on occasions when they don't feel like sleeping, they appreciate being able to do some reading or get a little work done in the spaciousness and privacy of their own car. 'After riding in a sleeper car for the first time, I immediately realized it was the best way to travel through inline twists and reverse sidewinders,' said Six Flags Over Texas visitor Maria Vargas, who added that she can no longer imagine going on a long three-quarter-mile track without being able to fully recline in her own sleeper car. 'Sure, it costs a little bit more, but it's worth it just to be able to lie down and relax for 90 seconds rather than being stuck next to a bunch of noisy strangers the whole ride.' 'Just look at how calm I am in the rider-cam photo,' continued Vargas, holding up a snapshot in which she can be seen resting soundly in bed as the coaster plunges 255 feet downward into the first of two 540-degree spirals. Vargas also told reporters that when she sees the passengers sitting in the roller coaster's regular seats, all she can think about is how uncomfortable they look and how much their necks must hurt after sitting in such tight quarters all ride long. Many amusement park patrons agreed with her, emphasizing how essential the sleeper cars have become to their regular routine. 'I've always hated how cramped and confined I felt on roller coasters, so being able to put my feet up and lie back as soon as we start climbing that first 45-story hill is a huge plus,' said Arthur Cho, a New Jersey native who frequents Six Flags Great Adventure. 'And when the ride's over, I feel great'though I can tell those passengers in the other cars didn't sleep a wink.' 'Plus the sleeper cars are right next to the dining car, so you don't have far to go if you get hungry,' Cho added.","entertainment, news, amusement parks, vol 51 issue 20, entertainment"

843,Catching Up On 2 Seasons Of 'House Of Cards' Depressingly Manageable,"SOMERVILLE, MA'Noting that he only needs to watch 26 full episodes of the political drama, local man Ben Atwell revealed Thursday that catching up on the previous two seasons of the Netflix show House Of Cards should be depressingly manageable. 'I shouldn't have any trouble getting through both seasons in the next few days,' said Atwell, who told reporters that he currently does not have any obligations in his life that might prevent him from maintaining a comfortable, extremely sad pace of watching six or seven of the hour-long episodes each day. 'Making sure I get a full eight hours of sleep each night won't be a problem either, even if I decide to take short breaks every couple episodes. Should be a breeze.' In a final heartbreaking statement to reporters, Atwell described the sense of grief he expects to feel after running out of episodes to watch when he finishes viewing the new season by Saturday evening.","entertainment, television, news in brief, vol 51 issue 08, netflix, entertainment"
844,Report: Only 40% Of Celebrities End Up Marrying Their Stalkers,"LOS ANGELES'Revealing that the success of such relationships is far less certain than typically assumed, a report released Wednesday by UCLA's Department of Sociology found that only 40 percent of celebrities ultimately end up marrying their stalkers. The comprehensive, multiyear study determined that actors, recording artists, and other public figures who are subject to constant verbal harassment and physical intimidation by an obsessive stalker choose to wed this person in less than half of all cases, with researchers concluding that marital bliss between a celebrity and the individual fanatically tracking his or her every move is by no means an assured outcome. 'After examining thousands of instances in which a stalker forcibly intruded on a celebrity's private life, we discovered that such behavior led to a long, happy marriage between them just four times out of 10,' said the report's lead author, Brian Lewis, explaining that famous individuals don't necessarily feel a strong romantic connection with the people who show up unannounced at their homes in violation of multiple court-issued restraining orders. 'Remarkably, for those individuals who root through a celebrity's garbage can or leave them rambling voicemail messages multiple times a day, the odds of the object of their fixation entering into a lifelong relationship with them are actually slightly against them.' 'In fact, a given movie star or television personality quite frequently will not seek a future with the person who is repeatedly caught hiding in the shrubbery outside his or her bathroom window,' Lewis added. The UCLA researchers found that, in most cases, celebrities did not pursue courtships and ultimately accept marriage proposals from the men and women who routinely followed them at a short distance as they went about their days, a finding that suggests public figures are not automatically attracted to such intensely obsessed individuals. 'Interestingly, we found that some subgroups of celebrities, such as soap opera actors, will settle down with the individuals who push their way past security in order to tearfully confront them on set just 30 percent of the time.' Indeed, the collected data revealed that three-fifths of all reality show contestants, character actors, Olympic figure skaters, bestselling authors, and TV weathermen deliberately spurn such individuals who break into their penthouses and steal several items of their clothing. The report also revealed that a narrow majority of pop stars opted not to spend the rest of their lives with those ex-convicts and former fan club presidents who were intercepted by bodyguards before having the chance to deliver a tattered notebook containing hundreds of hand-scrawled poems detailing their undying devotion. 'While we determined that some types of celebrities, such as swimsuit models and cable news anchors, tend to marry their stalkers slightly more often, it turns out that, in general, most famous people prefer to have no romantic contact with these individuals whatsoever, or will only date them for a couple of months,' said report co-author Erica Tarver, pointing to just a few dozen instances in the past year in which an A-list Hollywood starlet eloped with a stalker and then moved into his squalid one-bedroom apartment with him. 'Interestingly, we found that some subgroups of celebrities, such as soap opera actors, will settle down with the individuals who push their way past security in order to tearfully confront them on set just 30 percent of the time.' 'Then again, former Disney Channel actresses fall madly in love with the men who follow their existing boyfriends home from work and threaten them with a hammer about three quarters of the time,' she continued. 'But overall, it averages out to little more than a third of our nation's biggest stars and their stalkers saying 'I do.'' The report concluded that the likelihood of celebrity-stalker marriage varies considerably depending on the dedication of the stalker, with public figures being far more likely to tie the knot with someone who proves capable of overcoming whatever legal and physical obstacles are placed in their way over several years of pathological obsession. 'While the statistics are against stalkers marrying celebrities, those who remain most persistent in their efforts have a better-than-average chance of convincing their beloved that they are meant to be together, no matter how much time they spend in prisons or mental facilities,' Lewis said. 'However, it's important to remember that just because a daytime talk show host may choose to exchange vows with the person who posed as an electrician in order to install a surveillance camera in her dressing room, that doesn't necessarily mean that their marriage is fated to last. After all, given the national divorce rate, that 40 percent chance of staying together for the rest of their lives is actually closer to 20 percent.' 'But that doesn't mean there aren't many celebrity-stalker couples out there beating the odds,' continued Lewis. 'After all, Jay Z stalked Beyoncé for almost a decade, and look at the two of them.'","entertainment, celebrities, news, vol 51 issue 08, entertainment"

846,Person Who Clearly Hasn't Seen 'The Fifth Element' Arguing There No Good Roles For Women,"HOUSTON'Revealing her total ignorance of the 1997 science-fiction classic, local resident Erin Marshall, a corporate consultant who has clearly never seen the film The Fifth Element, reportedly complained Monday about Hollywood's lack of good acting roles for women. 'When it comes to big-budget movies, women are always forced to play either a one-dimensional heroine or a bland, forgettable love interest for a male protagonist,' said Marshall, who is doubtlessly unfamiliar with Milla Jovovich's star-making turn as super-powered extraterrestrial humanoid Leeloo, a complex and compelling character exhibiting emotional vulnerability, extreme intelligence, and a wide range of martial arts talents. 'There's an unsettling scarcity of parts that celebrate and challenge the female actor, and it's just really disappointing [that I've never seen the cinematic tour de force that is The Fifth Element, and still remain unaware of Jovovich learning an entire fictional language to prepare for the film].' At press time, Marshall's argument that there are also no good roles for African-American actors was thoroughly disproved by Chris Tucker's iconic portrayal of flamboyant talk show host Ruby Rhod.","entertainment, movies, women, news in brief, vol 51 issue 08, entertainment"

'I don't want to pick at these piece by piece, so I'll just wait until later, when I can really, truly indulge myself,' said Lauriston, adding that she would gorge upon what Sienna Miller, Jessica Chastain, and Lupita Nyong'o wore when things got slow around three. 'Maybe I'll check out the first few slides as a succulent little reward for getting through these emails, but the true banquet comes later, when I click through the whole slideshow several times until I've had my fill.' Sources later confirmed that Lauriston had already scarfed down the slideshow as well as an entire 'Oscars Baubles And Bracelets' article before noon.","entertainment, celebrities, movies, fashion, news in brief, vol 51 issue 08, entertainment"

'Richard [Linklater] guessed they'd have trays of stuff going around, but even if that's true, it might be gone if we don't get there really early,' said Best Supporting Actor nominee Robert Duvall, adding that the Golden Globes after-party had food, so it'd be kind of odd if the one for the Oscars didn't. 'Maybe I'll grab a granola bar or a bag of almonds beforehand. That way, if there's no food, at least I won't be starving. Then I can swing by In-N-Out Burger on the way home.' At press time, Duvall was asking Birdman director Alejandro González Iñárritu if he thought the after-party would be open bar.","entertainment, oscars, food, movies, news in brief, vol 51 issue 07, entertainment"

'Look how close they are. There's so many different ones. I like when one stands up and goes up the stairs and starts talking.

'Oh, to have a face so fair as to be among those happy people, instead of this horrible visage that condemns me to the shadows,' said the Hunchback as he reportedly swung from the theatre's weighted ropes to raise the curtain on John Legend and Common's performance of the Oscar-nominated song 'Glory,' lamenting that but a glimpse of his grotesque form would sicken the actors and actresses he so adored. 'Alas, it is only here, hidden amongst the darkness and the dust, that one so hideous as I may dwell. But soft! My beloved Jessica Chastain speaks!' At press time, the Hunchback had cradled to his chest a crudely formed Oscar made from trash discarded at last year's ceremony.","entertainment, oscars, movies, news in brief, vol 51 issue 07, entertainment"

852,Half Of Hollywood Test Group Screened Placebo Film,"LOS ANGELES'Saying the methodology helps them ensure unbiased results in their marketing research, studio executives at Paramount Pictures confirmed that during a Hollywood test screening this week they showed half of all theatergoers a placebo film. 'Instead of watching our authentic big-budget studio film, this randomly selected control group saw a movie that lacked any recognizable star, overt 'high-concept' premise, rapidly unfolding narrative, or extensive computer-generated effects, so that we could compare their reactions with those of the real movie's viewers,' said Paramount production head Marc Evans, acknowledging that many members of the control group exhibited the same level of emotional gratification and entertainment as those who viewed the actual upcoming action-adventure blockbuster. 'Such a double-blind screening method allows us to determine whether the thrills, laughs, and heartbreak experienced by audience members actually stem from Arnold Schwarzenegger's performance in the Terminator sequel we have coming out this July, or whether they are simply the result of a placebo effect.' Despite poor findings that showed no significant improvement upon the placebo film, executives said they had already spent $170 million developing the franchise feature and would just give it a wide international release anyway.","entertainment, movies, news in brief, vol 51 issue 07, entertainment"

'Even his lesser works like The Snow Maiden or Vera Sheloga have so much to teach today's composer-arrangers, who no doubt owe a deep debt of gratitude to Rimsky-Korsakov for his virtuosity.'

859,Literary Study Finds All Modern Narratives Derived From Classic 'Alien Vs. Predator' Conflict,"OXFORD, ENGLAND'Explaining how the timeless clash between the two sides remains among the most elemental forms of storytelling worldwide, a study published Tuesday by researchers at Oxford University has concluded that virtually all modern narratives are re-expressions of the classic Alien Vs. Predator conflict. 'The Epic Of Gilgamesh, Paradise Lost, The Old Man And The Sea'each is simply a different culture's exploration of the ageless, universally relatable struggle between Alien and Predator,' said study co-author Dr. Gavin Horsley, who noted he has yet to encounter a civilization whose most prized written works and oral traditions did not derive from the prototypical confrontation between the savage Xenomorphs and their technologically advanced, extraterrestrial humanoid adversaries. 'Even when the conflict is internal, such as that of the titular character in Shakespeare's Hamlet, it's one's internal Alien versus one's internal Predator'an extension of the classic AvP ur-myth that underpins every fictive struggle.' Horsley went on to cite Aliens Vs. Predator: Requiem as 'a narrative Rosetta Stone' to deciphering any other sequel in the Eastern or Western canon.","entertainment, culture, news in brief, vol 51 issue 06, entertainment"

861,Teen Crafting Marketable Persona In Garage Hoping To One Day Win Grammy,"MODESTO, CA'Saying he is willing to do all the hard work necessary to succeed in the music business, local teenager and aspiring recording artist Morgan Reyes told reporters Sunday that he is in his garage every day crafting a widely marketable persona in hopes of one day winning a Grammy Award. 'It's always been my dream to win a Grammy, and I know that if I just put in the hours and tailor myself into a charismatic pop star with broad cross-market allure, I can make it happen,' said Reyes, 16, adding that the time he spends in the garage both after school and on weekends is the sacrifice required to develop a personality as magnetic, yet approachable, as all his musical heroes. 'It's a ton of work, and some days I'm not sure I have what it takes to be both non-threatening enough for the teen demographic and also down-to-earth enough to appeal to slightly older mainstream listeners. But it's all going to pay off when the obsessively studied character I'm presenting to the public as myself is holding up that Best New Artist trophy.' Reyes went on to say that he has known he wanted to be a musician ever since his parents paid a veteran Los Angeles producer to write his first song for him.","entertainment, grammys, music, news in brief, vol 51 issue 05, entertainment"
862,Local Los Angeles Awards Show Slated To Open For Grammys,"LOS ANGELES'Calling it a great opportunity for viewers to see some lesser-known talent, event organizers confirmed this week that local Los Angeles-area awards show the SoCal Music Honors will open for the Grammys Sunday night. 'With their high-energy celebration of performers in the greater Los Angeles County area, the SoCal Music Honors are expected to kick off the night with a lively show hosted by some real rising stars in the music-awards scene,' said David Fricke of Rolling Stone, adding that the recently formed event will have a tight 40-minute window to perform their show before roadies wheel away their equipment from the main stage and begin setting up for the Grammys. 'Obviously, most of the audience will be here for the Grammys and probably won't arrive until the tail end of the SoCals, but this will still be an incredible chance for these up-and-coming hosts and presenters to gain national exposure. Who knows, one day we might even see some of these same guys handing out trophies at the Grammys, or even the Billboards.' Fricke noted that the SoCals were actually a last-minute replacement after the awards show originally signed to open, the Santa Monica Indies, abruptly disbanded.","grammys, entertainment, music, news in brief, vol 51 issue 05, entertainment"

865,Man Carefully Settles On Backup Channel For When Airing Of 'Gladiator' Goes To Commercial,"CINCINNATI'Ensuring he would be exposed to minimal amounts of advertisements and downtime in his entertainment, local man Eric Sackett carefully settled on a backup channel to watch whenever AMC's airing of the film Gladiator entered a commercial break, sources confirmed Friday. Sackett told reporters he stumbled upon the film 15 minutes into its airing and immediately began searching for a secondary program the moment an advertisement appeared on-screen, eventually determining that a block of Deadliest Catch episodes on the Discovery Channel represented his best fallback position for the next three hours. 'Usually ESPN is my go-to backup, but SportsCenter was ending soon, and I didn't want to watch the college basketball game that was on next,' said Sackett, who reportedly shrank Gladiator into picture-in-picture mode as he scanned the digital guide for a program he would enjoy viewing every 15 to 20 minutes. 'I love The Right Stuff, which was on IFC, and honestly would've rather watched that instead, but I had already missed way too much of it to start. I had seen that whole season of Deadliest Catch, however, and knew it was pretty good.' 'I could just hop in and out of it, and it wouldn't really matter,' he added. Sources said that Sackett, content to watch the reality show for just two to three minutes at a time, was repeatedly able to jump to the program within seconds of Gladiator fading to commercial break. The 27-year-old told reporters that, in most instances, he was exposed to only a handful of words from the very first advertisement. As he began growing progressively more confident in his sense of timing, reports indicate that throughout the afternoon Sackett frequently tested the limits on how long he could linger on Deadliest Catch before returning to his feature movie. Sackett admitted to reporters that on one or two occasions he pushed his luck too far, returning to Gladiator after the film had resumed. 'I kept switching channels looking for something and eventually came across There's Something About Mary, which was good enough.' In light of such mishaps, Sackett reportedly resolved to sit through AMC's entire commercial break whenever he knew a good scene was coming up, at one point enduring full 30-second advertisements for Bud Light, Home Depot, Geico, Allegra, Little Caesars, and Theraflu to make certain he did not miss the part where Maximus impales a tiger. 'Everything was going well until they were both on commercial breaks,' said Sackett, who was then forced to frantically scramble for a tertiary option to fill the sudden void in entertainment. 'I kept switching channels looking for something and eventually came across There's Something About Mary, which was good enough.' 'But by then I figured Gladiator was probably back on,' he continued. 'So I just went back to that.' Having successfully used his system to avoid countless advertisements, reports indicate Sackett even began adding trips to his backup channel during moments when the film reached a scene with lengthy expository dialogue that, because he had seen Gladiator previously, he no longer required. 'At one point, I accidentally changed the channel when I meant to turn up the volume,' said Sackett, noting that he was unable to recall which three-digit number would send him to his backup channel, spurring a frantic search through the channels one by one. 'That's when I noticed Man On Fire was on FX, which is a movie I hadn't seen in a long time. And I kind of got sucked into it.' 'Then I would just watch Gladiator during the Man On Fire commercial breaks,' Sackett added. After he discovered that Gladiator was to be immediately followed by a repeat showing, sources confirmed that Sackett remained on AMC to watch the opening scenes he had missed the first time around.","entertainment, advertising, television, news, vol 51 issue 04, entertainment"
866,Consumption Of Buncha Crunch Reverently Paused During Unsettling Scenes Of 'American Sniper',"EDINA, MN'Despite thoroughly enjoying the chocolate candy as she watched the film, local woman Jessica Kirby reverently paused from eating Buncha Crunch Thursday during an unsettling scene in American Sniper, sources confirmed. According to reports, Kirby refrained from chewing the bite-size pieces of milk chocolate and crisped rice throughout the tense moment when Bradley Cooper's character trains his sniper rifle on a small Iraqi boy, respectfully holding the candy in the side of her mouth as the action unfolded on-screen. Sources went on to say, however, that Kirby kept her fingers close to the opening of the Buncha Crunch box in her lap in order to quickly retrieve another piece of chocolate when the camera cut to a less disturbing scene. At press time, Kirby was unsure if she could refrain from drinking her soda for the entirety of the main character's heartbreaking struggle with post-traumatic stress disorder.","entertainment, food, movies, news in brief, vol 51 issue 04, entertainment"

'Dammit, I should've just gone last weekend when I had the time, but I was too busy rewatching [The Hobbit:] The Battle Of The Five Armies,' said the regretful man, who, in an admittedly egregious and inexcusable oversight, spurned opportunity after opportunity to see the special-effects-heavy Ridley Scott blockbuster during its nationwide theatrical run. 'Sure, it'll eventually come out on Netflix and iTunes, but seeing it on some dinky TV isn't the same as experiencing the rush of watching Christian Bale take on the pharaoh with 200 other people. That only happens once, and I blew it.' Johnson added that, though it will in no way rectify the error, he hopes he'll get a second chance to see the film on the big screen during the Exodus: Gods And Kings 10th or 20th anniversary rerelease.","entertainment, movies, news in brief, vol 51 issue 04, entertainment"

'I've always liked Julianne Moore, and I think she's fantastic in this particular picture, but to be fair I need to take the time for an in-depth viewing of each of these actresses' pictures,' said Holden, who confirmed that he has only seen pictures of two of this year's nominated actresses, but planned to explore the nuances and subtleties of the entire field before reaching a verdict. 'I held off until the Academy revealed its choices, but now I'm actually kind of interested in checking out the Marion Cotillard picture. Who knows? I might even look at Felicity Jones' picture two or three times.'

Nobody's doing this figure.'

'All of our FCC marksmen are highly trained and authorized to neutralize any threat to public propriety, and in this instance, the real and imminent risk that an offensive word might be uttered on live airwaves necessitated the use of deadly force against film actor Matthew McConaughey,' said FCC chairman Tom Wheeler, praising the camouflaged sharpshooter who took up a position among the A-list crowd and kept his rifle's laser sight trained on the foreheads of whichever presenters and honorees were speaking onstage, as is customary at all live awards galas. 'It is unfortunate whenever the FCC must fire a lethal head shot to ensure a broadcast remains family-friendly, but we are tasked with a grave responsibility to protect the vulnerable viewing audience. Such executions are a small price to pay to ensure that millions of Americans are safe from language of a vulgar or sexually provocative nature.'

'Melissa's been spending a lot of time this week with some new book, so my best guess is that it's a historical fiction novel called The Midwife's Promise that takes place in 1820s New England or something like that,' said boyfriend Cameron Scott, 32, corroborating speculation that the book almost certainly features a proud, strong-willed protagonist named Adeline. 'Probably it's about a woman who loses her husband to cholera'maybe typhoid'and has to surmount various hardships in order to build a new life for herself and her children under the backdrop of post-Revolutionary America.

I can tell you it almost definitely has a chapter named 'The Schoolhouse.' That's for sure.' At press time, sources confirmed that the novel was most likely written by an individual who previously authored a book called Corrina's Garden.","entertainment, books, news in brief, vol 51 issue 01, entertainment"

'Our data indicates that while nearly four out of five copies of this bestselling compilation album can be found in the center console among old ATM receipts and a pen cap, the CD may also in certain instances be jammed edgewise between the center console and driver's seat,' said head researcher Lisa Peterson, adding that a vast majority of copies have a hairline scratch that causes the track 'Another One Bites The Dust' to skip approximately two minutes in. 'We also found that a small but not insignificant minority of these discs occupy a protective sleeve alongside a self-made mix labeled 'Summer 2002' or the Red Hot Chili Peppers' Californication.' Peterson went on to say that those few copies of Queen's Greatest Hits that are not in an automobile are currently stuck inside the dust-covered seven-disc stereo system that was put in the basement in 2007.","entertainment, music, news in brief, vol 50 issue 49, entertainment"

'A Bond film is known for its exotic locales, so I get a little nervous when I read about Sam Mendes securing the rights to shoot in downtown Concord and scouting covered bridges for the opening action sequence,' said fan Peter Harris of the series' 24th film, which will reportedly feature 007 tracking a shadowy terrorist organization through conservation centers, hiking trails, and craft museums throughout the rural state, culminating in a final confrontation at the Franklin Pierce Homestead. 'Sure, the clip of Daniel Craig emerging from a tiny submersible onto a beach at Lake Winnipesaukee is vintage Bond, but it's going to feel kind of lame and static unless they at least whisk us off to a maple farm in Vermont.' Fans were also reportedly divided over the decision to change the name of the film from Spectre to Live Free Or Die.","entertainment, movies, news in brief, vol 50 issue 48, entertainment"
884,CIA Admits Role In 1985 Coup To Oust David Lee Roth,"LANGLEY, VA'Shedding new light on a tumultuous period of upheaval that dominated international headlines nearly 30 years ago, the U.S. government declassified hundreds of documents Tuesday that confirm the CIA covertly organized and executed the coup that ousted lead singer David Lee Roth from Van Halen. According to a preliminary analysis, the newly released information includes more than 1,600 pages of formerly top-secret material detailing the CIA's clandestine plot to infiltrate the platinum-selling rock group and unseat the magnetic, impulsive musician from his leadership position in the spring of 1985. The documents reveal that the agency worked behind the scenes for years, beginning after the release of the disco-inflected 'Push Comes To Shove' single in 1981, to foment the internal turmoil and unrest needed to destabilize the band and ultimately force Roth to step down from the American heavy metal act. 'As Van Halen's creative direction became uncertain in the early 1980s, it became increasingly apparent that we would have to take the steps necessary to remove Roth from power,' said former Deputy Director of Central Intelligence John N. McMahon, describing the covert process by which he and his colleagues quietly forced a schism between the vocalist and members of the band's inner circle in order to disrupt the dangerous cult of personality that had taken hold around the hard-rock frontman. 'Well before the commencement of the Hide Your Sheep Tour, Roth had become too unpredictable, too brazen, and he was preventing the band's sound from moving toward synthesizer-driven, radio-friendly rock. So, we felt we needed to act, and quickly.' 'Quite simply, our office determined that Roth was no longer fit to exercise control over Van Halen, and that his aspirations for the band were not aligned with the best interests of the American people,' he continued. Dubbed Operation Diamond Cutter by the select top-ranking CIA administrators who orchestrated the plot, the confidential initiative reportedly sought to quietly undermine Roth's influence within Van Halen and replace him with Sammy Hagar, a charismatic but largely inert puppet leader who agency officials were confident would be easily manipulated once installed atop the iconic rock group. The CIA confirmed that it was able to exploit preexisting strains in the band by capitalizing on internal concerns over Roth's long-term musical ambitions following the release of his solo EP, as well as pent-up tensions that had simmered for years after the lukewarm commercial and critical reception of Van Halen's Fair Warning album. Additionally, American intelligence operatives succeeded in enlisting Roth's manager and utilizing the double agent to convince his client that relinquishing his position would allow him to pursue what was portrayed as a budding and potentially prosperous film career. 'Based on the things we heard coming out of Van Halen's studio at the time, we were given authorization from the highest levels of government to seek every possible avenue to subvert Roth's command,' said one CIA operative speaking on condition of anonymity, claiming that the agency recruited and trained numerous groupies and entourage members to ply longtime Roth ally Alex Van Halen with alcohol in order to ensure that he was in no state to oppose the takeover. 'Had we not moved when we did, there's no telling what kind of detrimental effect Roth would have had on the band's move into more mainstream pop territory and the state of rock music as a whole. We saw the opportunity to remove this uncontrollable megalomaniac from power while safeguarding the American people from his potent influence, and we seized it.' 'The last thing we wanted was to have another 'Panama' on our hands,' he added. As revealed by the CIA, prior to Roth's successful ouster from the group, the agency also funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars in untraceable funds through intermediaries to bankroll the production and distribution of such incendiary works as VOA and the 'I Can't Drive 55' single in order to bolster Hagar's profile in the eyes of the band's supporters. Despite the prevalence of critics who question the legitimacy of the post-Roth Van Halen regime, McMahon said that he has 'no regrets whatsoever' about the agency's false flag mission. 'Overthrowing Roth was a risky, highly controversial maneuver, but I believe that history will justify our actions,' McMahon said, acknowledging that the coup ultimately proved ineffectual, as the vocalist's departure merely ushered in a series of decreasingly competent replacements, culminating in Roth reclaiming his seat of power long after the band had ceased to have an impact in the international community. 'This was a self-aggrandizing degenerate who needed to be toppled in order to bring stability to the band's direction. We did what needed to be done.' 'That being said, none of us could possibly have foreseen that For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge would indirectly result from our actions,' he added, solemnly shaking his head.","entertainment, government, music, history, news, vol 50 issue 48, entertainment"

886,Millions Of Holiday Travelers Return From Parents' Homes All Caught Up On 'The Mentalist',"WASHINGTON'After visiting their parents over the long Thanksgiving weekend, millions of holiday travelers reportedly returned to their daily lives Monday having completely caught up on the CBS procedural crime drama The Mentalist. 'We watched a bunch of episodes from this past season, and my mom brought me up to speed on what happened earlier on in the show,' said Michael Ferree of Ithaca, NY, echoing the sentiments of Americans across the country who learned over the holiday that former-psychic-con-artist-turned-criminal-investigator Patrick Jane succeeded in tracking down and killing Red John, the serial killer who murdered Jane's wife and daughter 10 years earlier. 'Apparently, the mentalist was a fugitive for a while until the FBI found him and forced him to come work for them. Now, the show takes place in Austin for some reason. Also, at the end of last season, the mentalist got together with the main girl who was just about to move to Washington with this FBI agent she was dating. It's okay.' At press time, millions of Americans confirmed that they would finish watching season seven of The Mentalist during Thanksgiving weekend 2015.","entertainment, family, television, news in brief, vol 50 issue 48, entertainment"

888,Report: Majority Of Americans Know Which YouTube Clip They'll Post Following Dustin Hoffman's Death,"PRINCETON, NJ'Confirming that a majority of the country is ready for when the time comes, a study released Tuesday by researchers at Princeton University found that 81 percent of Americans know exactly which YouTube clip they'll post on social media upon Dustin Hoffman's death. 'Whether it's a scene highlighting Hoffman's versatility as a comedic performer in Tootsie, or the iconic closing sequence of The Graduate, our study found that four of every five citizens are poised and ready to share a video honoring the two-time Academy Award winner at a moment's notice,' read the report in part, which noted that a significant portion of the populace already has plans to caption their links with either 'RIP' or 'We'll never have another one like him.' 'And while we found that the remaining 19 percent of Americans do not have a specific clip in mind for Dustin Hoffman's passing, this is largely due to the fact that many of these individuals remain torn over which scene from Rain Man they would like to share, be it the famous Wapner scene, or the more touching kiss in the elevator, or another scene altogether.' The study follows a similar report released earlier this year that found that a mere 21 percent of Americans have a clip in mind for the eventual passing of Judd Hirsch.","entertainment, celebrities, death, internet, social media, news in brief, vol 50 issue 47, entertainment"

'Showing movies is actually how we make a lot of our money here, so in order to keep providing our clientele with a top-quality viewing experience, it's important that customers watch only those movies that we are offering. That is why we ask all patrons to kindly leave their full-length documentary features and action films at home.' Armstrong added that if customers are intent on viewing their own motion pictures, they must finish them up in the parking lot before entering the building.","entertainment, movies, news in brief, vol 50 issue 46, entertainment"

'This exciting program takes viewers back to 1995 as our parent company, A&E, decides to focus its resources on existing projects rather than launch a new network, and then follows the development of an unusual nonfiction television landscape completely different than the one we have come to know,' executive producer Janet Harper said of the six-part primetime event, which includes interviews with historical experts and employs computer simulations to explore what shows viewers might have watched instead. 'We'll delve into fascinating questions, like how would individuals have spent their Thursday nights in a world without Pawn Stars and Pawnography? What, if anything, would entertain war buffs with no Patton 360 or Battlefield Detectives? And whether the compelling stories of men who drive trucks across frozen Arctic lakes would have ever been told to a television audience.' Harper said she didn't want to give away any of the show's secrets, but noted that Swamp People would have found a way to exist whether there was a History Channel or not.","entertainment, history, television, news in brief, vol 50 issue 46, entertainment"

'Right now, we're just paying our dues by playing gigs around town, but it'd be pretty cool if someday we have a huge disaffected fan base that insists only our first two albums are worth listening to,' said lead singer and rhythm guitarist Jack Lewis, adding that the group aspires to someday team up with several high-profile Los Angeles music producers to create a more polished, radio-friendly sound despised by the band's original fans. 'Maybe five or 10 years down the line, I'd love to sell out stadiums and put on highly choreographed, overproduced shows that our current fans would claim don't even come close to capturing the raw energy that we had back when we were just playing small clubs.'

898,Navy Forms Elite New SEAL Team To Write Best-Selling Tell-All Books,"WASHINGTON'Describing the group as one of the most advanced and highly skilled special operations units in the world, sources within the Defense Department revealed Friday that the U.S. Navy had formed an elite new SEAL team dedicated solely to writing best-selling tell-all books. Speaking on condition of anonymity, sources confirmed that the task force was created earlier this year and that its members have undergone extensive training to prepare them to quickly and efficiently release popular accounts of covert operations in the War on Terror. The 32-man special forces team, assembled from the best autobiographers within existing Navy SEAL squads, is reportedly capable of writing firsthand narratives of highly classified missions under even the harshest conditions and within the narrowest time frames. 'We have conditioned these soldiers, who already possessed remarkable natural writing abilities, to publish sensational battlefield stories far beyond what an ordinary serviceman is capable of producing,' said a Pentagon official, adding that the elite commandos can complete a stirring first draft revealing advanced and confidential special forces methods in as little as six weeks. 'Whether it's about a top-secret mission to assassinate the leader of a terrorist cell in Yemen, or the amazing story of a midnight raid in Libya that supposedly never happened, these guys can sell 1 million copies without breaking a sweat.' 'When there's a potentially highly profitable story that needs to be told, this is the group that gets the call,' he added. According to sources, candidates for the unit must first undergo a grueling eight-month training course to provide them with the literary skills required to ensure their work ends up atop The New York Times Best Seller list for at least 12 weeks. Sources confirmed that an intensive battery of writing drills, which weeds out nearly 90 percent of the prospective authors, instructs SEALs on how to fully block out distractions while they focus on structure and style, as well as how to quickly identify the juiciest excerpts for pre-release marketing. In addition to their rigorous training, SEAL team members are reportedly equipped with state-of-the-art technology to assist them with their manuscripts, including military-grade dictaphones guaranteed to function in all climates and terrains, as well as an encrypted word-processing software designed specifically for them by the CIA. Leaked memos indicate that the soldiers are also aided by an experienced support team of ghostwriters and copy editors dedicated to ensuring that their work, which elucidates the U.S. military's most high-profile missions, is fully polished and highly marketable. The battle-hardened soldiers have also been known to quietly secure a $100,000 book deal with Dutton Penguin in as little as 15 minutes, according to sources. 'These soldiers are equipped for whatever press request is thrown at them'they are fully prepared to deploy with 24 hours notice to give promotional interviews on nearly any television program in the world,' said a Joint Special Operations Command official who requested we not use his name, adding that the men are often only given a short briefing from their commanding officers to prep them for an intense sit-down conversation with a seasoned reporter, be it on Charlie Rose, 60 Minutes, or even The View. 'They have incredible levels of endurance. Oftentimes they're sent out on book-signing tours of six months or more. Given the demands of today's publishing industry, they may only see their family a few times throughout the year.' 'But the pressure of delivering one of the year's best pieces of nonfiction doesn't get to them though,' the source added. 'These guys have ice water in their veins.' Furthermore, officials within the Pentagon confirmed that, in addition to their traditional role as special ops authors, the men are also ready at a moment's notice to carry out adaptations of their books into films or assist in the production of eye-opening documentaries when deemed necessary. 'Few among us could ever endure what these men face on a daily basis, holed up in their empty rooms, cranking out page after page of their heart-pounding first-person thriller,' said the unnamed JSOC official. 'We certainly owe them a debt of gratitude for the sacrifices they have made and their contributions to War-on-Terror literature. And as long as they maintain their silence, they do all of this without anyone knowing the remarkable efforts they've made.' 'These selfless individuals only care about one thing: ensuring that every single American has access to a captivating page-turner,' he added.","entertainment, books, military, news, vol 50 issue 44, entertainment"

900,Ira Glass Exhausted From Doing Every Single Voice On 'This American Life',"NEW YORK'Revealing that the creative demands of the long-running public radio program take a substantial toll, Ira Glass told reporters Thursday that he was exhausted from single-handedly doing all the voices for each episode of This American Life. Glass, who has personally recorded the vocal tracks for every reporter, essayist, and interviewee character since the show debuted in 1995, confirmed that after 539 episodes, the labor-intensive process leaves him feeling fatigued and mentally drained by the end of each week's broadcast. 'I have to say, I still love doing the program, and I embrace the challenge of creating different kinds of stories populated by interesting and unusual characters, but that undertaking can definitely wear you out,' said Glass, who sipped from a mug of honey-lemon tea while recalling the long 18- to 20-hour days spent alone in the recording studio. 'Just to be clear, there's nothing more rewarding than coming up with all these new characters every week. I delve in, play around with my voice, and experiment with a dialect or fine-tune a cadence until I capture exactly what, for example, a superior court judge or 12-year-old sleepaway camper should sound like.' 'The emotional investment involved in performing as an African-American schoolteacher struggling with budget cuts or a grown woman just learning she was switched at birth can be extremely taxing,' said Glass. 'You have to go into that space and inhabit that character all day long. I'm usually dead tired by the end of the week, but there's a satisfaction'fulfillment, really'when I turn on the radio and hear all of my voices in a completed show.' Despite the onerous workload and threat of burnout, Glass said that he is still driven to build out a new fictional world each week filled with the ambitious journalists, Jeep dealership salespeople, sage panhandlers, deceitful children, aircraft carrier personnel, FBI informants, self-conscious lucha libre wrestlers, former hostages, and overly divulging fathers that are beloved by fans of This American Life. Glass told reporters that, several years ago, he challenged himself to create as many fleshed-out characters as possible in the episode '20 Acts In 60 Minutes,' noting that he spent several weeks alone writing and recording an emotional song of apology performed by a few dozen teenage girls at a detention center, all of whom were meticulously voiced by Glass. 'I set aside a considerable amount of time to build a character, perfecting the vocal qualities, and figuring out what makes them tick,' Glass said. 'Back in 1992, before This American Life, when I was working on the Chicago Public Radio program The Wild Room, I was tinkering around with a new voice that had a hint of a Southern drawl and a slight lisp. But it wasn't until I raised the pitch, modified the inflection, added a self-deprecating delivery, and devised a background about growing up in a large Greek family in North Carolina that I had this great, urbane humorist character.' 'And that's how David Sedaris was born,' Glass added. Glass, who never digitally alters his vocal performances, relies on time-consuming manual techniques to shape the sounds on his program, such as speaking into a Styrofoam cup to mimic the degraded sound quality of a secret tape recording for a recent segment on the relationship between Wall Street bankers and federal regulators. Moreover, Glass said he taught himself a significant amount of Cantonese to accurately portray the characters he had scripted for the episode 'Mr. Daisey And The Apple Factory.' Though Glass records most of the characters separately and then edits the tracks together later, the 55-year-old confirmed that he tapes some interviews in real time, rapidly switching back and forth between two or more characters. The This American Life creator said that the task was easiest with well-worn recurring characters, like producer Nancy Updike. 'Doing all the voices for interviews is certainly challenging from a physical standpoint, but nothing like having to create an entire crowd,' Glass said. 'For the Harper High episodes last year, I came up with 352 different high school student characters. Those were particularly tough to record'I barely got through them. I lost my voice for two weeks after creating that pep rally.' 'I actually conceived this lovable freshman named Spud for that show who I really liked who I ended up having to cut in editing,' he added. 'Hopefully I can bring him back for a story on navigating through the peculiarities of adolescence or maybe mother-son relationships.' Adding to his exhaustion each week, Glass said he'll often head into an adjacent studio to record and mix some plaintive tremolo guitar tracks for in between acts, followed by several hours in a foley studio where he might use a metal rake to produce the sound of a chain-link fence creaking or press down on a leather bag filled with corn starch to mimic the crunch of snow underfoot. 'It's certainly a lot of work, and I rarely get enough sleep, but I wouldn't still be doing it after 19 years if I didn't love it,' he said. 'The hardest part is that I don't even know who the real Ira Glass is anymore.'","entertainment, news media, news, vol 50 issue 44, entertainment"
901,Farmers' Almanac Predicting Short Season For Primetime Dramas,"LEWISTON, ME'Calling for a harsh autumn of shortened series orders and meager Nielsen ratings, this year's edition of the Farmers' Almanac has reportedly predicted an unusually short season for primetime dramas, sources confirmed this week. 'Barren network conditions and an unfavorable viewing climate will leave residents nationwide with a stunted yield of new police procedurals and legal dramas over the final months of the year,' reads the 196-year-old publication's calendar section, which forecasts the upcoming season of dramatic programming to be the least bountiful in over 30 years. 'A bumper crop of midseason replacements may provide some relief from the abbreviated Sunday night lineups, and Chicago P.D. will continue to thrive. But most should prepare their DVR and Netflix queue for a particularly dire spell of television until the coming spring.' Despite the bleak outlook, however, the almanac went on to suggest that basic-cable viewers could expect fall to bring an abundant harvest of shows about restaurant makeovers, DIY home renovators, and swamp people.","entertainment, television, news in brief, vol 50 issue 44, entertainment"

909,TV Show Under Fire For Depicting Murder,"LOS ANGELES'In what is being described as perhaps the most shocking and distasteful moment in broadcast history, the popular primetime television show Criminal Minds is facing heavy criticism today for airing an episode that depicted the act of murder. 'Needless to say, the millions of viewers who saw, for the first time ever, one human take the life of another Wednesday night were left deeply disturbed,' said Stephen Atkinson of the Paley Center for Media, noting that while dozens of shows have made references to murder by either showing characters discover a dead body after the fact or implying a homicide was taking place by playing the sounds of gunshots occurring offscreen, no program had ever been so bold and provocative as to actually portray a cold-blooded killing in its entirety. 'A few individuals are defending the show in the name of artistic freedom, but it appears that the vast majority of Americans have found the images of a man being gunned down right there on their TV sets to be an inexcusable violation of the rules of common decency. Several key sponsors have already pulled their support from the network, and given how far beyond the pale this truly was, I very much doubt that even an apology from the show's creators will be enough to quell the public backlash.' Atkinson said he hopes that, at the very least, the incident will help spark a national dialogue on violence in the media and in American culture at large.","entertainment, death, television, violence, news in brief, vol 50 issue 41, entertainment"

Scott Fitzgerald defined the Jazz Age era of excess and romance with his writing, so I think it's fair to question why Ken Burns hasn't shown his face anywhere near our robust archives,' said estate representative Phyllis Westberg, adding that the filmmaker would have so much access to the handwritten journals, original novel manuscripts, and historical photographs of F. Scott, Zelda, and fellow expatriates at the Café Montparnasse that he could 'crank out a fucking amazing six-part miniseries event' in a single visit. 'Maybe you call it The Lost Generation, and focus on him, Hemingway, and Faulkner rising to prominence together. Or you make it all about F. Scott himself, and really go into detail about his time at Princeton, the Hollywood years, his tragic decline into alcoholism. Christ, I just wrote the whole goddamn thing for that oblivious little twerp.' At press time, Westberg added that if Burns could find a way to do a documentary on Mark Twain, he sure as shit could make some time for the man who wrote The Great Gatsby.","entertainment, history, ken burns, culture, books, news in brief, vol 50 issue 37, entertainment"
918,"Reclusive Deity Hasn't Written A New Book In 2,000 Years","NEW YORK'Leading writers, scholars, and publishers gathered this week at Fordham University for a literary conference and panel discussion on God, the widely praised but reclusive deity who has not published a book since His landmark debut 2,000 years ago. Hailed by critics as one of the most important authors in recent millennia, the eccentric divinity is said to have long ago retreated from the public eye, eschewing a life of celebrity for one of solitude and quiet. To this day, experts confirmed, His artistic reputation rests exclusively upon His bestselling and highly acclaimed first work, the Bible. 'God has granted no interviews, made no public appearances, and kept entirely to Himself for what seems like ages, and yet it's fair to say that no other author has been quite so influential,' said noted critic and conference attendee James Wood, observing that while the fiercely private immortal being has only one book to His credit, He remains among the world's most respected and quoted writers. 'For many readers, God's writing had a transformative impact on their lives, and countless people list His book among their favorite titles. But for reasons that we can only speculate about, God has chosen to stay out of the limelight and let His words speak for themselves. Perhaps it is God's retreat into His own world that allowed Him to render His vision so vividly on the page.' 'It's also possible that, with the first book, He simply said everything He had to say,' Wood continued. 'Though one would think a writer of such impressive knowledge and power would never lack for inspiration.' Many within the literary community suggested that God might well have become a victim of His own success, arguing that the enormous pressure to write a book as well-loved as the Bible'to which any new work of His would inevitably be compared'had simply proved too daunting. Regardless of His reasons, experts agreed that the Supreme Being's public absence had only added to His mystique. According to publishers, who predict that the Bible will remain in print for many years to come, the popularity of the famously secretive deity remains so high that just about anything new He released would be an instant commercial success. 'Certainly in the book business we've been wondering for a very long time what He's been up to, whether or not He's still writing,' said publishing executive Sandra Eakins, who brushed aside concerns that a lackluster follow-up to the Bible might damage God's reputation. 'Maybe He writes for His own pleasure and has no desire to publish anything new. I can respect that, but at the same time, it's a tragedy for His readers.' 'We'd absolutely love to see more stories, psalms, epistles'anything He has,' Eakins continued. 'In His first book, He created this dense, sprawling, multifaceted universe, and there are readers out there clamoring to know what's happened to all those characters since the Bible ended.' Eakins said the Lord Almighty retains an incredibly loyal international readership and, to this day, His writing continues to attract legions of devotees. Since the time of the Bible's first publication, when God was heralded by critics as a promising new talent, successive generations of booklovers have reportedly found themselves returning again and again to what they regard as a timeless and enduring classic. Many of God's most ardent fans still make regular attempts to contact Him, sources said, despite the fact that the reclusive being is infamous for never responding. 'It's understandably very difficult for people to accept that a deity could create an epic as complex, beautiful, strange, and enduring as the Bible, and then just stop writing altogether'cutting off all ties and making Himself completely inaccessible,' said Professor Charles Boutwell, a panelist at the conference and a self-proclaimed admirer of the God of Heaven and Earth. 'However, the qualities that make God so mysterious to us are the very same qualities that make Him such a unique voice.' 'It's natural to want more,' Boutwell added.

920,Concert Security Drastically Overestimating Fans' Desire To Get Close To Cheap Trick,"DAYTON, OH'Taking note of the dozen or so individuals standing in tight formation behind a row of linked steel barricades Tuesday night, sources confirmed that venue security at the Fraze Pavilion had drastically overestimated the desire of concertgoers to get close to the hard-rock band Cheap Trick. 'Back up, everybody! Everybody get back!' said one security guard to a cluster of fans approximately 30 feet away, who reportedly were showing no inclination toward advancing on the stage and who, in some cases, remained sitting on blankets. 'Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up! You got a pass? Band members and pass holders only! Just get back and let us do our job! Let's not have any problems.' At press time, following the encore performance of 'I Want You To Want Me,' eight members of the Pavilion's security staff had formed a protective huddle around the band and were rushing the musicians to their tour bus so that they could safely depart the venue.","entertainment, music, news in brief, vol 50 issue 36, entertainment"

927,Symphony Orchestra Simply Cannot Wait For Collaboration With John Mellencamp,"PHILADELPHIA'Saying the live performance will be a dream come true following decades of music study, members of the Philadelphia Orchestra announced Wednesday that they simply cannot wait for their upcoming collaboration with John Mellencamp. 'I've practiced the viola 10 hours a day for the past 25 years, received an education at the New England Conservatory, and partaken in three artist residencies, so the opportunity to serve as accompaniment to members of John Mellencamp's touring band is truly a great honor,' said associate principal violist Paul Chiu, adding that playing the same simple melody as the rest of the string section and the entire woodwind section during the chorus of 'Hurts So Good' would be a 'feather in the cap' of his distinguished classical music career. 'To repeat the same sequence of eight notes over and over again while staring at the back of John Mellencamp's head as amplified guitars and boisterous audience members drown out most of the sound'I can't think of a greater privilege than that. The only thing better would be playing with Jon Bon Jovi, but I'm not getting my hopes up.' At press time, Chiu had sequestered himself in a practice space for the day to rehearse his part for the song 'R.O.C.K. In The U.S.A.'","entertainment, news in brief, vol 50 issue 33, entertainment"

'Right from the outset, this film explores the dark underbelly of this so-called auteur, unearthing the ugly truth about his grasp on everything from sound design to storytelling,' said film reviewer Ella McNareth, who noted that after sitting through the damning exposé's silent five-minute opening shot of an abandoned factory, she would 'never look at this director the same way again.' 'Certain scenes are extremely hard to watch, and you're left feeling awful for anyone who played a part in its making. But as disturbing as it is, this documentary is required viewing for anyone who wants to fully understand how unqualified this director is.' McNareth added that perhaps if enough people were to see the documentary, Strable might never be able to make another film again.","entertainment, movies, news in brief, vol 50 issue 32, entertainment"

935,Groundbreaking Young Adult Novel Features Protagonist Who's A Bit Of A Loner,"BEND, OR'Poised to shake up the genre with its daring choice of protagonist, a groundbreaking young adult novel released this week by author Joan Berman reportedly makes the bold choice of following a moody, independently minded high school student who could be described as something of a loner. 'Rather than focusing on a popular member of the in-crowd, Happy Nowhere challenges readers' expectations by telling the outcast's story,' said book critic Anna Meier, noting that the work's convention-defying heroine, 16-year-old Shelby Sartell, doesn't particularly fit in with her classmates, sometimes gets teased and bullied, and even has a rather unusual family life. 'With this novel, Berman breaks the mold, giving voice to a young woman who isn't exactly part of the mainstream'someone you might say marches to the beat of her own drum. It's an audacious choice, but somehow, you actually find yourself rooting for the kid. I think we'll be surprised by how well teens respond to this trailblazing literary direction.' Meier added that in a fresh twist on the straightforward two-person relationships seen in most young adult novels, Happy Nowhere involves a more complicated love triangle.","entertainment, books, teenagers, news in brief, vol 50 issue 30, entertainment"

'Look, she's not perfect, but neither am I, so all things considered, I'd be inclined to test it out and give the two of us a chance,' said the sales associate, who went on to add that, while he couldn't make any guarantees, if he were to ever go on a date with the 23-year-old A-lister, he would make a concerted effort to resist forming snap judgments based on any potential faults, personal weaknesses, or off-putting personality traits that the celebrity might possess. 'You have to be willing to accept people as they are. Yes, Jennifer's a little loud, a little wacky and in-your-face, but I think, personally, I could get past that. Dating's all about keeping an open mind.' Robard added that he hoped Lawrence wasn't particularly religious, because that would, unfortunately, be a deal-breaker for him.","entertainment, celebrities, news in brief, vol 50 issue 30, entertainment"

'From throwing his signature arsenal of Pumpkin Bombs with his left hand rather than his right, to leaning in the opposite direction while riding the Goblin Glide, it's a fresh, new path forward for the character, and everyone at Marvel is excited for fans to follow the 'Sinister Southpaw's' reign of terror.'

954,"Universal Studios, Warner Bros. Enter Talks To Reduce Stockpiles Of Unproduced Reboots","LOS ANGELES'Conceding the time has come to limit the proliferation of new movies that simply rehash old ones, Universal Studios and Warner Bros. have entered bilateral talks to reduce their considerable stockpiles of unproduced reboots, sources confirmed Wednesday. Speaking to reporters after the first day of tense negotiations, members of both sides said that while building up enormous arsenals of remakes has long been their top strategic priority, the number of such revamped sci-fi franchises, action films, buddy comedies, and children's movies now in development has reached levels that represent an existential threat to the medium of film worldwide. 'We recognize that after years of pouring money into the same old material over and over again, we are one misstep away from unleashing something truly awful on our fellow man,' said Universal president Ronald Meyer, explaining that while hundreds upon hundreds of unproduced reboots sit stored in his studio's vaults, it would only take the release of a single new Hulk film to devastate most of North America. 'Should one party ever preemptively unleash an updated Edward Scissorhands, it would almost certainly be met by the deployment of a redone Labyrinth, causing an unstoppable chain reaction of similar retaliations across the entire industry.' 'We must install fail-safes to avoid a doomsday scenario in which the studios launch all their reboots upon the moviegoing public at the same time,' he added. Universal reportedly made the first diplomatic overtures by proposing remake-limitation talks with Warner executives, who agreed on condition that both studios impose caps on the number of old films they would rerelease in 3D each year. Those close to the negotiations confirmed that Warner Bros. pledged to abandon its planned reboot of Gremlins when Universal provided assurances it would scuttle an upcoming sequel to the 1988 Arnold Schwarzenegger'Danny DeVito comedy Twins. The two studios also consented to dismantle their large-scale programs for identifying potential prequels, according to reports. In addition, Universal and Warner Bros. agreed to begin the careful destruction of their Spider-Man and Superman franchises, respectively, with all scripts for future installments to be fully eliminated by 2029. Despite the progress, sources said negotiations stalled for an entire afternoon when Warner representatives refused to back down from their reboot of Mortal Kombat and walked out of the room, vowing they would not cooperate unless Universal immediately committed to pulling its forthcoming adaptation of the video game series Warcraft. 'A successful drawdown of our treatments for hundreds of films based on 1990s box-office hits and well-trodden comic-book properties will require a high degree of mutual trust,' Warner Bros. CEO Kevin Tsujihara said. 'We would certainly be open to utilizing a third party such as the Motion Picture Association of America to ensure that both sides comply with agreed-upon reductions in reboot numbers and to monitor studio lots to verify that teams of screenwriters are not secretly modernizing any preexisting film script.' Several close calls, most of which have remained hidden from the public, are believed to have provided the impetus for the current round of talks. Anonymous sources cited a particularly disturbing incident in which an erroneous report of an upcoming Tango & Cash reboot from Warner spurred Universal Studios executives to give the order for another live-action Flintstones. Only a last-minute phone call between levelheaded producers from both sides is said to have deescalated the situation. 'The outcome of these talks will have profound repercussions, with strict reboot limits potentially ushering in a more hopeful future for movie enthusiasts worldwide,' said film historian Arthur Spence, who described the power attained by Warner Bros. in 1947 after a team of producers and attorneys working in secret successfully rebooted the studio's ailing Rin Tin Tin franchise, touching off a decades-long period in which each major Hollywood studios built vast stores of remake scripts. 'The reality of the situation is that, at this moment, thousands of these unmade reboots have already been through the first stage of rewrites, are currently being punched up by script doctors, and could be ready to shoot within a few months. It's absolutely terrifying.' 'These negotiations, however, could greatly reduce the grave threat posed by these unfinished remakes,' he continued. 'At long last, it appears these studio heads are finally thinking long and hard about the kind of world they want to leave behind for their children.' While pleased with the steps taken during the first round of discussions, reports indicate that both sides still remain deeply troubled by rogue studio Lionsgate, which many suspect of secretly developing a fifth Expendables treatment.","entertainment, movies, news, vol 50 issue 23, entertainment"

957,Residents Plagued By Roving Pack Of Feral Celebrities Living In Hollywood Hills,"LOS ANGELES'Often spotted rummaging in backyards or skittering across local streets in tattered designer clothing, a roving pack of feral celebrities continues to plague residents living in the Hollywood Hills, sources confirmed Monday. The mangy film, television, and recording industry stars are reportedly proving a particular nuisance to homeowners, who say they cause property damage and often keep the neighborhoods they prowl awake with their loud, screeching vocalizations. Local business owners have also lodged complaints, saying the filth-covered celebs travel down the hills in groups by night to feed on scraps from dumpsters behind Spago and Chateau Marmont. 'Until we get this population under control, we ask that you securely fasten your garbage can lids, and whatever you do, please don't feed these celebrities or give them any attention'that will only encourage them to return to residential areas,' said neighborhood council president Anastasia Mann, urging residents to contact authorities immediately should they spot an aggressive starlet or litter of reality show contestants holed up underneath their porch or pool house. 'In many cases, these stars been abandoned by their agents or handlers. Most have gone years without a role or hit album, which has left them prone to desperate, erratic, and unpredictable behavior. ' 'Even though a frail, unkempt Freddie Prinze Jr., for example, may appear to be friendly, do not go near him,' she continued. 'There's no telling what kinds of diseases he may be carrying.' Local property owners said they have seen the nighttime scavengers raiding their bird feeders and digging up kale, chia seeds, and Swiss chard from their gardens, the glow of their beady eyes reportedly visible across darkened lawns. One resident said he recently turned on his outdoor light only to witness a tick-ridden Neve Campbell scurrying away from his trash bin with a half-empty yogurt container between her teeth. Though the exact size of the feral pack is unknown, officials estimate it has grown from roughly a dozen emaciated WB network stars back in 2011 to more than a hundred ravenous screen actors, models, Top 40 singers, and at least a handful of personalities from the World Series of Poker tour. The problem reportedly began drawing more attention last month after a car hit a scruffy, gaunt Skeet Ulrich on Mulholland Drive, and a bedraggled horde of former Disney child stars immediately began swarming his flattened remains. Authorities also confirmed the entire cast of the former NBC show Chuck had recently been found burrowing together for warmth beneath the 'D' of the Hollywood sign. 'I'd never seen one of those things up close until I found Adam Duritz rooting around in my garage a few months ago,' Aidan Hubbard, 53, told reporters outside his Whitley Heights home, where he said the Counting Crows frontman hissed and bared his teeth at him. 'He was just caked in dirt and had grass and leaves in his hair. We discovered he'd been living in our crawl space, and my wife felt so bad she set food out for him. I know they say that only makes the problem worse, but we just couldn't help but pity the furry little guy. Now I see those things everywhere.' 'Git!' he added, shooing away a scrawny Denise Richards lurking near his driveway. A number of residents have argued these derelict entertainers need help, noting that many appear to be in urgent need of medical care and a qualified stylist. Some may also require rehabilitation services, given numerous reports of frenzied, disoriented stars finding their way into houses and clawing apart bathrooms in search of prescription drugs. The growing nuisance has raised concerns over neighborhood safety, particularly following an incident in which an unprovoked Hector Elizondo of Chicago Hope fame was seen attacking guests at a backyard barbecue. Officials said the pests pose a threat not only to the community, but to the local ecosystem as well. 'Aggressive hunters such as Academy Award winner Geena Davis or Titanic's Billy Zane can dramatically alter populations of small mammals, sometimes even snatching pets from their owners' porches,' said Mann, who noted she no longer allows her Bichon Frise outside alone after a series of vicious encounters with Debra Winger. 'Obviously, something must be done soon. Just the other day my neighbor sat down to a breakfast on her patio only to find the bloated carcass of Patrick Duffy floating in their pool.' 'The best thing we can do is remain vigilant as we wait for trained casting directors to lure these creatures out of the woods with made-for-TV movie scripts or small cameo roles in studio films,' she continued. 'That way they can be coaxed into traps and put down humanely.'","entertainment, celebrities, news, vol 50 issue 22, entertainment"

961,Report: Growing Number Of Americans Forced To Make Ends Meet By Collaborating On Song With Pitbull,"MIAMI'In a further sign that the sluggish economic recovery continues to pose a challenge to the nation's workforce, a report published Wednesday by the U.S. Department of Labor revealed that a growing number of Americans have had to resort to collaborating on songs with Cuban-American rapper Pitbull in order to make ends meet. The paper, which attributed its findings to stagnant wages and lackluster job growth, confirmed that many poor and middle-class Americans have little choice but to pick up additional work with the chart-topping recording artist, often by contributing backing vocals, writing lyrics, producing Latin-infused beats, or repeatedly shouting the name 'Pitbull' in studio sound booths as a means of providing for their families in this challenging economic climate. 'Since the stock market crash and housing sector collapse in 2008, we've seen a staggering increase in the number of Americans who are putting in long, demanding hours behind the mixing console with hip-hop sensation Pitbull,' said economist Jared Coan, lead author of the report. 'While in decades past a single salary was enough to support a family of four, we are now finding that many breadwinners, out of financial necessity, are seeking out additional work laying down guest verses on dance-rap studio tracks like 'Timber' or any one of a number of its club mixes.' 'Most of these people are working a full day at their 9-to-5 jobs and then heading right into the RCA Records studio to program electronic drums for a Pitbull'Rick Ross collaboration until the early morning,' Coan continued. 'Then, if they're lucky, they have time to grab a couple hours of sleep before waking up the next day and doing it all over again.' Faced with mounting credit card debt, surging health care costs, and in many cases pricey college tuition for their children, citizens across the country are feeling compelled to supplement their take-home pay by joining Pitbull'also known as Mr. Worldwide'on recording dates and the occasional live performance on the Planet Pit World Tour, Coan said. Specifically, survey data indicate that tens of thousands of Americans'from cashiers and food service workers, to those in formerly solid middle-class jobs, like automotive workers and insurance salespeople'have to juggle their day jobs with playing claves on a Spanish-language version of 'Hotel Room Service,' spitting freestyle bars alongside guest hip-hop artists such as Flo Rida and T-Pain, and gesticulating toward the camera while filming a music video for 'I Know You Want Me (Calle Ocho)' or 'Maldito Alcohol.' Furthermore, the report found that many single parents are having to balance their family obligations with the financial necessity of working late nights arranging diss tracks directed against Lil' Wayne just to put food on the table, a trend that Coan called 'all too typical' in the current economy. 'Over the past seven years, we've seen a steady decline in real median household income in the United States, which corresponds with an equally sharp rise in the number of Americans finding samples for bouncing, house-music-inspired dance hall songs, such as 'Don't Stop the Party' or all the singles off the Meltdown EP,' Coan said. 'And given that rent payments and food and transportation costs have only risen, it appears these individuals will simply have to continue putting in full days at one job and then immediately don white linen suits and open-collar dress shirts so they can shoot a Bud Light commercial alongside Pitbull and his entourage.' When surveyed, most Americans confirmed they had few economic options, and stated that rapping alongside Pitbull was simply something they had to do to scrape by. However, many pointed to the unfulfilling and arduous nature of their efforts, with only a small minority of the respondents saying they receive health insurance or producer credits for their exhausting work with the Latin-American hip-hop artist. 'Between my job at a home improvement store, painting houses on the weekends, and shouting 'Miami Beach' through an Auto-Tune filter until I'm hoarse, I'm barely keeping my head above water,' said 42-year-old Michael Erickson of Scottsdale, AZ, who noted that he's grateful to even have the opportunity to pick up a handful of hours with Pitbull every week given the amount of musical collaboration work that lately has gone to overseas workers or Pharrell. 'Clocking out of my regular job at 5 and then flying off to Las Vegas to serve as Pitbull's hype man at the Billboard Music Awards isn't easy, but it's just a sacrifice I have to make if I have any chance of paying off my mortgage.' 'It's hard'I come home late every night soaked in champagne and I'm just too exhausted to spend time with my kids,' he continued. 'But the fact is that I'm doing this so that someday they won't have to.'","entertainment, music, our annual year 2014, summer music, news, vol 50 issue 19, entertainment"

964,James Cameron Says Future Of Movies Will Be Watching Them Sitting On His Lap,"LOS ANGELES'Calling his latest innovation the medium's most exciting advancement in years, Academy Award'winning film pioneer James Cameron said Friday the future of movies would be watching them while sitting on his lap. Cameron, the keynote speaker at a film technology conference held at the University of Southern California, delivered a 45-minute presentation to industry experts detailing the state-of-the-art experience of viewing a feature-length motion picture atop his lap, which he said would 'revolutionize cinema as we know it.' 'Within the next five to 10 years, nearly every major Hollywood movie will be watched from my lap,' Cameron said following a presentation that featured a 3D rendering of the Titanic director seated in a theater chair with moviegoers of various ages taking turns sitting down on his hips and leaning back against his torso. 'It will not just be the most immersive, thrilling, and groundbreaking way to experience the craft of film'it will surely be the most personal.' 'Ladies and gentlemen, this is the future!' Cameron added while patting his upper thigh. The Hollywood mogul went on to outline a number of the highly specialized features he foresees as part of his lap-based movie experience, including the 59-year-old clinging tightly to viewers during a movie's most suspenseful scenes, cradling them gently in his arms during emotional moments, and placing a warm blanket over any audience member who falls asleep on him. According to Cameron, the three upcoming sequels to Avatar will all be filmed to 'maximize the experience of sitting on [his] lap,' and will include an audio commentary option that allows him to whisper his perspectives on filmmaking into the viewer's ear throughout each movie. 'The warmth of my body and my breath against people's necks will one day be as integral to a movie as its cinematography or sound design,' said Cameron, explaining that his team is also in the process of testing a home-theater system that will allow him to arrive at viewers' doors holding a bag of popcorn and wearing a comfortable pair of sweatpants. 'I think as soon as people watch a favorite like The Wizard Of Oz on my lap, they'll say to themselves, 'Wow, that's how this movie was always meant to be experienced'on Jim Cameron's lap.'' So far, Cameron explained, only a handful of test audiences have been able to view movies on his lap, including his wife, his four children, his personal assistant, and producer Harvey Weinstein. Just before the end of his speech, however, the Canadian filmmaker offered to give a few conference attendees a 'limited preview' of the experience. 'I tried it out and it was a little weird at first, but after about five minutes or so, I got used to it,' said Sam Heinrichs, one of a dozen participants selected to sit on Cameron's lap and watch a 20-minute clip from Terminator 2 immediately following the director's presentation. 'James was very accommodating, and he even told me 'Watch this!' before all the good parts.' 'His lap was actually pretty comfortable,' Heinrichs added. 'I could definitely see myself watching another movie on top of him.'

968,Disney CEO Figures They've Built Up Enough Goodwill To Do A Real Sexist One,"BURBANK, CA'Citing a groundswell of praise for such stereotype-bucking princess films as Frozen, Brave, and Tangled, Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger said Thursday his company has probably accumulated enough goodwill to make its next animated feature a real sexist one. Though still unsure whether the forthcoming fairy-tale adventure would center on a helpless Dutch peasant who splits her time between domestic duties and pining for a rich man, a vain young princess who constantly preens in front of any reflective surface, or a curvaceous, long-lashed horse who inexplicably has rouged cheeks and eye shadow, top Disney officials agreed they are well positioned to sneak in an overly chauvinistic film that exploits antiquated female stereotypes for all they're worth. 'We've had a pretty solid run of strong, independent heroines, so I think we've racked up enough cred to get back to what we do best and make a regular old damsel-in-distress picture with some real heavy themes about purity,' said Iger, surmising that after the studio's recent streak of well-rounded female protagonists, audiences would surely let a 'real dumb one' slide. 'At this point, I think we'll be fine if we slip in a movie with some blond girl who always combs her hair, sings sad songs about the man she's longing for, and otherwise doesn't say much. Or maybe she's a foolish, overly emotional robin who is constantly patted on the head and kept in line by her knowing father.' 'Either way, she'll only be able to titter coyly, weep, or fret,' Iger continued. 'And she'll definitely completely alter who she is to win the heart of her love interest. I'd say we can probably get away with that.' Noting that critics have given them a tremendous amount of credit in recent years for creating female leads who are plucky, self-reliant, and get by on their wits, Iger said there will never be a better time to give the go-ahead to a screenplay that hinges on a passive young woman who does nothing but wait in place for a man to come validate her existence through marriage. The CEO also indicated that churning out a story in which all the female characters are either petty, naive, vapid, or love-crazy, and in which the lone voices of reason come from levelheaded male woodland creatures or paternalistic sorcerers, would be 'a walk in the park' for his creative team. According to Iger, Disney believes it now has the cultural cachet to make its most misogynist movie in years, perhaps by going back to a female lead whose life is empty, unfulfilling, and valueless until the moment she receives true love's first kiss. While the film has yet to be storyboarded, Iger added that it is a given that the heroine will be so helpless and unable to make decisions on her own that she will require the aid of small animals to guide her at critical moments. 'We're still kicking around ideas, but I can tell you that if we dip back into the princess well, the main character will be thin, pretty, and white'that much we're sure of,' said Iger, stressing that Disney's executive board had given writers the green light to 'revert to the basics' on this one. 'We don't have to do any of that Princess And The Frog garbage for a while. We did Pocahontas, we did Mulan, so we're all set for diversity right now. Audiences can expect a real porcelain-skinned one with disproportionately large blue eyes and a waist so small it couldn't possibly contain functioning organs.' 'And even though she's supposed to be just 15 or something like that, we'll definitely give her a full hourglass figure and a few skintight outfits,' he added. 'We definitely have enough goodwill in the tank to pull that off.' Executives confirmed that as long as Disney's audience is willing to bear with them on this one, a completely sexist blockbuster could prove to be a huge boon for the media company, spawning a lucrative franchise that could extend to several sexist sequels and even a degrading Broadway musical adaptation. However, Iger noted that the company's merchandising department would be the primary beneficiary of the movie's success. By implying to another generation of young girls that their principal value as individuals lies in being deferential, sexually desirable beings, the movie would help the company continue to cash in on its profitable line of princess-themed dolls, clothing, personal products, and video games, the CEO confided to reporters. 'Look, at the end of the day, we're trying to move some product here,' Iger said. 'No one asks for Mulan wearing shapeless warrior's armor for Christmas. So we're putting the next one in sparkly heels, a tiara, and a form-fitting dress slit to the thigh. End of story.'","entertainment, bob iger, disney, business, movies, our annual year 2014, gender, news, vol 50 issue 16, entertainment"

'Don't get me wrong, the music here is being blasted at a very high volume and is also really, really awful, but as bad as it is, it's still possible they could dig a little deeper into the catalog of Papa Roach or Staind and find something more terrible,' 34-year-old bargoer Kyle McCutcheon shouted as he plugged one ear and cocked the other forward while conversing with reporters. 'And even though it's playing very loud, they could probably turn it up even more, preferably until we're all forced to just sit around and stare at each other waiting for the few brief seconds between songs when we can actually exchange a few audible words.' When asked if there was anything else about the bar he would change, McCutcheon said that, if he was being honest, the bartender could be a tad more of a world-class dick.","entertainment, music, news in brief, vol 50 issue 16, entertainment"

Chang's restaurants nationwide. 'After taking some time off from recording, we're psyched to be back in the studio laying down 10 new tracks to serve as background noise while customers scan their menus and make light conversation over lettuce wraps with coworkers or visiting parents,' said frontman Joel Madden, noting that the band was aiming for a solid 40-minute album that P. F. Chang's managers could play on repeat without anyone noticing. 'When it's finished, it'll be the perfect soundtrack to blend in to the overall drone of clanging forks and chopsticks and the din of other tables' conversations. We've already recorded a couple great songs that we're excited for diners to not even consciously hear except for the roughly 50 seconds while they're in the bathroom, where the sound system is a little more clear and audible.' Madden added that if the album is received well, he could definitely see the band softly playing in some larger eating venues in the future.","entertainment, music, news in brief, vol 50 issue 15, entertainment"
973,Community Theater Gives Part Of Blanche DuBois To Kathy Fucking Hamilton,"PEEKSKILL, NY'In a surprising casting decision that has drawn criticism from numerous members of local community theater The Old Mill Players, sources confirmed Wednesday that the role of Blanche DuBois in the company's upcoming production of Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire has been given to none other than Kathy fucking Hamilton. Reports indicated that, yes, you heard that correctly: The 41-year-old real estate agent and mother of three has, for some insane reason, been selected to portray what is, hands down, the 2014 season's most challenging dramatic role. That's right, accounts confirmed, we're all supposed to sit back and believe that the woman whose past credits include Myrtle Mae Simmons in Harvey, Aunt Eller in Oklahoma!, and a handful of other bit parts is now poised to emerge from the wings and bear the full weight of the summer calendar's most highly anticipated production, as if that's not going to take some kind of goddamn miracle. I mean, Jesus, sources added. 'When I heard they picked Kathy, I immediately thought, 'You've got to be kidding me,'' said Old Mill set designer Ron Aiken, 51, who noted that while Hamilton is a serviceable ensemble member, director Gary Wheeler has completely lost his senses if he thinks she has what it takes to do justice to one of American theatre's most iconic and complex heroines. 'Could I see her as Eunice? Sure, why not? Kathy projects her voice, she's passable in character roles, she's got Stella's boozy upstairs neighbor written all over her. But Blanche? An aging Southern belle whose refined air masks a fragile, desperate inner self? Come on, don't make me laugh.' 'This is the same woman who flubs every other line and can never figure out what to do with her hands in any given scene, and you expect me to believe that she can carry a three-act?' Aiken continued. 'I'd pay good money to see that, but I'm not holding my breath.' Having beaten out seasoned Old Mill heavyweights Joanne Ludlow, Grace Pliner, and Joyce Pahr for the coveted spot, sources expressed their continued astonishment that Hamilton managed to walk away from last week's casting call with anything more than a three-line role, let alone top fucking billing. Specifically, reports indicate that Hamilton simply doesn't have the chops to handle a part like this, especially given her demonstrated difficulty getting her blocking down, her tendency to jump her cues, and, most crucially, the fact that her loud, maudlin overacting would make Tennessee Williams roll over in his goddamn grave. Furthermore, Old Mill insiders speculated that Hamilton must have blown that audition out of the water, which is difficult to believe if you saw her chewing the scenery in Our Town last fall, a train wreck of a production that should have taught Gary once and for all that you don't hand out marquee roles to supporting-cast talent. Sources went on to add that if they're being totally honest, Hamilton doesn't exactly fit the character's body type either. 'Can you honestly picture Kathy sharing the stage with Rick [Lesser]?' said Old Mill ensemble member Linda Cohen, 47, clarifying that Hamilton isn't necessarily unattractive, but that at a big-boned 5'9', she doesn't exactly present the unique mixture of Dixie elegance and delicate vulnerability that ticket holders will expect to see come opening night. 'Just look at the two of them'there's no chemistry there. Plus, the audience has to believe that Blanche is physically intimidated by Stanley, which just isn't going to work when you have Kathy Hamilton plodding around up there. No offense, but no one's throwing her across the room any time soon.' 'I'm sorry, but she just isn't going to be able to sell this one,' Cohen added. 'Listen, if I wanted unconventional casting choices, I'd go to Theater With A Twist.' Emphasizing that this is Streetcar, for Christ's sake, numerous Old Mill ensemble members acknowledged that Hamilton had in the past showed promise in Cabaret and Hello, Dolly!, but noted that the actress's singing and dancing abilities would not be called upon in her latest role because last time sources checked, there are no musical numbers in Streetcar. Moreover, several players questioned just what Hamilton thinks she's doing tackling Southern Gothic in the first place. Although, according to reports, if you're going to throw Kathy Hamilton up there you might as well turn the poker scene into a big glitzy dance number, because God knows choreography's the one thing she's halfway decent at. Hell, sources added, why not have her serenade Mitch after their date while she's at it? Unbelievable, sources repeated. Fucking unbelievable. 'Here we go'it's Picnic all over again,' Aiken said, referring to last spring's debacle in which Marsha Horowitz singlehandedly scuttled a production of the William Inge drama when she was miscast as Miss Rosemary. 'Marsha wasn't even the lead, but she dragged down that whole production anyway'and she actually had some talent. Now we've got Kathy Hamilton ready to do the same thing to Streetcar in just eight weeks.' 'Look, Kathy is an okay actress, but she's kidding herself if she thinks she's spotlight material,' Aiken continued. 'If I were her, I would gracefully drop out of this one and start gearing up for the Chicago auditions, but we all know that's not happening. God, what a disaster.' At press time, sources noted that they sure as shit weren't looking forward to seeing what Peekskill Daily Voice arts writer Roger Quinn would have to say about this one.","entertainment, our annual year 2014, news, vol 50 issue 15, entertainment"

'Originally we'd planned to shoot our new Josh Duhamel rom-com in Toronto, but when we considered the financial package offered by [Everest's] Advanced Base Camp, we realized we could film the whole thing there at 60 percent of the cost. Assuming the cast and crew survive the ascent up the Khumbu Icefall, how do you say no to that kind of deal?' said Sony Pictures executive Evan Green, who is currently producing a Joel Schumacher'directed courtroom drama, a superhero franchise sequel, a raunchy teen sex romp, and a film adaptation of the Broadway musical Nice Work If You Can Get It that are all slated to be filmed at the Hillary Step, a sheer four-story rock wall located 28,750 feet above sea level. 'Sometimes a little script tinkering is needed to work in the fact that everyone's wearing oxygen tanks and 50 pounds of climbing gear, but given the incredible savings it's nothing you can't smooth out in post.' Green added that the company hopes to begin shooting an Edwardian-era period drama at Camp IV on the southeast ridge as soon as the actors' swollen limbs reduce to normal size and they stop coughing up blood.","entertainment, movies, news in brief, vol 50 issue 13, entertainment"

983,Hollywood Maintenance Crews Sent Out To Patch Up Film Industry's Plotholes,"LOS ANGELES'Numerous Hollywood maintenance crews were reportedly dispatched early Thursday morning to fix a rash of plotholes that have developed across the film industry, with laborers called to fill in unresolved third acts and smooth over illogical character arcs at worksites on the Warner Bros., Universal Studios, and Paramount Pictures lots. 'Every spring we get reports of big plotholes from nearly every studio, and we have to send out workers to repair these deep, troublesome inconsistencies in films before they cause too many problems,' said Hollywood's Department of Cinematic Works commissioner Brad Barnett, who added that the plotholes tended to be worst just after the end of a long, arduous awards season. 'Plotholes can form due to poor studio conditions, the presence of implausible events, or a prolonged lack of attention by screenwriters. And if they aren't patched up by adding some solid dialogue or an additional explanatory scene, then the plotholes will continue to grow and we'll need to send in a specialized crew to tear up the script and do a complete overhaul on the underlying storyline. Not only are plotholes annoying for moviegoers, but if you run into enough of them, they can totally destroy your suspension of disbelief.' Emphasizing that regular maintenance was critical, Barnett said that he expected viewing conditions to improve significantly before the summer blockbuster season, when the number of plotholes is expected to quadruple.","entertainment, movies, news in brief, vol 50 issue 12, entertainment"

986,Nation Rallies Behind Embattled Celebrity Gown,"LOS ANGELES'In response to a rash of harsh criticism leveled against a gown worn by actress Charlize Theron at a recent Hollywood charity event, millions of Americans across the country have risen up this week to show their support for the publicly ridiculed garment, sources nationwide confirmed. Rallying against vicious critiques from celebrity news magazines, fashion blogs, and entertainment pundits, men and women from coast to coast are reportedly rushing to the defense of the widely derided sleeveless knee-length dress, with members of the growing grassroots movement issuing vocal statements condemning the item of clothing's savage treatment by the media and attempting to restore its sullied reputation. 'What those people have said about the gown is just plain wrong,' said visibly distraught Cincinnati resident Margaret Feinberg, referring to remarks from professional fashion critics who described the dress as 'shapeless,' 'unflattering,' and 'not a good look for Ms. Theron, not at all.' 'Some of the comments that I've read about the gown are not just uncalled for, but deeply offensive to anyone with a conscience. This beautiful piece of clothing needs our support, and we won't rest until our voices are heard by every style columnist and celebrity tabloid editor in Hollywood.' 'Enough is enough,' Feinberg continued, pausing momentarily to wipe a tear from her cheek. 'The gown deserves better.' The popular movement against the embattled garment's detractors has reportedly led to widespread boycotts against the entertainment news programs Access Hollywood and Entertainment Tonight, which each referred to the dress as a 'fashion flop.' Additionally, in the wake of their assertions that the outfit resembled 'an oversized sack,' celebrity gossip websites such as TMZ and PerezHilton.com are facing emphatic calls to retract their inflammatory comments and issue formal apologies to the gown. According to a recent Reuters poll, the vast majority of Americans are staunchly backing the green colorblock dress with black leather detailing, with 72 percent of respondents saying that the media never gave the gown the fair treatment it deserves, while a full four-fifths of those surveyed expressed outrage in particular over a recent post on StarStyle.com that described the article of clothing as something 'straight off the nightmare rack.' 'I stayed quiet when these animals went after Anne Hathaway's backless Prada ensemble after the 2013 Oscars, but I won't stand by idly and watch them shamelessly slander yet another innocent dress,' said Syracuse, NY resident Joshua Chen, whose online petition calling for the censure and termination of anyone who referred to the apparel as a 'train wreck' had at press time drawn upwards of 400,000 signatures. 'It just makes me sick to hear them say these awful things about a perfectly nice dress that never did them a bit of harm. Well, no more.' 'These people ought to be deeply ashamed of themselves,' Chen added. Sources confirmed that many of the publications that criticized the evening wear have already felt repercussions from the popular backlash, with numerous websites and magazines having lost millions of dollars in advertising deals from sponsors that do not want to be associated with such bitter sartorial attacks. Notably, Us Weekly, which reportedly described the gown as 'just plain blah' and placed the article of clothing in a 'Worst Dressed' photo collage, saw longtime ad buyer Kraft Foods sever its relationship with the publication earlier this week, with the conglomerate issuing a statement saying that the company 'is proud to stand alongside the gown.' However, despite their achievements thus far, supporters of the maligned dress emphasized they would not discontinue their efforts until the gown's good standing is fully restored. 'These people need to realize they can't mock a nice, respectable piece of clothing and expect to get away with it,' said Bismarck, ND resident Jenna Davies, wearing a custom-printed T-shirt bearing the phrase 'We Are All The Gown.' 'From now on, Hollywood's fashion commentators will think twice before going after a dress as lovely as that again. That's what this movement is all about.' 'Though, they can say whatever they want about that hideous, frumpy set of drapes that Angelina Jolie wore to the Academy Awards,' added Davies. 'Seriously, she should shoot her stylist in the face after that.'","entertainment, fashion, news, vol 50 issue 12, entertainment"

990,Nation Demands More Mind-Blowing Guitar Solos,"WASHINGTON'Voicing their calls for heavy distortion and completely badass riffs, millions of Americans across the country fervently demanded a significant increase in the number of mind-blowing guitar solos Monday, sources nationwide confirmed. Highlighting an unmistakable dearth of epic, amazing solos in recent years, Americans of all ages have reportedly called on the nation's musicians to play technically difficult licks on their electric guitars, preferably at lightning-fast speeds, stressing the importance that the solos be both 'loud as hell' and 'totally insane.' 'When I turn on the radio, I want to hear a killer solo where the guy just totally shreds it hard,' said 36-year-old Kent, WA resident Michael Pellone, echoing the sentiments of the vast majority of citizens from coast to coast. 'I want a solo so fast you can barely see the guy's fingers moving'where the guy's up on stage, one foot on top of a speaker, and just going nuts all over the guitar. That's what I want.' 'And not one of those short solos either,' Pellone continued enthusiastically. 'It's gotta be, like, three minutes. Three minutes of this guy fucking wailing up there and making his guitar do those cool squealing sounds you hear a lot. Yeah, it has to have a lot of that.' According to thousands of amped-up sources nationwide, a guitar solo in which the guy bends the strings really far while leaning his head back and grimacing is currently a top national priority. Additionally, citizens from all 50 states emphasized the importance of the guitarist running all over the stage, jumping off an amplifier, and then sliding on his knees through the lead singer's legs while rocking out hard the entire time. The U.S. populace also insisted that the solos contain several sections in which the guitarist uses his right hand to tap notes on the neck of the instrument just like Eddie Van Halen does in 'Eruption.' 'I like when they're just tearing it up on the low part of the guitar, but then they suddenly go up and play on the high part'they should do that lots of times,' said 31-year-old Mark Kessek of West Orange, NJ, adding that he really likes how it sounds when guitarists do long slides up and down the strings, so the solo should include a few of those. 'I also like when they do that wah-wah effect thing'that has to be in there too. But the main thing is that it has to be really fast. So fast you're just like, 'Whoa, fuck yeah!'' 'Yeah!' added Kessek, excitedly making devil horns with his hands. 'Pantera!' According to a recent poll, 59 percent of Americans vehemently demanded that guitarists rip it up on a sweet double-neck guitar, frequently switching between the two fretboards like it's nothing, while 84 percent called for an interlude midway through the solos during which another guitarist walks over and plays a cool harmony part alongside the lead. A further 73 percent said guitarists must at some point strum a really high note and simply let it ring while holding the guitar up with one hand, preferably while looking up and nodding at the crowd. Moreover, 100 percent of respondents said that the guitarist should hit the whammy bar at the end of a particularly sick riff, with all respondents agreeing that such a maneuver would 'kick ass.' 'What they should do is make the whole stage dark and then there's a big spotlight on the guitarist guy, and there's all this fog and smoke coming up around him too,' said 42-year-old Houston resident Samantha Pragle, noting that, ideally, the guitar should have some cool flames painted on it. 'And it doesn't just have to be one solo per song. A song could have a whole bunch of solos in it. Maybe the entire song could be a solo! Man, can you imagine how insane that would be? That would fucking rule!' While unanimous in their demands for more unbelievable, earsplitting solos, the American public is reportedly divided over how the solos should end. According to sources, some have pressed for several amplifiers to be wildly kicked over after the last note, though others are staunchly in favor of seeing the soloist use his guitar strap to throw his instrument around his body, catch it, and then seamlessly transition into playing the song's final chorus. 'I love guitar solos! I like when they play the guitar behind their head, just like this!' said Philadelphia accountant Alan Hurley, 57, closing his eyes and rapidly moving his fingers across an imaginary fretboard while making guitar sounds with his mouth. 'Wa-na-na, neeow, wa-na, wa-now!' 'Wa-na-na-na,' Hurley added. 'Na-na-neeow, wah-a-wow!' At press time, tens of millions of enthusiastic Americans had reportedly cued up a YouTube video of Steve Vai's 'For The Love Of God' and cranked it all the way up.","entertainment, music, our annual year 2014, news, vol 50 issue 11, entertainment"

994,True Detective' Fan Develops Elaborate Theory He Will Be Let Down By Season Finale,"LANSING, MI'Claiming that the clues have been in plain sight all along, local man and diehard True Detective fan Spencer Adams, 34, told reporters Friday he has developed an elaborate theory that he will be incredibly disappointed by the show's upcoming season finale. 'If you've been paying close attention to each episode so far, everything points to the fact that we're headed for a huge disappointment this Sunday,' said Adams, citing as supporting evidence the impossibly high expectations scattered throughout the crime drama's first seven episodes and listing off a labyrinthine catalog of loose ends and unresolved plot threads that, according to his hypothesis, the HBO series cannot possibly wrap up in the season's final 60 minutes. 'I've been watching every shot, every cutaway intently'sometimes viewing the same episodes three or four times each'and the signs are all there: the increasingly convoluted story, the massive amounts of filler in the more recent episodes, the numerous occult references that we clearly aren't going to get a proper explanation for. All of that makes a satisfying ending virtually impossible, and if you've carefully followed every onscreen moment like I have, you'll see they've been making that obvious from the very start.' Adams also noted that the show has been dropping numerous hints as to the arc of its planned second season, namely that the producers will be unable to cast leads on par with Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson and that Adams will then stop watching.","entertainment, television, news in brief, vol 50 issue 09, entertainment"

997,Francis Ford Coppola Reveals Every 'Godfather' Film Took Place In Same Narrative World,"LOS ANGELES'Saying that he always intended for the films' events to fit into a single linear timeline, director Francis Ford Coppola revealed in an interview this week that The Godfather, The Godfather Part II, and The Godfather Part III all took place within the same narrative universe. The 74-year-old auteur explained that although each film can be appreciated as a stand-alone project, he in fact directed the movies with the conscious goal of weaving all three together into one cohesive world, dropping in subtle clues throughout to suggest that certain details and even entire story arcs within the movies were connected. 'Observant fans sometimes point out that a character named Michael Corleone appears in all three movies and that he's played by Al Pacino each time, and I can assure you that's no coincidence,' said Coppola, who noted that 'all the puzzle pieces are there' for anyone who looks hard enough at the three motion pictures. 'In fact, those aren't three different people, but rather one character who appears three times. Michael in New York in the first film, Michael in Lake Tahoe in the second one, then Michael back in Manhattan in the third'they're the very same man.' 'I did a similar thing having Carlo's death in The Godfather carry over into the next two films,' Coppola continued. 'You'll notice he doesn't show up in any of the others. That's because he's still dead in this one continuous storyline. Meanwhile, Connie is his widow, which is me kind of winking at the opening wedding scene with her and Carlo from the first film. It's subtle, but once you pick up on a detail like this, you'll start to notice many other little connections.' Coppola said that once he conceived of the idea of placing the movies in the same universe, he made a point of theatrically hinting at the web of intersections between all three. In addition to keeping the same characters from movie to movie, Coppola noted that viewers who pay close attention can catch other continuities among the three works, from the music playing in the background, to common phrases and manners of speech, right down to the titles of the films themselves. Indeed, rather than viewing them as separate tales of organized crime in America, Coppola said he would prefer that people instead consider The Godfather, The Godfather Part II, and The Godfather Part III as a unified trilogy, or saga, portraying the story of a single Mafia family over time. Over the entire course of production, however, Coppola admitted that keeping the single interconnected world consistent became more of a challenge, especially in the third film'which he said was meant to be the 'final' movie in the Godfather universe, temporally speaking'as it required viewers to make the complex logical leap of recognizing that the crime family depicted in the late 1970s was still the same crime family from the 1940s and 1950s from the earlier films. 'Basically, all the people with the last name Corleone who appear in the films are supposed to be related to each other,' said Coppola, recalling how during production he actually took the time to painstakingly map out the entire fictitious Corleone family tree that runs through all three projects. 'For instance, Santino Jr. from the third film is the grandson of Vito from the first film, played by Marlon Brando, who is meant to be an older version of Robert de Niro's character of Vito Corleone from the second film. It sounds confusing, but believe me, this is something we actually planned out.' 'For example, if you pay close attention, Marlon and Robert never appear on screen together,' he added. 'That may seem trivial at first, but then it hits you: they're playing the same person but at different ages.' Noting that the nods to a common narrative were 'Easter eggs' intended 'only for the real diehards,' Coppola emphasized that the movies still held up individually, though he assured audiences that, after several viewings, many of them would pick up on details such as the fact that almost every character in the three films has ties to the Sicilian Mafia. 'We planned the films with the big picture in mind, but we always tried not to spell it out so much that it became a gimmick, and instead left it to fans to discover the connections themselves,' the writer-director said. 'I always hoped that when people took a step back, they'd come to see how these three films sort of mesh together'how, if you want to think of it in this way, they are actually just one long story made up of three parts.' 'Fans shouldn't get too carried away, though, and look for elements of The Godfather in other movies I've worked on,' continued Coppola, confirming that the Godfather storyline is only limited to the three films with Godfather in their name. 'For example, Apocalypse Now is a film I made that's not part of the Godfather universe, which I tried to emphasize by not having Robert Duvall's character Bill Kilgore mention the Mafia'just like Tom Hagen never mentions Vietnam. I was very careful about that kind of stuff.' Coppola did note, however, that Fredo Corleone from the first Godfather and Fredo Corleone from the second were supposed to be entirely different characters, and admitted that the repeated name was an error he noticed only after the film's release.","entertainment, movies, news, vol 50 issue 09, entertainment"
998,Academy To Give Runners-Up Detailed Progress Reports Outlining Where Stars Can Improve,"LOS ANGELES'In an effort to provide personalized feedback so that all Oscar nominees can strengthen their performance habits and ensure future awards success, members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences confirmed this week that they will issue in-depth progress reports to each of this year's runners-up. 'Every nominee who does not win in his or her category can expect to sit down with Academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs for a 20-minute one-on-one to go over a three- to four-page summary of their specific dramatic strengths as well as some areas that require improvement,' said AMPAS public relations representative Rob Friedman, who added that the Academy would take all facets of an actor's performance into consideration when compiling the assessments, including effort, range, and dialogue delivery, each of which would be evaluated on a standardized five-point scale. 'Detailed, constructive evaluations are key to helping nominees develop the skills they need to thrive during the competitive awards season, and we hope that this new service will help take some of the guesswork out of what is expected of them and equip them to succeed going forward.' To help reinforce the reports' recommendations, Friedman said that each runner-up would be required to write up a brief summary of their acting goals for the upcoming year and develop an actionable plan to achieve those goals.","entertainment, celebrities, oscars, movies, news in brief, vol 50 issue 08, entertainment"

'Everything I've done over the past year'the countless hours spent poring over fashion blogs and scrutinizing celebrity gossip magazines'it's all been in preparation for this moment,' said Kohls, who, after delivering a solid criticism of Sandra Bullock's color-block Prabal Gurung dress at this year's Golden Globes, admitted she was going into tonight's awards show with confidence in her ability to mete out discerning praise or condemnation of the style choices of Hollywood's elite. 'There is so much to take into account for a proper assessment: the gown's designer, its cut, whether the fabric and color are flattering, hair, makeup, accessories, whether or not the actress is taking a risk or departing from her signature style. It's tremendous pressure, but after putting in so much time training, I think I'm ready for whatever dazzling ensembles or cringe-worthy fashion disasters come down that red carpet.' After taking a deep breath and telling reporters 'it's showtime,' Kohls was overheard inquiring whether the first actress to arrive at the Dolby Theatre realized this was the goddamn Oscars and not her junior prom.","entertainment, oscars, movies, news in brief, vol 50 issue 08, entertainment"

1012,New Blog Piece On Woody Allen To Settle Everything,"NEW YORK'Amidst the ongoing debate over the iconic director's alleged sexual abuse in 1992 of his then 7-year-old adopted daughter, numerous sources nationwide confirmed Thursday that a newly published blog post titled 'What You Really Need To Know About The Woody Allen Scandal' will finally and categorically settle the matter in its entirety. 'It's important to note that Allen was never arrested or charged for a crime, but considering Dylan Farrow's incredibly candid open letter in The New York Times and what we know of such cases, I couldn't help but ask myself: Who can we believe here?' read an excerpt from the truly essential 1,200-word online article, which, given its unique and illuminating insights into the topic and its wealth of arguments previously unconsidered by all other blog pieces on the subject, definitively answers all open questions about the 20-year-old case and effectively ends any dispute over Woody Allen's culpability, how Americans should feel about his work, and his eventual standing in the annals of American cinema. 'I am fully aware of the failures of the U.S. justice system when it comes to sexual assault victims, but I am also aware of how delicate a situation this is and how slippery a slope the presumption of innocence or guilt can be on either side. And with that in mind, let me share with you the conclusions you should take away from the whole Woody Allen saga.' At press time, upon reading the blog piece, every single citizen in the United States reportedly felt a reassuring sense of closure on all facets of the scandal and quickly took to the blog's comments section to express their full agreement with the article's thesis and congratulate the author on finally bringing the truth to light.","entertainment, celebrities, internet, news in brief, vol 50 issue 05, entertainment"

'Although some people such as Wes Anderson and Tom Berenger have met Dafoe, they amount to a tiny fragment of the larger population. For most people, Willem Dafoe just isn't someone they have met.' Among those who acknowledged never meeting Dafoe, 87 percent responded positively when asked if they were open to one day meeting the 58-year-old dramatic actor.","entertainment, celebrities, news in brief, vol 50 issue 05, entertainment"

1018,"Aaron Eckhart Likes To Make One Frankenstein Movie For Them, One Frankenstein Movie For Himself","LOS ANGELES'Saying that he has always tried to balance his workload between projects that appeal to him as an actor and those with broader commercial appeal, film star Aaron Eckhart told Hollywood reporters today that he likes to alternate between making big-budget Frankenstein movies for the broader public, and making more intimate, personal Frankenstein movies for himself. 'If you want to stay in this business for the long haul it's always going to be a balancing act, but luckily I've found a formula that works for me: I do one major studio Frankenstein movie, and then another subtler, more raw Frankenstein picture for the festival circuit,' said the 45-year old celebrity, explaining that taking the leading roles in heavily marketed Frankenstein blockbusters afforded him the freedom to 'really focus on [his] craft' and get lost in smaller, often foreign independent Frankenstein films. 'At this point in my career, would I prefer to focus solely on the more nuanced Frankenstein projects that are really meaningful to me? Sure, of course. But I can't complain. As long as I get to tell the deeper, layered Frankenstein stories I want to tell on the screen or stage, I'm happy to sign on for a flashy Frankenstein popcorn flick for the masses. It works out well.' Eckhart added that he rarely gets to make a passion project that also happens to be a big-budget studio film with four-quadrant appeal like I, Frankenstein, but when it happens, 'it's the best feeling in the world.'","entertainment, celebrities, movies, news in brief, vol 50 issue 04, entertainment"

'Wow, what an honor,' said the recipient of the statuette, an individual who sources confirmed could never create anything even remotely on par with what is indisputably the finest and most well-honed artistic statement in rock music, and, furthermore, who isn't one-tenth the songwriter that Lindsey Buckingham is. 'I just [don't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as the brilliant musicians behind Rumours, a record that since its release has captivated millions with its ingenious yet playful compositions, flawless production, and sheer emotional resonance. The Mac's 1977 masterpiece is truly without parallel, and modern-day pop acts such as myself can only dream of ever of creating anything that begins to approach its unsurpassed brilliance]. Thank you.' According to ceremony attendees, the presentation of the Best Album award followed the evening's previous announcement of the winners of Best Pop Solo Performance, Song of the Year, and Best New Artist, not one of whom wrote or played on 'You Make Loving Fun.'","grammys, entertainment, music, news in brief, vol 50 issue 03, entertainment"

'It feels great just to have my album Magna CartaEEHoly Grail nominated this year, but for it to even be mentioned in the same breath with a flawless album like Jay Z's Magna CartaEEHoly Grail is a humbling experience and one that I truly cherish.' Jay Z then told reporters that, regardless of who wins tonight's award, he knows that Jay Z is the artist who truly deserves it.","entertainment, music, news in brief, vol 50 issue 03, entertainment"

1024,Songs That Are Always On In Background Expected To Win Big At Grammys,"LOS ANGELES'With the 56th Grammy Awards just days away, industry experts are predicting that the songs that are always playing at moderate volume from ceiling-mounted speakers in retailers, gas station canopies, and mall food courts will take home the biggest awards at Sunday's ceremony. 'It is bound to be a huge night for that song that was playing in the movie theater before they started the trailers and the other one that you kind of know from when you go out to eat lunch'both are virtual locks for Grammy gold,' said L.A. Times music critic Randall Roberts, who noted that the song from that car commercial that your coworker sometimes absentmindedly hums was a also a strong contender for Record of the Year. 'Any of the songs that you've learned most of the chorus to through shopping at clothing stores or supermarkets but couldn't actually name'those are the ones you should be watching Sunday night. Basically, if you've heard a Jeep go by blaring it a couple of times in the past few months, it is almost certain to take the night's top honors.' Roberts confirmed that the songs that you turn on to drown out those in the background were not nominated.","grammys, entertainment, music, news in brief, vol 50 issue 03, entertainment"
1025,More Hollywood Celebrities Reproducing By Asexual Budding,"LOS ANGELES'With more and more celebrities sprouting exact genetic copies of themselves through a process of cellular division, the hot new trend of asexual budding has rapidly become the most popular method of reproduction in baby-crazed Tinseltown, sources said Thursday. In recent weeks, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ryan Gosling, Jennifer Aniston, and Justin Timberlake have all been seen in public with a protruding outgrowth of cells that, upon becoming mature, will reportedly detach from each A-lister's body and become a separate individual biologically identical to its parent. 'The hottest thing to be spotted with in L.A. right now is a pulsating, membranous sac containing your own budding offspring,' said Hollywood trend spotter Rachel Florio-Urso, noting that stars such as Kerry Washington, January Jones, and Shakira have fearlessly donned tight dresses that show off the incubating nodes bulging beneath the skin of their backs, arms, or necks. 'It's how all the top celebs are procreating these days.' 'And it's not just for the ladies, either,' she added. 'Jared Leto, Channing Tatum, and Robert Pattinson have also been seen sporting buds recently.' In addition, Florio-Urso said, Daniel Craig was spotted last week at a cozy trattoria in West Hollywood with a miniaturized clone of himself presumed to be his budded progeny. While Angelina Jolie is rumored to have grown a daughter by asexual budding as far back as 2006, sources in the know said duplicating oneself by spontaneously generating a pod of one's own cells didn't really take off until recently, with the current award season marking the first time members of the Hollywood elite have openly flaunted their buds on the red carpet. 'When a bud ripped itself out of a mucus-covered node on Leonardo DiCaprio's chest right there at the Golden Globes, and a tiny nude, shivering replica of Leo started scampering around the Beverly Hilton, boom, that was it: instant gotta-have-it trend,' entertainment news editor Bonnie Fuller said. 'His bump had been the subject of tabloid speculation for weeks, and when it turned translucent and burst right there on Ryan Seacrest's shoes, everyone's question was answered.' 'Was he the first star to reproduce without the fusion of gametes?' she continued. 'No, but still, Leo was huge.' Fuller went on to speculate that displaying the scar tissue that forms once a bud falls off may soon become popular too: She said to 'forget Birkin bags and Louboutins' and 'start looking for the pocked, dented area where fibrous tissue has replaced the cells on a celebrity's shoulder or cheekbone.' With high-profile buddings now dominating the coverage of talk shows and celebrity magazines, reports confirmed the trend of asexual reproduction has started spreading far beyond Hollywood. 'As soon as I saw that Amy Adams was budding, I wanted to bud too,' said Maryland resident Erica Katz, who since last month has sprouted three polyps that will soon generate three independent beings that share her exact DNA. 'She's such a class act, and I've always admired her style.' Some critics have expressed worry over the trend, however. Noting that Jake Gyllenhaal currently has five blossoming nodes lining his torso, many have asked what will happen when each of those five buds detaches and grows five buds of its own. According to estimates, this exponential replication of buds from other buds could result in more than 14,000 Jake Gyllenhaals coming into existence by 2016. But Hollywood insiders have claimed these concerns are overblown, arguing that budding won't be around any longer than sporogenesis, the fad of releasing a unicellular body from open-capped puffballs or spore-bearing gills that stars like Drew Barrymore, Chris O'Donnell, and Gwen Stefani glamorized in the 1990s.","entertainment, celebrities, kids, sex, news, vol 50 issue 03, entertainment"
1026,Woman Takes Short Half-Hour Break From Being Feminist To Enjoy TV Show,"PORTLAND, OR'Saying that she just wanted a little time to relax and 'not even think about' confining gender stereotypes, local health care industry consultant Natalie Jenkins reportedly took a 30-minute break from being a feminist last night to kick back and enjoy a television program. Jenkins, 29, told reporters that after a long and tiring day at her office, all she wanted to do was return home, sit down on her couch, turn on an episode of the TLC reality show Say Yes To The Dress, and treat herself to a brief half hour in which she could look past all the various and near constant ways popular culture undermines the progress of women. 'Every once in a while, it's nice to watch a little television without worrying about how frequently the mainstream media perpetuates traditional gender roles,' Jenkins said before putting her feet up on her coffee table and tuning in to the popular program that follows women as they shop for wedding gowns. 'No mentally cataloging all the times women are subtly mocked or shamed for not living up to an unrealistic body image, no examining how women are depicted as superficial and irrationally emotional, and no thinking about how these shows reinforce the belief that women should simply aspire to find a man and get married'none of that. Not tonight. I'm just watching an episode of Say Yes To The Dress and enjoying it for what it is.' 'Between 9 and 9:30, I'm not even going to take notice of all the two-dimensional portrayals of women as fashion- and shopping-obsessed prima donnas,' Jenkins added. 'That part of my brain will just be switched off.' Jenkins confirmed that she watched contentedly for the entirety of the television program, telling reporters that she never once allowed herself to grow indignant as the adult, employed, and presumably self-respecting women on screen repeatedly demanded to be made into 'princesses.' Additionally, Jenkins acknowledged that she witnessed dozens of moments in which the brides-to-be abandoned the notion that they should be valued for their personalities and intellects and instead seemed to derive their sole sense of worth from embellishing their appearance. However, she said she was able to consistently remind herself that this was 'Natalie time' and that the feminist movement 'could do without [her] for 30 minutes.' 'Normally, I'd be pretty irritated at the thought of millions of people across the country mindlessly watching such a backward representation of what it means to be a woman in the 21st century, but tonight I'm just unwinding and not letting it get to me,' Jenkins said. 'It's actually been kind of nice to push all the insinuations that marriage is the one true path for women to achieve happiness and fulfillment to the back of my mind and just lie back and have a good time.' 'In fact, there was a part where one of the brides threw a tantrum because the dress she wanted was above her budget and then whined to her father until he finally gave in and bought it for her, and I just let myself laugh out loud,' added Jenkins, noting that, while she was fully aware that such depictions reinforced the notion of women as helpless figures who require a man to provide for them, she was 'letting all that stuff slide' during this particular half hour. 'This show's actually pretty fun and entertaining if you ignore how damaging it could be to our perceptions of gender in society.' Jenkins also reportedly viewed roughly 10 minutes of advertisements throughout the show, during which time she reminded herself to actively tune out the numerous instances wherein feminine sexuality was used to sell products; the number of times advertisements preyed on female insecurity; and the sheer volume of bare female skin shown on screen. 'Sure, I just watched several commercials that basically reduced women to explicitly sexualized objects whose sole purpose is to please men, but someone else can worry about that right now because I'm off the clock,' said Jenkins, following a succession of ads for vodka, shampoo, and the Fiat 500. 'Honestly, I don't even care that that yogurt commercial showed thin, beautiful women easily balancing home and work lives while eating 60-calorie packs of yogurt. Tonight, in my mind, they're just selling Greek yogurt. That's all.' While affirming that she had fully recommitted herself to the cause of gender equality as soon as the show's credits ended, Jenkins admitted she was already looking forward to the next time she could let herself disregard the many ways women are reduced to stale caricatures on national television. 'Honestly, it's pretty exhausting to call out every sexist stereotype or instance of misogyny in popular culture, so sometimes I have to just throw my hands up and grant myself a little time off,' Jenkins said. 'And given the state of modern media, momentarily suspending my feminist ideals is the only way to get through a night of TV without becoming totally livid or discouraged.' As of press time, Jenkins' sense of relaxation and contentment had been entirely undone by the first 30 seconds of 2 Broke Girls.","entertainment, our annual year 2014, women, news, vol 50 issue 03, entertainment"
1027,"12 Years A Slave,' 'Captain Phillips,' 'American Hustle,' 'Wolf Of Wall Street,' 'Blue Jasmine,' 'Dallas Buyers Club,' 'Her,' 'Nebraska,' 'Before Midnight,' And 'Philomena' All Written During Same Continuing Education Screenwriting Class","LOS ANGELES'Days after they were announced as the 10 nominees for Best Original Screenplay and Best Adapted Screenplay at the upcoming Academy Awards ceremony, sources revealed Tuesday that the films 12 Years A Slave, Captain Phillips, American Hustle, The Wolf Of Wall Street, Blue Jasmine, Dallas Buyers Club, Her, Nebraska, Before Midnight, and Philomena were all in fact written over the course of the same Introduction to Screenwriting for Film continuing education class. 'Thanks to our work together on narrative structure, realistic dialogue, and screenplay formatting, the students in my class managed to write some great scripts, and I'm very proud of them all,' Barton Adult Education Institute course instructor Keith Whitney told reporters, referring to enrollees in the six-week intensive script writing seminar that included students David O. Russell, Spike Jonze, and Woody Allen. 'Granted, they were a little wet behind the ears when we first started out.

1029,Report: 'Swamp Thing' And 'The Return Of Swamp Thing' Just 2 Of Literally Thousands Of Movies,"LOS ANGELES'According to a report released Wednesday by the American Film Institute, the 1982 motion picture Swamp Thing and its 1989 sequel, The Return Of Swamp Thing, are only two of literally thousands of movies in existence. The report, which describes a rich and varied cinematic history stretching from the late 19th century to the present, suggests that these two 90-minute features about a superhero who is half human and half plant constitute, in fact, only a mere fraction of all the movies ever produced, and that Swamp Thing franchise directors Wes Craven and Jim Wynorski are just two among many, many people to have made a film. 'Conventional wisdom tells us there are predominantly two movies out there: Swamp Thing, of course, and then its less popular but still well-known follow-up, The Return Of Swamp Thing,' AFI president Bob Gazzale told reporters. 'What we're finding, however, is that those two films are just the tip of the iceberg in terms of what the art of cinema has to offer.' 'And very few of these other movies, it turns out, feature what could be construed as a plant-based mutant or green humanoid vigilante as their protagonist,' Gazzale added. Using exacting methods to divide all films into the discrete categories of 'Swamp Thing related' and 'not Swamp Thing­ related,' the authors of the report concluded that the latter group is much larger than the former, with fewer than 1 percent of titles taking place in swamps or having either Swamp Thing or a similar such figure featured in them. The report went on to cite a number of movies in which actress Adrienne Barbeau does not play government agent and Swamp Thing love interest Alice Cable'and many in which Barbeau does not, in fact, appear at all'demonstrating that over the years, filmmakers and films in general have been far more prolific than the public may have realized. 'Through a careful examination of box-office records, we have shown that during the seven-year interim between the release of Swamp Thing and The Return Of Swamp Thing, there were actually hundreds of movies written and directed in Hollywood,' said Gazzale, also noting that the 1980s isn't the only decade in which films have been made. 'There are movies being shot at this very moment that don't, in any way, involve a respected scientist named Alec Holland being transformed by a freak lab accident into a benevolent swamp creature.' AFI officials stated that a frame-by-frame analysis of a random sample of films found that the overwhelming majority do not feature a plotline concerned with an army of super-soldiers genetically enhanced by plant DNA, the catchphrase 'They call meEESwamp Thing,' or an extended opening sequence set to Creedence Clearwater Revival's 'Born On The Bayou.' According to the report, most movies aren't even based on DC Comics superheroes'or on comics at all, for that matter'but exist instead within completely unrelate","entertainment, movies, news, vol 50 issue 02, entertainment"

'The door is open, circle unbroken; come to us, Oh Perfect One, and bathe us in your Light!' 59-year-old housewife Linda Weber recited amidst a sea of naked aunts and mothers, twisting and gyrating in ritual procession around the flaming pit as she invoked the hallowed presence of the Sense And Sensibility star. 'Emma sumus in fide, Matres et materterae, Emma matronas inegri, Matresque canamus!' Sources reported that as the spectral form of the BAFTA Award'winning actress began flickering in the fire, the postmenopausal horde had unanimously selected Milwaukee-area mother Karen Schweitzer to be sacrificed as a burnt offering to the Goddess of Howard's End.","entertainment, celebrities, news in brief, vol 50 issue 02, entertainment"
1032,Parents Of Adorable Baby On TV Show Most Likely Insane,"NEW YORK'According to widespread sources, the parents of the adorable baby appearing on screen in a popular television comedy right now are, in all likelihood, completely insane and unfit to care for a child. 'When you're watching it, your first thought is what a cute kid this is, and then your second thought is, holy shit, they must have taken this baby to several rounds of long 'auditions,' whatever that means for a baby, instead of letting it sleep in a crib for hours like a normal, well-adjusted infant,' said viewer Brenda Ortiz, 33, adding that it seemed safe to assume the child's parents would have to be mentally unstable to, first of all, get an agent for their baby, and second, put an innocent human being who has only been alive for a few months through weeks of callbacks and screen tests. 'I would imagine these parents probably aren't capable of taking care of themselves, let alone a 6-month-old whose well-being they've happily entrusted to an overworked TV crew.' At press time, viewers were trying to just enjoy the show and ignore the fact that this baby's parents were most likely blowing the earnings from their child's television appearance on a lavish Caribbean cruise at the expense of a college fund.","entertainment, kids, parents, news in brief, vol 50 issue 02, entertainment"

1035,Mandatory Unisex Golden Globes Uniforms Keep Focus On Stars' Work,"LOS ANGELES'Pundits from across the entertainment industry are hailing the fashion requirements put in place at last night's Golden Globes as a resounding success, agreeing that the Hollywood Foreign Press' mandate that all celebrities wear identical gray full-body unisex jumpsuits achieved the intended goal of refocusing the ceremony on the craft of acting and filmmaking. 'The spirit of the Golden Globes has always been about celebrating individuals' achievements in film and television, not their physical appearance or wardrobe, and the hundreds of required one-size-fits-all bodysuits worn last night certainly helped redirect attention to where it's due,' said E! correspondent Kristina Guerrero of the compulsory gender-neutral garments that Hollywood A-listers were obligated to wear as they filed in a straight line down the red carpet, sans makeup, at precise intervals. 'Of course, you can't deny that despite the uniforms, the stars still dazzled. I mean, whether she's wearing a custom Zac Posen gown or a woolen body covering and matte-finish Velcro sneakers, you just can't take your eyes off Amy Adams.' Fashion critics pointed out, however, that typically couture-savvy Sandra Bullock did not wear the obligatory uniform well, noting that the star's garish breast-pocket serial number distracted from her garment's boxy, shapeless waist.","golden globes, entertainment, celebrities, fashion, news in brief, vol 50 issue 02, entertainment"

'Look, there's no rhyme or reason to it, I just have this intense craving to see John Travolta in movies, on TV, joking around with reporters on the red carpet, or really doing anything'and believe me, I'm just as surprised about this as anyone,' reported Minneapolis resident Haley Morrison, 43, echoing the inexplicable desire of all 317 million Americans to hear news of the 59-year-old actor appearing soon in, say, a new Disney family comedy co-starring Marisa Tomei, as a villain in an action-thriller directed by Luc Besson, or possibly as a guest on an upcoming episode of Letterman. 'Hell, at this point, and don't ask me why, I'd settle for a People magazine interview with John Travolta discussing his love of flying and how married life with [wife] Kelly Preston is going. I mean, I guess the heart wants what it wants. I just can't believe it wants John Travolta.'

This poor bastard actually thinks he's got a shot at an Academy Award nomination,'' said an anonymous source of the heartbreakingly misguided man, who reports confirmed is so completely deluded that he genuinely believes there is 'buzz' around his performance in the film, and that all of Hollywood not only knows him, but is talking about him. 'I mean, to be so clueless and so lacking in any kind of perspective or self-awareness that you actually think the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is going to recognize your work with an Oscar nomination? I just wanted to say to him, 'What, are you nuts? That is never going to happen.' I guess Hollywood is full of people like him, though: wishers and dreamers. It's pretty sad.'

1048,New Attractive Person Comes To Nation's Attention,"LOS ANGELES'With well-groomed hair, symmetrical facial features, and appealing anatomical proportions, a new attractive person captured the nation's interest this week, joining the ranks of all others who are considered extremely good-looking and deserving of widespread attention. Reports indicate that the ideal specimen, who was first seen on a reality television program earlier this year, has already been featured in dozens of magazines and newspapers and across multiple social media platforms, where topics such as the attractive person's visits to restaurants and nightclubs, workout regimen, sense of style, and apparent lack of body fat have been discussed at length. 'I'm very excited to start paying attention to this new attractive person,' said Houston, TX resident Evan McClarain, who recently began following the attractive person on Twitter. 'There are certainly a lot of other attractive people out there, but this person is new and has a pleasing physical appearance, and I like thinking about them.' 'I can't wait to see them in more places,' he added. 'On TV, on the internet, in advertisements, and maybe later on in movies, too. ' According to sources, there has been an increasing amount of buzz around the attractive person, who, because of their similar looks and personality, has been compared to an entirely different attractive person. While some have declared themselves on Team New Attractive Person, many loyalists still consider themselves part of Team Other Attractive Person, who they claim is 'much more attractive.' Nonetheless, Americans across the country confirmed that they enjoyed discussing among friends which attractive person of the opposite gender this new attractive person might look attractive with. While the attractive person's future career plans are reportedly not determined at this time, many have expressed interest in learning what they are. 'When describing people in real life who I think are attractive, I may use this attractive person's name as a comparison,' said Petaluma, CA convenience store clerk Jen Rinaldi, who added that she plans to purchase a product that the new attractive person also owns or endorses. 'Until now, I've been using another attractive person's name for this purpose, and while they're still attractive, generally speaking, I do not perceive them as being 'new' and therefore they are not as inherently interesting to me at this particular point in time.' 'Besides, I heard the new attractive person is also a recording an album,' Rinaldi added, referencing an Instagram photo that circulated this week showing the attractive person posing in the studio with a popular musician, also attractive. 'I hope it gets released soon. I'm going to buy it and then go see them in concert when they come to my city.' According to a recent poll conducted by US Weekly, 57 percent of people 'love' the new attractive person, while 37 percent said they 'hate' the new attractive person. Furthermore, 33 percent agreed the new attractive person had 'good teeth,' 48 percent agreed they had 'good skin,' and 64 percent agreed they 'look good with or without glasses.' In a side-by-side comparison between the new attractive person and another attractive person, 72 percent said the new attractive person wore their clothes better, while 28 percent said the other attractive person wore their clothes better. 'I don't want to get my hopes up, but maybe someone will secretly take photos of the attractive person on the beach and post them online,' said Boston, MA consultant Dan Eaglemeyer. 'I am often aroused when I see them on TV, but I imagine I will be more aroused when I see them in a bathing suit.' 'To put it bluntly, I could see myself fantasizing about having sex with this person,' Eaglemeyer added.","entertainment, celebrities, news, vol 49 issue 49, entertainment"

1050,Bizarre Sci-Fi Novel Posits World Where Natives Inhabited America Before Europeans,"NEW YORK'In a riveting, if slightly far-fetched, work of alternate history that fans of science fiction are bound to enjoy, author Judith Nies' novel Native American History: A Chronology Of The Vast Achievements Of A Culture And Their Links To World Events imagines a strange fictional world where, prior to its 15th-century colonization by Europeans, North America was actually inhabited by millions of indigenous peoples. 'Numerous Paleoamerican groups inhabited vast expanses of land along modern-day Canada and the United States as early as 1400 C.E., including what would later become the Navajo, Iroquois, Cherokee, and Ojibwe peoples,' reads an excerpt from Nies' wildly bizarre science-fiction tale, positing a sweeping alternate reality in which vast tribes of 'Native Americans''each fleshed out with their own names, rich cultural backstories, and even strange foreign languages invented by the author'roamed the Americas for thousands of years before any European explorers set foot on the continent. 'These indigenous populations eventually established successful dryland farming practices, allowing for the cultivation of crops in the arid midwest and corn-based agriculture from Mesoamerica. Other tribes, however, lived as nomads, utilizing hunting and gathering methods to survive off the likes of buffalo, elk, deer, and antelope.' Sources confirmed that science-fiction fans are sure to be especially thrilled by the shocking conclusion to Nies' expansive sci-fi tale, in which settlers from Europe, upon reaching America, massacre and drastically marginalize these native inhabitants over the next several centuries.","entertainment, books, science fiction, news in brief, vol 49 issue 49, entertainment"

1061,Area Man Lacks Star Power Necessary To Carry Major Motion Picture,"CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA'Noting that the 37-year-old does not possess the looks, charisma, talent, or name recognition of a successful leading man, Hollywood insiders agreed Thursday that local account manager Dennis Kerning's star power is not sufficient to carry a major motion picture. Studio executives, talent agents, and film critics alike spoke candidly to reporters about the Plano resident and father of one, explaining that Kerning is simply not an A-list celebrity, and in order to make a film bankable and worth a studio's investment, you need an A-lister with a proven track record of hits, which sources reiterated Kerning does not have. 'Quite frankly, it's hard to imagine Dennis ever being cast in a big-budget film, let alone carrying one on his own,' Paramount Pictures executive Roger Hammond said of Kerning, who has reportedly spent his entire career in pharmaceutical marketing and enjoys his work. 'It takes someone with the whole package'the right skills, style, and sex appeal'to connect with a mass audience, and let's be honest here, Dennis Kerning has none of that.' 'And I'm sorry, I just don't think there's enough buzz around this guy to line up tens of millions of dollars in financing,' he added. 'From what I can tell, there isn't any buzz at all.' Dozens of industry experts echoed Hammond's assessment, arguing that it would be completely impossible to secure a distribution deal with wide release on the strength of the name Dennis Kerning. They also confirmed they had absolutely no reason to believe Kerning would be capable of generating attention at Sundance, Cannes, or Comic-Con, regardless of the role he played or the genre of movie he appeared in. While acknowledging that Kerning may be a great dad, a dedicated youth soccer coach, and an active member of his community, New York'based film producer Sarah Wilmington said that doesn't mean audiences are ready to go on a two-hour action-packed journey with him. 'Movies are competing with a variety of media today, and I honestly don't see people shelling out 12 bucks just to see the new Dennis Kerning flick, you know?' said Wilmington, predicting that a film with Kerning in the lead role would not perform well domestically and would fare even worse in key foreign markets like China and Japan. 'He hasn't been in a single blockbuster. Even Shia LaBeouf was cast in some supporting roles before he started playing the lead in $200 million installments of valuable franchise properties.' 'Tom Cruise, Will Smith, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Dennis Kerning'I'd say it's pretty obvious who doesn't belong on that list,' Wilmington continued. 'Let's be realistic.' Other media experts pointed to Kerning's negative ratings in focus groups, in which more than 90 percent of participants agreed with the statements 'Dennis Kerning doesn't have what it takes to be a commanding presence on screen,' 'I can't see myself taking my family or friends to a Dennis Kerning movie,' and 'I probably wouldn't even notice Dennis Kerning if he played any role in any movie.' 'If you attach the name Dennis Quaid to a picture, maybe it gets somewhere; if you attach the name Dennis Kerning, it means nothing,' said Variety columnist Walter Rubin, adding that Kerning's media profile is so low he wonders if the 37-year-old is even trying to court publicity in Hollywood. 'When people see Dennis Kerning, they don't see a movie star. They just don't.' 'Now, is it possible that Dennis could someday carry a TV show? Yeah, maybe,' Rubin continued. 'But even then, I just don't think he could make the transition from television to film.' Many high-profile directors expressed their reluctance to cast Kerning in a leading role, saying that while they could perhaps look past his lack of commitment to the film industry, they couldn't ignore his lack of star power. 'I'm in preproduction on a new movie right now, and I'm not even thinking about casting Dennis Kerning in the lead,' director Tim Burton said. 'His name hasn't once come up. This man is not on my radar. I've never had a meeting with him. I don't even know who represents him.' 'That being said, if Johnny Depp isn't available, I have no idea what I'm going to do,' Burton added.","entertainment, celebrities, movies, news with video, vol 52 issue 34, entertainment"

'Piven always had a strong cult following, but unfortunately it never found a wide enough audience long-term to make it profitable for the network,' said TV Guide's Matt Roush of the ratings-plagued show, which reportedly suffered from several time slot reshuffles, off-set problems with costar Robert Klein, and an uneven first season. 'The show got a lot of mileage out of the will they/won't they thing with Jeremy and Michelle, but once that got resolved in the fourth season, the ratings never really recovered. And once it was announced that fan favorite Cybill Shepherd, who played Piven's mother, would not be returning for another season, that was pretty much the final nail in the coffin.'

1074,Woman Builds Ironclad Case Proving Mila Kunis Looks Bad Without Makeup,"MILFORD, DE'After several months spent compiling and analyzing hundreds of magazine articles, internet slideshows, and transcripts of the television program Entertainment Tonight, area woman Erin Ward, 27, presented to her boyfriend on Monday her ironclad case proving actress Mila Kunis looks bad without makeup, sources are confirming. 'Evidence of the disparity in Ms. Kunis' attractiveness with makeup versus sans makeup dates back to 2007 at the earliest and is, as you can see, stark and irrefutable,' said Ward, gesturing to a corkboard-mounted flowchart chronicling all of Kunis' public appearances in the past five years. 'I'd like to direct your attention to Sample A, this photograph of Ms. Kunis on the red carpet of the 2012 People's Choice Awards. Now compare that to this photograph of her in a restaurant just two weeks later when she was not wearing makeup. Note the puffier eyes, the saggier cheeks, the pale complexion. Please note as well that, should further evidence be required, I have five full boxes' worth of documents supporting this very same conclusion.' Ward ended her 35-minute briefing by confirming that, sadly, her findings have thus far been persistently ignored and distorted by the mainstream media, though never disproven.","entertainment, celebrities, news in brief, vol 49 issue 44, entertainment"

1078,Eric Clapton Wows Audience With Even Slower Version Of 'Layla',"DULUTH, GA'Debuting yet another arrangement of the classic song Wednesday night, singer-guitarist Eric Clapton reportedly treated a sold-out crowd at the Gwinnett Center to an even slower, somehow mellower acoustic version of his original 1971 hit 'Layla.' 'When he played those first 45-second-long notes of the opening riff, that was when everyone recognized it as 'Layla' and just went nuts,' concertgoer Leslie Friedrich said of the 87-minute rendition, which according to listeners featured three eight-minute choruses and a half-hour jazzy piano interlude before concluding with a lengthy fadeout. 'I heard those brushed drums and glacial tempo and my jaw dropped. I was like, 'Wow, he actually managed to come up with a more lethargic and neutered acoustic jazz-blues version of 'Layla' than ever before! How did he pull it off?'' Sources confirmed Clapton followed 'Layla' up with a vigorous, electric double-time version of 'Tears In Heaven.'","entertainment, music, news in brief, vol 49 issue 43, entertainment"
1079,Report: ChicagoTheBand.com Most Visited Site On The Internet,"SAN FRANCISCO'With its massive and fiercely loyal user base, ChicagoTheBand.com'the official Internet home of the American music group Chicago'remains the most frequently visited website in the world, tech industry experts confirmed Wednesday. ChicagoTheBand.com, which features breaking news, song information, and tour dates for the nine-piece brass-inflected soft rock combo, reportedly draws upwards of 2.5 billion daily pageviews, easily making it the most popular online resource of the modern internet era. 'As far as sheer web traffic is concerned, there's only one name that matters right now, and that's ChicagoTheBand.com,' said Dave Sherfesee, president of web analytics firm Alexa, which estimated that the internet powerhouse charts more unique visitors than second-tier sites Facebook and Google combined. 'Every second of every day, tens of thousands of visitors click on one of its pages, whether it's the band's blog or its discography, and no other website can match that volume of activity. It's not even close, frankly.' 'In fact, our data indicates there are currently 1.32 million ChicagoTheBand.com message board users fervently debating whether 'Hard To Say I'm Sorry' or 'You're The Inspiration' is the band's definitive ballad,' Sherfesee continued. 'And that's just one of 200,000 active comment threads.' According to reports, ChicagoTheBand.com operates a 10,000-square-foot warehouse full of high-bandwidth servers maintained by approximately 140 full-time web developers and engineers who work in shifts to ensure uninterrupted access for the website's legions of users. Analysts stated that at any given moment, approximately 10 million individuals are reading through the biographies of such beloved band members as Robert Lamm and James Pankow, 8 million visitors are listening or relistening to the website's one-minute-and-19-second sample of the timeless rocker '25 Or 6 To 4,' and 35 million VIP members are watching an array of exclusive behind-the-scenes videos available only in the site's $19-per-year 'Premium Access' section. Additionally, ChicagoTheBand.com's online store, which offers Chicago-branded T-shirts, mugs, and mousepads, is said to draw more than 4 million customers per day and generate approximately $175 million in daily sales, a revenue stream approached only by online retail stalwart Amazon. Such impressive numbers can be attributed to the loyal, almost fanatical nature of ChicagoTheBand.com's visitors, who explained that the website plays an integral role in their day-to-day lives. 'First thing every morning I visit ChicagoTheBand.com, check my email, glance at Facebook, and then quickly head back to ChicagoTheBand.com to see if there have been any updates,' said Philadelphia resident Jessica Carville, 32, who like most Americans maintains a presence within the website's fan network, known as 'Chicago The Band Music Community.' 'I would say that between hanging out in the chat room, viewing the latest clips of the guys in the studio, or sending birthday wishes to Peter Cetera, I spend a good two hours on there every day.' 'And of course, whenever I'm away from my computer, I'm constantly checking the official ChicagoTheBand.com mobile app on my phone,' Carville added. The site's broad-based appeal reportedly cuts across age, race, class, and gender to reach every demographic group in the United States, and its advertising rates far outstrip those of would-be competitors like YouTube and Yahoo. However, executives at ChicagoTheBand.com told reporters the site's true strength lies in its formidable global reach, with citizens from all 196 countries in the world routinely flocking to the site. 'You have to realize that as users in New York and Washington check ChicagoTheBand.com one last time before turning in for the night, folks in Bucharest and Tehran are just waking up, so our traffic never slows,' said ChicagoTheBand.com president and CEO Curtis Hartley, who noted that the website is now available in more than 300 languages and regional dialects. 'It's a challenge to keep up, but we have a responsibility to reach all these people.' Members of the Grammy Award'winning band have expressed their pleasure at having found such a welcoming home on the internet. 'Yeah, I hear the website's really taking off,' trumpeter Lee Loughnane said. 'That's great. Chicago's got the best fans in the whole world, and I'm happy to see that they're working to keep the music alive.' 'And, hey, make sure to catch us at Proctor's Theatre in Schenectady next Wednesday,' Loughnane added. 'It's going to be a real good show.'","entertainment, music, internet, news, vol 49 issue 43, entertainment"

1082,Anne Hathaway Tormented By 14-Year-Old Bully,"LOS ANGELES'Calling the teen's behavior 'ruthless' and 'out of control,' Oscar-winning actress Anne Hathaway confirmed to reporters today that for the past few months she has been routinely and viciously bullied both in person and across a wide variety of social media by 14-year-old Jenny Schroeder. According to Hathaway, the 'incredibly mean' eighth-grader has targeted the Hollywood leading lady specifically with increasingly brazen acts of cruelty, including posting threatening messages on the 30-year-old's Facebook page and making numerous disparaging remarks about Hathaway's physical appearance, often uttered directly to her or within earshot of her. 'At first it was just super mean comments when she'd pass by me, like, 'Hey, loser,' but it's gotten way, way worse'it's a nightmare,' said Hathaway, adding that Schroeder is currently waging a war against Hathaway on social media sites Formspring.me, The Dirty, Kik, and Askfm, where the girl's messages ranged from mocking the actress' outfits to encouraging her to take her own life. 'She sends me notes and stuff telling me that my boobs are weird and that boys think I'm ugly and gross. I try to shut it out, but it's just relentless.' 'And all of her friends have gotten in on it too,' added Hathaway, wiping tears from her eyes. 'I try to avoid them, but they're always around. They're awful. I can hear them laughing at me wherever I go.' According to sources, the cyberbullying directed at Hathaway has been particularly vicious, with posts reading, 'Kill yourself,' 'Die die die, why don't u die people hate u,' 'Do you think you look good with short hair because you definitely don't, you look like a slutty elf,' 'u r a special needs actress,' and 'u got an oscar for being the 1st overweight transvestite actress with AIDS.' Friends and family recently confirmed to reporters that the bullied Hathaway began cutting and burning herself as a coping mechanism for stress on the set of the Christopher Nolan film Interstellar, and aides close to the actress fear her self-destructive behavior has expanded to include anorexia and a dangerous laxative addiction. As Hathaway appeared to deteriorate from the constant stream of digital abuse, her mother threatened to call Jenny Schroeder's parents, but Hathaway reportedly begged her to stay out of the issue. 'She just started crying hysterically and screamed, 'No, Mom'you can't call [Schroeder's] mom, it'll just make things worse!'' said Hathaway's mother, adding that she was alarmed and saddened to discover that her daughter had recently conducted Google searches for 'Is Anne Hathaway the biggest loser in the world,' 'What is overweight for a 30-year-old girl,' and 'How much Tylenol do you have to take to die' on her mother's computer. 'This Jenny girl thinks it's funny and that she's just having fun, but what she's doing to my daughter is wrong.' 'We are all trying to support Anne'her dad and I, her friends, her costars, her agent'but it's been really hard,' she said. 'I try to tell her, 'You're better than Jenny Schroeder,' but I just don't think anything's getting through.' While numerous people have posted support for Hathaway on Facebook and Twitter, telling her to 'remain brave' and 'stay strong,' reports confirmed that just as many have joined Hathaway's tormentor in levying cruel insults against the actress. 'Ha ha you're a dumb, ugly lesbo, Jenny's right,' read a recent tweet directed at Hathaway by Twitter user @channingtatum. 'Fuk off and die.'","entertainment, celebrities, news, vol 49 issue 43, entertainment"

1086,Bruce Willis Seriously Considering Doing More Films,"I've Been In Many Movies, But I'm Willing To Appear In More,' Says Willis LOS ANGELES'Saying he hadn't ruled anything out with regards to his next career move, 58-year-old actor Bruce Willis announced this week that he was strongly considering the possibility of starring in more feature films. Willis, whose long list of screen credits includes Pulp Fiction and The Sixth Sense, told reporters that while he had appeared in numerous movies already, he was still very much open to the idea of perhaps appearing in more movies, possibly even ones that fall under the genre of action or action-adventure. 'For the last 30 years I've made my living acting in movies, and now, going forward, I have to say I'm leaning toward continuing to do so,' Willis said on Monday, explaining that if he had to think about what line of work he is most suited for at this stage in his life and career, he would most likely say acting in Hollywood films. 'When I finished making my last feature film, I was faced with the decision of what to do next. I mulled it over for a few days, and then I called my agent and said, 'I think I would like to appear in another feature film.' And he said, 'Okay.'' 'Nothing is set in stone, of course, but at this point I'm fairly sure that I'm going to look at more acting opportunities, preferably in motion pictures,' Willis added. Emphasizing that he hasn't 'pulled the trigger yet' on any new projects but is currently exploring several opportunities in the film industry, Willis told reporters that he is particularly attracted to the notion of working on big-budget blockbusters produced by major motion picture studios. The actor noted that while he would definitely entertain offers to star in a suspense or science-fiction film, he would also be willing to consider dramatic or comedic roles as well. Willis said he also would be very open to the idea of reprising roles from previous films, such as his character from his recent action-comedy film Red, or possibly his character John McClane from the Die Hard film franchise. In addition, Willis told reporters he would consider taking on roles in a new ensemble comedy or a drama, genres in which he reportedly has some experience. Willis added that he is especially drawn to the possibility of starring in a major motion picture in which he is the top-billed star and the film is marketed as a 'Bruce Willis movie.' 'My agent and I went over the various options for me, and we both decided after long and careful deliberations that, given my interests and prior experience, starring in a Hollywood movie was probably the next logical step for me in my career,' Willis told reporters, noting that when he started to mentally map the next few years of his life, he could strongly visualize one or more movies being part of that future. 'In other words, if a film studio approached me tomorrow about perhaps starring in another movie, I would probably say, 'Yes, I would like to be in another movie now.'' Noting that he already has made many motion pictures in the past, Willis said that his decision to consider pursuing more opportunities in film was informed by a number of factors. In addition to his longtime interest in screen acting dating back to the early 1980s and 1990s, when he appeared in several television shows and many blockbuster films, Willis said that acting in more movies not only provides an outlet for his creative energies, but also makes sense financially. 'I thought about what job I could get paid the most money for doing right now, and I eventually concluded that starring in a Hollywood movie would probably pay the most,' the actor said of his inclination to continue in the film industry, explaining that he typically earns tens of millions of dollars per motion picture in addition to perks like free airfare and promotional products. 'My wife put it best the other day: I'm 58 years old, I've acted in dozens of films, and I've made over $150 million on movies. So now I could either retire, go in a different career direction, or I could continue making movies.' 'It's a tough choice, but I can see how making another movie might be the way to go,' Willis continued. 'And then, after that, I guess I would consider maybe acting in another movie.' Willis said that over the next few weeks, he'll continue to discuss the issue with his family, meet with agents, wrap up his current movie projects, and mull things over before officially announcing his next move. 'I'm honestly not sure what the future holds, but one thing I do know is that it probably involves acting in more movies,' Willis added. 'But I don't know, maybe I'm overthinking this.'","entertainment, celebrities, movies, news, vol 49 issue 42, entertainment"

'I figure until we get a sound bite from every single person who worked with Cory Monteith on Glee, exhaust every possible image of him for retrospective slideshows, publish a separate post for every new tribute video, and report every minute detail of every single autopsy report, then there's still a good bit of water at the bottom of this well,' said Starpulse.com editor John DiMico, just one of many internet content producers who sources said can definitely get a good five or six more miles out of this gas tank if they aggregate some stories about the emotional state of Monteith's girlfriend, Lea Michele, and bang out a few more posts on the dangers of mixing drugs and alcohol.

'Even though we were only married for a few years, Frank was the love of my life, and the truth is I never really split up with him, or, for that matter, Dudley Moore, Kurt Russell, Walter Cronkite, Richard Gere, Gore Vidal, Oliver Stone, Bob Costas, Burt Bacharach, or Prince,' the 68-year-old actress and humanitarian told reporters, noting that while she was seriously involved with Allen from 1980 until 1992, she still 'had never really forgotten' former flames Henry Rollins, John Malkovich, Michael Dukakis, Huey Lewis, Paul Newman, and Bill Laimbeer. 'But then, of course, about a year before [Ronan was born], I had also recently reconnected with 'Pistol' Pete Maravich, Mikhail Gorbachev, Michael Landon, David Lynch, Jim Henson, Prince Charles, O.J.

1105,Breaking Bad' Ends With Reveal That Whole Series Was Plot Of Book Marie Shoplifted,"LOS ANGELES'Capping off five seasons of critically acclaimed television, the AMC series Breaking Bad concluded its run Sunday night with the shocking revelation that the entirety of the show's story'from Walter White's diagnosis with cancer to his transformation into a ruthless methamphetamine kingpin'was in fact merely the plotline of a crime novel that character Marie Schrader had shoplifted from a local bookstore. 'What I wanted to create for the finale was an uncompromising conclusion focused on the show's true emotional core: Marie's kleptomania,' show creator Vince Gilligan said of the episode's revelatory last scene, in which flashbacks to beloved moments from the show are intercut with shots of Marie flipping to chapters in the novel such as 'Heisenberg's New Hat,' 'Trouble With Gus,' and 'The Train Robbery.' 'From day one of writing the show, I knew exactly how the story would play out: with virtually all of its central characters other than Marie'including Walter White, Jesse Pinkman, Saul Goodman, everyone'revealed to be fictitious figures in a paperback thriller Marie felt compelled to slip into her jacket in an Albuquerque-area Barnes & Noble. Marie uses this pulp crime novel to help herself deal with the guilt she has stemming from her own very real criminal behavior, which she tries desperately to hide from her husband, local mineralogist Hank Schrader.' Gilligan told reporters he is especially pleased with the final shot of the series, in which Marie closes the stolen book, revealing it had been titled Breaking Bad all along.","entertainment, news in brief, vol 49 issue 39, entertainment"

Reports indicate that the media company has already approached director Sam Mendes to create an original drama series based on the life of Al Capone solely for Netflix Gas.","entertainment, news in brief, vol 49 issue 39, netflix, entertainment"

'The narrative is dynamic and multilayered, the characterizations are brilliantly assured, and the vast open-world experience creates a style of play that is both revolutionary in design and intellectually stimulating,' Mitchell told reporters, moments before making his in-game character block traffic with a bus to create a 10-car pileup in the middle of the street, toss grenades at unsuspecting pedestrians while standing on top of an ambulance, and jump off a building into the spinning blades of a helicopter. 'And nowhere is GTA V more groundbreaking than when it is deftly skewering the vices and follies of contemporary culture with its razor-sharp social commentary.' At press time, Mitchell was remarking on the game's 'stunningly inventive storycraft' while repeatedly kicking a Los Santos resident until blood pooled around their lifeless body.","entertainment, video games, news in brief, vol 49 issue 38, entertainment"

'Fans of gothic melodrama and classic Americana have their pick of the litter tonight, but only time will tell if they flock to the gritty realism of David Milch's Ichabod or TNT's sci-fi depiction of Sleepy Hollow as a futuristic, crime-ridden metropolis,' said Los Angeles Times television critic Mary McNamara of the litany of shows that all followed last year's release of the BBC drama Mr. Crane. 'On the other hand, many viewers could find themselves drawn to Showtime's Cloaked Rider, starring Toni Collette as the first-ever female Headless Horseman. Only time will tell which show will come out on top.' McNamara noted that all four shows could lose a significant amount of viewers to NBC's Young Van Winkle, debuting tonight in the same time slot.","entertainment, television, news in brief, vol 49 issue 38, entertainment"

1118,"Completely Unrealistic TV Character Has Complex, Multifaceted Personality","NEW YORK'According to a number of prominent television critics nationwide, the HBO series Boardwalk Empire stretches belief to the breaking point by featuring an incredibly implausible main character who is a complex human being with a layered, ambiguous, and nuanced personality. 'I honestly want to like Nucky, the main character, but it's frankly really hard to swallow this super unrealistic fantasy universe where human beings act with purpose, have complicated thoughts and opinions, are motivated by coherent desires, and are more than just superficial, mindless stereotypes,' wrote Washington Post TV critic Hank Stuever in a recent column, adding that while individuals in the real world drift thoughtlessly through their entire unexamined lives, the show's incredibly far-fetched protagonist seemed to have a deep inner life, an actual original point of view, and a sense of moral conflict. 'The whole premise that there are people out there with a full, expressive range of emotions, and a worldview that is willing to see things in more shades than simply black and white, is just completely preposterous. I mean, do the writers seriously expect us to buy this nonsense?' Stuever conceded, however, that he found the show's depiction of a bleak, inhospitable universe 'just about right on the money.'","entertainment, news, tv, news in brief, vol 49 issue 37, entertainment"

1121,Billboard Alerts Drivers To Existence Of Situational Comedy Starring Stand-Up Comedian Jerry Seinfeld,"CHICAGO'City commuters reported a mixture of surprise and excitement this weekend after passing a billboard informing them of the existence of a situational comedy titled Seinfeld, which evidently stars stand-up comedian Jerry Seinfeld. According to the billboard, the program, which many commuters speculate could be based on the observational comedy of Jerry Seinfeld, would air back-to-back episodes on weeknights at 9 and 9:30 p.m. 'Jerry Seinfeld, the comedian? He has a television program?' asked driver Laura Galloway, 49, after first seeing the 14-by-48-foot sign that reportedly depicts Seinfeld with a somewhat cocksure facial expression that also seems to suggest, 'Come on, people.' 'I would have never known that Jerry Seinfeld had his own episodic comedy series had I not seen that billboard.' 'I hope the show is a success,' she added. Commuters told reporters that based on the button-down shirt and sweater vest the comedian is wearing in the advertisement, it appears as if Seinfeld takes place in the 1990s, and that the program will be centered around a Jerry Seinfeld'like character. Sources speculated that while it is fairly clear'based on the way Seinfeld is crossing his arms'that the show is a comedy program, the billboard didn't make it entirely apparent what Seinfeld's occupation would be. Various commuters said that his job could be anything from a wisecracking attorney, to a newlywed, to a stand-up comedian, or a shop owner of some kind. Commuters also said it was unclear from the billboard if Jerry Seinfeld's name in the television series would be Jerry Seinfeld or if the stand-up would have a different first name altogether, like Mark or Eric. 'Now that I know when it's on, I am definitely going to watch the show,' Mark Posniak, 37, told reporters, adding that this is the first time he has ever heard of a television program called Seinfeld. 'But back-to-back episodes five days a week? That's 10 episodes every five days. I just hope he doesn't get burnt out.' 'He looks great though,' Posniak said, referring to the image of Seinfeld. 'It's like he hasn't aged a day. He's got a full head of hair and looks full of energy. I guess I would be too if I was just given my own television program.' Sources nationwide confirmed that the Chicago-area billboard is just one of many advertisements for the Seinfeld-inspired situational comedy. A second version of the advertisement, seen in many cities throughout the country, reportedly features Seinfeld pictured with a bespectacled, balding man, a dark-haired woman, and a second taller and more frazzled-looking man, all of whom are hugging one another, leading many to conclude that these individuals are also characters in the show and may be part of Jerry Seinfeld's fictional family, the Seinfelds. The presumed existence of a cast prompted many onlookers to abandon their previously held belief that Seinfeld was actually a talk show hosted by Jerry Seinfeld. A third sign, which shows a wild-eyed Seinfeld clutching his hair with both hands, fueled speculation amongst many drivers that the show's comedy would be broad, zany, and feature the Jerry Seinfeld character dealing with numerous madcap complications that frazzle him. 'It seems like there is a lot of marketing for Seinfeld, so I bet a lot of people will watch it,' Ben Reynolds, 34, told reporters. 'Good for him, ya know? A guy like that, who's stuck around so long, finally getting a show. That's very cool.' As of press time, commuters in cities throughout the country were also scrambling to learn more about another new television program entitled King Of Queens, which seems to be about a stocky delivery man and, according to numerous billboards, is also adopting the same grueling five-night, 10-shows-a-week production schedule.","entertainment, celebrities, news, vol 49 issue 37, entertainment"

1126,New 'RoboCop' Trailer Reveals Main Character To Be Some Sort Of Robotic Policeman,"LOS ANGELES'According to sources, a new trailer released Thursday for the upcoming film RoboCop revealed that the movie's main character seems to be some kind of futuristic robotic policeman or law enforcement officer. 'The film'and I could be wrong'seems to posit a narrative world in which a half-machine, half-man is apparently an active member of the police force and is charged with upholding the law as though he were a human member of the police force,' said 32-year-old Macon, GA resident Jeffrey Albertson, adding that while the trailer was somewhat ambiguous, he believes RoboCop will, by and large, focus primarily on the actions of a singular robotic cop and not a police force comprised of many robotic cops. 'I would assume, based on what I've seen, that because he is a robot policeman, if you will, and because he has the benefits of robotic technology, he will therefore be carrying out some of the film's more difficult police missions. Again, this is purely conjecture at this point.' Albertson said he would just have to wait for the movie to come out to see if the human and robotic elements of the character's identity come into conflict with one another, especially during the film's quieter, more emotional scenes.","entertainment, movies, news in brief, vol 49 issue 36, entertainment"

'When they call the Third Reich 'brutal' and then play that sinister music in the background, you start to wonder if the filmmakers may have come to this project with a certain agenda already in mind,' said Mike Kuldell, 43, explaining that the documentary had 'a pretty clear Allied slant' to it. 'Any pretense of objectivity is out the window by the time they start talking about the 'Nazi menace' and how Hitler's speeches were 'full of hate.' It's so heavy-handed. Why can't they just lay out the facts and let me draw my own conclusions?' Sources confirmed that by its end, Total War had devolved into a shameless hit piece that actually seemed to take a kind of sadistic pleasure in Hitler's demise.","entertainment, war, history, news in brief, vol 49 issue 36, entertainment"

'I mean, he's a big fan, and the money's good, so it's a close call, ya know?' Springsteen reportedly said of the upcoming gig, in which the 63-year-old musician would be expected to play a 45-minute set with the The E Street Band at the Presidential Palace before al-Assad, his family, and several high-ranking military officers. 'Besides, I kind of accepted over the phone when he asked, so the rest of the band is already over there right now. It sucks, but it might be the kind of thing where you just have to grit your teeth, go out there, and get it over with. Will it be my finest moment? No, but 200 grand is 200 grand.' Springsteen added that if he does ultimately decide to play the party, he's thinking of opening with 'Badlands' into 'The Ties That Bind' and then closing with an extended jam on 'Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out.'","entertainment, music, syria, news in brief, vol 49 issue 36, entertainment"

1134,Chuck Klosterman Corners Guy At Party Wearing Dio Shirt,"NEW YORK'Author Chuck Klosterman reportedly cornered a guy who was wearing a Dio shirt at a party Thursday evening and dominated an exhaustive discussion on the metal band, addressing the group's fantasy themes, deconstructing lyrics, and expounding a variety of related and semi-related topics. According to several eyewitness accounts, Klosterman encountered the party guest in a black T-shirt emblazoned with the Dio logo at approximately 9:30 p.m., walked directly over to the man, and immediately launched into a treatise on how the band's 1983 debut release Holy Diver represented the purest manifestation of heavy metal music, 'or, at least, our collective idea of what heavy metal music means.' 'Hey, man, it's interesting that you're wearing that,' Klosterman was overheard saying as he darted toward the man. 'When Dio put out Holy Diver it really filled a void left by the band's contemporaries Motörhead and Judas Priest, and yet there's a sly sense of almost half-parody coursing through the record, too, where it's almost saying 'This is a record that knows what you expect of it, and is willing to both satisfy and subvert those expectations.'' 'And yet, with its expert power riffs and and its sense, lyrically, of overcoming Stygian forces, it also completely rocks, and thus sort of fulfills its raison d'être,' added the 42-year-old author. Klosterman, who reportedly never introduced himself or asked for the man's name, reflected on the 'winking aggression' of Ronnie James Dio's lyrics, which he acknowledged were emblematic of an escapist realm that reflected the needs and desires of a largely working-class fan base. Though the man reportedly thought the conversation had concluded after 45 minutes, Klosterman moved closer, blocked him from leaving with his body, and started to talk at length about Dio's bassists Jimmy Bain, Teddy Cook, Jeff Pilson, Larry Dennison, and Rudy Sarzo, and how the band's shifting lineup 'only further emphasized what remained constant' about the group. 'Now, of course it's easy to recognize Jimmy Bain's influence on Holy Diver, The Last In Line, Sacred Heart, Dream Evil, Magica, and Killing The Dragons, even as he's being subsumed into a concept that is, if we're being honest, larger than his own skill set,' Klosterman said to the man who appeared to desperately search the room for help. 'But Jeff Pilson, who came from Dokken, may have had an even more significant impact on the band's sound while recording Strange Highways, Angry Machines, and Master Of The Moon, in that I think you can actually hear him actively fighting against the group's core identity in a way that creates tension.' 'It's also interesting that Rudy Sarzo has a Black Sabbath connection since he had previously played in Ozzy Osbourne's solo act,' added Klosterman. 'In a way, he has the most impressive metal pedigree of all the bassists, if you also consider his work with Quiet Riot and Whitesnake.' The man, who did not speak one word during the entire exchange, reportedly purchased the Dio shirt at a thrift shop. Sources confirmed that Klosterman continued to invade the personal space of the man who tried to look away but was unable to escape the columnist's ceaseless monologue, which swiftly hit on subjects such as the symbolic elements of Dio's stage show, the significance, and 'narrative continuity,' of recruiting former members of the groups Black Sabbath, Rainbow, and Sweet Savage, an obscure Canadian teen television drama, a road trip he took in the summer of 1995, and the inherent comic dualism of the Dio logo, which is Italian for 'God' and spells out the word 'devil' when viewed upside down. 'Perhaps what's most intriguing is how the band's persona and mythos essentially depicts a rock god, whether or not that distinction was earned,' Klosterman reportedly told the man who nodded, then tried to walk away, but was followed by the essayist. 'Part of the reason I find the group so fascinating is that Dio's career was peaking at roughly the same time as Sylvester Stallone's, who had just co-written and starred in the smash-hit First Blood. I don't believe that it would be arbitrary to include Arnold Schwarzenegger in this discussion, considering he had just achieved worldwide fame with his role in the film Conan The Barbarian. It's interesting; all of those artists were sort of toying with, or rebranding in a sense, our own popular sense of machismo. It's also probably worth mentioning that the animated series He-Man And The Masters Of The Universe had gone into syndication during this period as well. And in that sense, the muscular riffs and bravado of Dio's brand of fantasy-infused metal are sort of right in step with the zeitgeist of the early 1980s, during which we saw our cultural heroes striking full masculine poses in the shadow of the Cold War. We must ask ourselves: What was the affection for the action hero'be it in cinema, television, or music'at the time? Why did we long for the archetype, and why, to a certain extent, do we still long for that archetype? How is 'macho,' as a cultural signifier, being defined? How is it being confined? These larger-than-life and over-the-top heroes were boarding on cartoonish. And in that vein, Dio does verge on parody. But is it genuinely a knowing parody? Oh, man, I'm going to go grab a fresh drink. Let's continue this conversation in a minute.' Eyewitnesses told reporters that the man promptly fled the party, pushing several guests out of his way while frantically attempting to exit the apartment.","entertainment, news, vol 49 issue 34, entertainment"

1143,David McCullough Wondering How Much Scratch He Could Shake Out Of Frederick Douglass,"BOSTON'Saying that he's been 'wondering how much cheddar he could squeeze out of Old Man Abolitionist for a while now,' renowned historian David McCullough told reporters Friday that he's strongly considering writing a biography of the famed social reformer and statesman Frederick Douglass. The 80-year-old Pulitzer Prize'winning author, widely hailed as the country's preeminent historian for his biographies of American presidents and historical nonfiction works such as 1776 and The Johnstown Flood, revealed his recent interest in 'scaring up some of that sweet paper' out of Douglass 'like [he] did with the Founding Fathers gravy train.' 'I'm really starting to think about how I could rattle a few clams out of Frederick Douglass' life story,' McCullough said, noting that 'the well's certainly been tapped before, but I doubt that baby's dry.' 'Freddy D always sells, but when you consider the fact that we've got a black guy in office right now, you're looking at a zeitgeist factor that could spell some serious cabbage.' 'It's not like John Adams hadn't been covered, and I rode him like a rodeo straight to the bank,' McCullough added. 'Made some major moolah.' McCullough, who confirmed he's been researching subjects for his next book ever since he hit pay dirt with The Greater Journey, said that it wasn't until he came across an article about a meeting between the legendary slave-turned-statesman and President Abraham Lincoln that he finally thought, 'Cha-ching!' Noting that the most difficult part of beginning a new book project is settling on the right horse to ride all the way to the goddamned bank, McCullough said that since he's decided to explore Douglass' life, all that he has left to do is 'construct an engrossing narrative, throw in a couple of demonstrative anecdotes from his childhood, then sit back and watch the dough roll in.' 'I wrung Roosevelt dry, then stacked paper like a madman with Adams and Truman,' said the Presidential Medal of Freedom winner, adding that he 'pretty much shook all the founding fathers by their ankles and raked in some big-time dinero.' 'As soon as I realized that no one's really examined the encounter between these two iconic figures, I just couldn't help but think, 'Man, that's basically a license to print money right there.'' 'Make room in your coffers, Simon and Schuster,' McCullough continued. 'Frederick Douglass is about to lay a whole lot of golden eggs.' McCullough speculated that he would strike the mother lode by revealing the human side of the great American social reformer with riveting tales about Douglass breaking the law to teach other slaves to read. 'The book will feel very novelistic as opposed to a straight-up piece of nonfiction, and then, boom, a little bit of that signature McCullough thunder where I examine what patriotism meant to Frederick Douglass, and then the skies will open up and it will be pouring dollar bills,' said McCullough, adding that the Douglass treasure trove was good for at least 3.7 million copies and 40 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list. 'I'll have those chump readers hook, line, and sinker, eating out of the palm of my hand while Freddy D brings home the bacon.' 'After that, I can see Ken Burns and me finessing this puppy into a sweet little four-parter PBS doc. Probably pick up some nice scratch for the film rights,' continued the two-time Pulitzer Prize winner. 'I can just picture Ken's reaction when I tell him I'm thinking of doing a Douglass bio; he'll get that dollar-signs-in-his-eyes look. I could narrate that sucker, too. We'll have a regular money tree growing in our backyard.' McCullough said that if he began his research now, he could finish the book in time for his publisher to release it in hardcover for the 2014 Christmas season and then 'have that shit out' in paperback in time for Black History Month when copies would move like crazy and 'cram Davy's piggy bank with the shiny stuff.' 'Sure, the old Lion of Anacostia's been picked over pretty good, but they don't call you the master of the art of narrative history if you can't squeeze a little juice out of a trusty lemon like Frederick Douglass,' McCullough said. 'If I can just plumb some relatively obscure episode from his early years and tease it out into a thematic thread that runs through his life, I'll be sitting pretty. It'll be fields of green till kingdom come.' 'Freddy,' he added, 'come to papa.'","entertainment, history, books, news, vol 49 issue 33, entertainment"

'If I don't ever have a family, or ever get to travel, or fall in love, that will be fine as long as I can ramp up Wes Bentley's buzz and ensure that he takes the world by storm,' Schumacher said, adding that her life will be rendered meaningless if the Jonah Hex and American Beauty actor's face doesn't constantly appear on the cover of celebrity gossip magazines with captions such as 'Wes Bentley Shows Off His Killer Beach Bod,' 'Wes Wows On The Red Carpet,' and 'Behind The Scenes Of The Latest Wes Bentley Movie.'

1171,Frustrated Novelist No Good At Describing Hands,"GLOUCESTER, MA'Admitting that he has 'absolutely no idea how other authors do it,' novelist Edward Milligan, 46, told reporters Tuesday that he's just no good at all when it comes to describing people's hands in his writing. 'I'm fine with most details, but for some reason hands completely and utterly elude me,' said Milligan, who recently described a character's hands as 'dangling around like big, meaty spiders.' 'I'll often create an entirely fleshed-out character, and write easily at length about their face, their personality, their voice, their hopes, dreams, and desires, but then I try to describe their damn hands and it ruins the whole story.' Milligan, whose novella Grand Rapids was reportedly rejected by publishers due partly to a passage in which the protagonist's hand 'trundled and shimmered on the top section of his wrist,' revealed that while he is able to portray realistic trees, emotions, and most body parts, hands consistently give him trouble. Calling the way he represented the proportions of his characters' hands 'way off,' Milligan said he is especially bad at delineating human fingers, which the writer once portrayed as 'flabby pink-tan logs, but a bendy kind of log.' Milligan noted that he can envision how hands should look and behave in his mind, but always messes up when translating the imagery into words. 'Sometimes I hide the hands by saying characters had really long sleeves or having them stand behind tables, but that starts to feel awkward,' said Milligan, adding that no matter how much he practices writing about hands, 'they always come out weird.' 'I've also tried to avoid doing hand descriptions altogether, but you can only put a few amputees in your stories before people start to notice.' 'I just want to say that a character has, you know, these bigftwisty things next to her wrists,' he added. 'See? I can't do it. I fucking suck at it.' Milligan said that his problem was made more frustrating by the fact that he believes some of his writing, including the following excerpt from his unfinished novel Old Juniper, is 'actually pretty good if you ignore the parts about hands': They moved closer now, and their shadows stretched across the sand, twin silhouettes cut from the same canvas. She laid her finger hub across his tentative, dandelion hands and then slowly let that glorious gripping machine tighten like a mighty vise until at last she could feel that their spirits, too, were entwined, just like their touching-organs were, except emotionally instead of physically. Readers of Milligan's work agreed that the passages concerning hands tended to be especially distracting. 'I enjoy Edward's writing, but it's true the hands can really take you out of it,' said reader Evan Forster, 39, who mentioned he was jarred by a sentence calling someone's hands 'bony ball-sticks that grab hard.' 'I don't think he's doing it on purpose, because everything else seems normal. It doesn't make sense when he tries to gets around it by saying that people's hands are 'hand-like in their stature and bearing.' What does that even mean?' 'Then he tries to shoehorn in something like a guy who's always moving his hands so fast no one can see what they look like,' Forster added. 'It's clear what he's doing.' The exasperated 46-year-old novelist admitted that in some cases'including a passage in which a couple walks along a path 'arm-foot in arm-foot''he isn't even sure what he was going for in the first place.

'We are absolutely thrilled that Wings has garnered not one but 10 nominations from the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, including twin Outstanding Lead Actor nominations for Tim Daly and Steven Weber for their portrayal of the Hackett brothers,' Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said of today's groundbreaking announcement, in which Wings also racked up nominations for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series and Best Director for Andy Ackerman for the Season 4 finale, 'Date Package Number 7.'

1178,Fox Books Files For Bankruptcy,"NEW YORK'In a move that has shaken the already fragile publishing industry, struggling retail giant Fox Books officially filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy Wednesday, sources confirmed. Once known as the 'Big Bad Wolf' for its ability to put independent bookstores out of business by wooing customers with its sharp discounts and designer coffee, Fox Books is now reportedly listed as $1.74 billion in debt and owes over $190 million to various book vendors. 'For decades, our goal was to seduce our customers,' company CEO Joe Fox told reporters while standing outside his houseboat. 'Seduce them with our square footage, our discounts, our deep armchairs, and our cappuccinos. But brick-and-mortar bookstores are becoming a thing of the past, and our lack of capital resources has forced Fox Books to petition for reorganization relief under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code.' 'This place was all about giving our customers the Fox Books experience,' the shrewd yet thoroughly likable and charming Fox continued. 'You could sit and read for hours and no one would bother you. We had 150,000 titles. It was a place where people could mingle and mix and just be. We were a goddamn piazza!' According to analysts, with Amazon and Apple absorbing the lion's share of the market, the once dominant retailer has reportedly suffered a stark decline over the past three years, posting a 44 percent decrease in sales and a net operating loss of $244 million. Though extremely profitable at one point, the store was occasionally criticized for its cold approach to revenue. After opening a location in Manhattan's Upper West Side in 1998, protesters'in an attempt to save a local independent children's bookstore'chanted, 'One, two, three, four. We don't want this superstore.' The Upper West Side location will reportedly close in the fall, which Fox said was a shame because he just loves New York in the fall. 'We're just going to have to go to the mattresses; it's an expression from The Godfather,' said Fox, going into a slight Marlon Brando impression. 'It means you have to go to war. And that's what we have to do to get this company back in the black. Go to the mattresses. See, The Godfather is the I Ching. The Godfather is the sum of all wisdom. The Godfather is the answer to any question. What should I pack for my summer vacation? Leave the gun, take the cannoli. What day of the week is it? Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Wednesday. So what we have to do here is go to the mattresses.' 'That's what the last name Fox is all about,' he added. 'F-O-X.' While Fox remains resilient, those familiar with the publishing world said it would be difficult for Fox Books to make a comeback, and told reporters that the recent failure of the company's e-reader, The FoxTale, was a death knell for the business. 'In my experience with him, Joe is very persistent, so if he puts his mind to something I wouldn't count him out,' said Fox's wife and noted children's book author Kathleen Kelly-Fox, who recently started Brinkley, an imprint of HarperCollins named after the couple's golden retriever who passed away in 2008. 'I used to think that instead of his brain there was a cash register, and instead of his heart there was a bottom line, but when you really get to know him, he's the sweetest, most passionate person. Honestly, the only thing we argue about is what video to rent on a Saturday night. Actually, some people fight about that, but not us.' 'Have you heard the story of how we met?' Kelly-Fox continued. Though Kelly-Fox is standing firmly behind her husband, the news of Fox Books going into bankruptcy wasn't received with much disappointment in the literary community, with many writers calling the bookstore big, impersonal, overstocked, and the enemy of the mid-list novel. 'Frankly, I say good riddance,' said New York Observer columnist Frank Navasky, whose recently released book about the Luddite Movement in 19th-century London has sold very poorly. 'Hopefully this will pave the way for an independent bookstore revolution. I believe independent bookstores are lone reeds standing tall, waving boldly in the corrupt sands of commerce.' 'In the end, I believe people want a bookstore with a sort of Jeffersonian purity to it,' he added. Digital publishers and online retailers don't see the tide turning in Navasky's direction either, saying that the days of physical bookstores are numbered. When asked to comment about his role in forcing Fox Books into bankruptcy, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos called Joe Fox a friend but said, 'It's not personal, it's business.' He then repeated that mantra several times.","entertainment, business, books, news, vol 49 issue 29, entertainment"

'Oh, Christ, you just know Aaron Sorkin is already dying to clamber up on his high horse and tell people exactly how the media dropped the ball on this story at the time and exactly how he would have gotten it right,' said Eugene, OR resident Sarah Vandenberg, echoing the thoughts of the country's 310 million citizens while doing a panicked mental calculation to determine just how long the show will have to stay on the air for the Newsroom universe to catch up to the events of Martin's death and the subsequent criminal trial of George Zimmerman. 'Honestly, I just don't know if I can make it through Will McAvoy's self-righteous monologue criticizing other news outlets for selectively editing Zimmerman's 911 call, or listen to an articulate new black staff member's passionate, perfectly rehearsed speech to the rest of the News Night team at ACN about what it feels like to be racially profiled, or see how a heated office debate over race in America will somehow affect Jim and Maggie's relationship. I just won't be able to handle that, okay? So please, please let the show be canceled by then.'

'Assuming a fake identity really gave me a lot of freedom to build out the world of Hogwarts and flesh out the characters without drawing unwanted attention to myself or having the novels associated in any way with my political career,' Gingrich said in a statement, confirming reports he wrote the first four books in the fantasy series while still in office, but wrote the remainder before his 2012 presidential run. 'I am happy readers enjoyed my books, as I myself have always felt a very strong personal connection to Harry, Dumbledore, Hermione, and all of my other characters. Honestly, I miss them all every day.'

1191,New Michael Bay Romantic Comedy To Focus On Love Story Between 2 Explosions,"LOS ANGELES'Saying that he's wanted to do something a little more personal for some time now, director Michael Bay, known for such big-budget action films as Transformers and Armageddon, announced Tuesday the start of production on What Are The Odds?, a quirky romantic comedy about two unlikely explosions who fall in love. According to Bay, who also wrote the script for the film, the rom-com centers around a type-A helicopter blast who thinks it has it all figured out when a free-spirited diesel truck explosion unexpectedly enters its life and shakes everything up. 'It's really a nice little story because, on paper, these massive fireballs know they are wrong for each other, but they also have this undeniable connection they can't ignore,' said Bay, adding that he'd actually been thinking about making a pared-down film about the small, everyday interactions between detonations since studying film in college. 'This movie asks common, everyday questions like, 'How does a jet-fueled explosion find love in this day and age?' and 'Can a high-octane blast really settle down? Or will it always chase any cheap-thrill oil tanker explosion any chance it gets?'' 'And the movie's funny, too,' Bay added. 'When a big misunderstanding leads to one explosion blowing up the Eiffel Tower and the other destroying the Empire State Building, well, let's just say audiences are going to get a kick out of that scene.' From the fireballs' memorable meet-cute, when the two flaming eruptions accidentally bump into each other after one wave of fire blows through the Holland Tunnel and the other detonates when a 16-wheeler careens over a highway overpass, to how they initially fall in love after razing a New York café in a fiery inferno, Bay said that What Are The Odds? is, at its core, a love story. While Bay didn't want to give too much of the plot away, the director said that even though the explosions' combustible materials couldn't be more different'jet fuel is lighter than diesel and has anti-microbial agents, he noted'both ultimately share a common desire to settle down and one day blow up the United Nations building. And, according to a smiling Bay, this is a film where dreams and desires definitely come true. 'You know, the more you live, the more you understand that an explosion, whether it's a mushroom cloud pluming over Alcatraz or a fireball from a detonated extraterrestrial robot, only wants one thing: another explosion to share its life with,' the Pearl Harbor director told reporters. 'I think I try to find that connection in all my films, but this movie gives me a chance to tell that story in a much more intimate way.' Though shooting has just begun on the project, Bay said his lead pair of proximate pyrotechnics have the most chemistry of any two explosions he's ever had the privilege of working with. Bay remarked that the intimacy they share will certainly help during a particularly sexy scene when both fireballs intertwine with one another and blaze up an elevator shaft, and when the two have a major fight and burn Los Angeles to the ground. The cast is reportedly rounded out by the helicopter explosion's best friend, a quirky fertilizer plant explosion, and the truck explosion's father played by a 'very funny' James Brolin. 'There is definitely the typical rom-com staples in this movie, but the film has a lot of depth and tells a story about relationships that I think moviegoers will really connect with,' Bay said. 'Buildings come crashing to the ground, airports go up in flames, the Brooklyn Bridge gets incinerated, thousands of cars get blown up, and Mt. Rushmore gets turned into dust.' 'It's a departure, for sure,' he added, 'but I think it will be interesting for audiences to see this side of me.' According to studio sources, the budget for What Are The Odds? is $250 million.","entertainment, movies, our annual year 2013, news, vol 49 issue 26, entertainment"

1195,Eminem Terrified As Daughter Begins Dating Man Raised On His Music,"ROCHESTER, MI'Hip-hop artist Marshall Mathers, a.k.a. Eminem, said he was left wholly terrified today after meeting his daughter Hailie's new boyfriend Justin Denham, an 18-year-old who was reportedly raised on the rapper's music. Saying he could barely fathom the thought of Hailie, 17, with a man who ever enjoyed listening to, or was inspired by, his often misogynistic and violent lyrics, Eminem, 40, claimed he was disturbed from the second Denham said he was 'a huge fan' of all of the rapper's seven albums. 'Justin said I was his favorite artist when he was growing up, and now he wants to go out with my little girl,' said Eminem, telling reporters he didn't even want to imagine what Denham's views on relationships could possibly entail given his self-professed love of albums that include songs about mutilating women. 'Honestly, I don't really know what I'm supposed to do here. How am I supposed to let Hailie go out with a guy who says I was a huge influence on him and all of his friends?' 'I mean, this guy's probably listened to my song 'Kim,'' Eminem continued. 'I rapped about cutting my wife's throat and then driving around with her in my trunk in that song. Jesus.' Citing lyrics where he discussed raping a woman with an umbrella to 'make her pussy wider,' the visibly shaken multi-platinum artist said he can't imagine sitting by while his oldest daughter spends time alone with a man whose worldview could have been even slightly influenced by any of his songs. Eminem added that while Hailie has repeatedly claimed Justin is a 'good guy who treats her well,' he seriously doubts anyone who likes the song 'Kill You,' where he brutally describes killing a woman and hiding her in a closet, could ever be a decent person. 'His favorite song is 'Superman''a track where I said I was going to put anthrax on a girl's tampon and slap her until she can't stand,' said Eminem, adding he could only imagine the types of drugs and alcohol songs like 'Purple Pills' and 'Crack A Bottle' had led him to do. 'He better not think he can get away with all this stuff with Hailie. Or maybe he does. I mean, this is a guy who was listening to me rap about beating women ever since he was just a kid.' 'And his parents let him listen to it?' Eminem continued. 'What kind of house was that? I don't even want to think about what kind of people they are.' Eminem went on to say he was even further dismayed when Denham said he also grew up listening to artists such as Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and Ludacris, and told reporters he could only imagine the sorts of relationship lessons he pulled out of music like 'Bitches Ain't Shit' and 'Move Bitch.' 'At this point, I suppose it would be ideal for Hailie to date someone who never listened to any one of my songs, ever,' said Eminem. 'Why can't she find someone who listened to music that wasn't about having sex with prostitutes and then painting a room red with their blood?' 'Jesus,' Eminem added, 'I have to go find my daughter right now.'","entertainment, celebrities, music, our annual year 2013, news, vol 49 issue 26, entertainment"
1196,"Scalia, Thomas, Roberts, Alito Suddenly Realize They Will Be Villains In Oscar-Winning Movie One Day","WASHINGTON'Shortly after turning in dissenting opinions in landmark federal rulings today that struck down the Defense of Marriage Act and conferred full federal benefits to married same-sex couples, Supreme Court justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, John G. Roberts, and Samuel Alito reportedly realized today that they would someday be portrayed as villains in an Oscar-winning film about the fight for marriage equality. 'Oh, God, the major social ramifications, the political intrigue, all the important people involved in the case'I'm going to be played by some sinister character actor in a drama with tons of award buzz, aren't I?' said Scalia, joining his fellow dissenting justices in realizing they would be antagonists in a film potentially titled Defense Of Marriage and probably written by Tony Kushner. 'I'm going to be portrayed as a closed-minded Neanderthal and the very symbol of backward thinking. And at the end of the movie, when my character realizes he's on the wrong side of history, the audience will feel emotionally fulfilled because the hero attorney, probably played by George fucking Clooney, will have won. Great.' While they added that they aren't looking forward to being vilified on screen, Scalia, Roberts, Alito, and Thomas all agreed that the movie would probably be pretty good, and that they could see Paul Dano getting his first Academy Award nomination for his supporting role as a gay rights crusader.","entertainment, movies, supreme court, news in brief, vol 49 issue 26, entertainment"

'Oh, I just do a lot of web stuff, you know, in the digital tech kind of realm'it's not really all that interesting,' the visibly uncomfortable screenwriter and film director reportedly told Hobson during their wedding reception, before noting that Steven Spielberg, Samuel L. Jackson, and others in attendance were fans of his 'work with computers.' 'No, I don't know who Han Solo is. Someone asked you about him? Hmm, I have no idea. Must be some guy who worked at my data-tech company way back. What about your work, though? I love hearing about that. How's that going?' According to sources, Lucas informed his new wife that Skywalker Ranch, where the two were wed, was named for the property's previous owner, Carl Skywalker, and was still full of 'a bunch of that guy's old junk.'","entertainment, news in brief, vol 49 issue 26, entertainment"

1201,"Johnny Depp Now Physically Unable To Walk Unless Whimsically Teeter-Tottering Across Rolling Log, Wobbly Plank, Or Swaying Beam","LOS ANGELES'Sources close to the Lone Ranger and Pirates Of The Caribbean star confirmed Monday that unless Johnny Depp is playfully keeping his balance while wobbling along the length of a ship's mast or comically teeter-tottering across a rolling log floating in water, he is now physically unable to walk without falling over. 'The other day we were walking in the city, and he must have lost his balance and fell down 60 times, but as soon as various sections of the ground broke apart underneath him and started swaying back and forth, well, he flailed around a lot and made some wide-eyed, funny facial expressions, but he didn't fall down once and made it across unharmed,' said a close friend, adding that because of the injuries Depp has sustained while trying to walk on stable ground, the actor now prefers the tops of moving trains to sidewalks. 'And if he ever runs, he has to first be chased by an angry mob of some kind and, secondly, be inside a giant wooden wheel that he's moving forward with his own momentum. Otherwise he will fall flat on his face.' Sources who work at Depp's Los Angeles residence told reporters that the actor almost broke his neck attempting to exit his home last Monday and now only mischievously swings on chandeliers to get from his bedroom to the front door.","entertainment, celebrities, news in brief, vol 49 issue 26, entertainment"

'I've always wondered if eating fast food could potentially have some health risks, so I'm looking forward to watching Value Meal and finding out about some of the heretofore unexamined pros and cons of this industry,' said Denver resident David Jarrett, adding that he is looking forward to the documentary exposing the inner workings of the likes of McDonald's, Burger King, and Wendy's to the general public for the very first time. 'Finally, we'll get a glimpse into how fast food restaurants operate behind the counter'how they produce and cook the food, their treatment of livestock and general farming practices, and the working conditions of their employees, so that I can learn what problems, if any, exist at these establishments. Man, it's about time someone made a documentary like this, you know?' Reached for comment, extremely anxious executives from every major fast food corporation expressed their terror to reporters that Value Meal may dissuade Americans from ever eating at their restaurants again.","entertainment, fast food, news in brief, vol 49 issue 25, entertainment"
1205,Ecstatic American Indians Praise 'The Lone Ranger',"Finally Our Story Is Being Told,' Tribespeople Say LOS ANGELES'Upon emerging from an advance screening of the Walt Disney Pictures film The Lone Ranger, representatives of the country's American Indian population enthusiastically praised the action-adventure comedy Wednesday, telling reporters that they were thrilled to finally see a movie that does justice to the stirring history of the nation's native peoples. 'At long last, we have a tale befitting the long, proud tradition of our tribespeople,' said Douglas Walking Bear Akando, 94, a Potawatomi tribe elder who claimed he was moved to tears by lead actor Johnny Depp's stoic, thoroughly researched portrayal of the spirit warrior Tonto in the upcoming Jerry Bruckheimer production. 'For all of Hollywood's failed attempts to create something that accurately recounts our glorious past while also honoring the bravery and wisdom of our ancestors, The Lone Ranger does just that. And on July 3, the American people will finally know our story.' At press time, a coalition representing the nation's estimated 3 million American Indians had released a statement completely forgiving the United States for its systematic butchery and subsequent confinement of their people, saying that the new Lone Ranger movie 'had made it all worth it.'","entertainment, disney, news in brief, vol 49 issue 25, entertainment"

1211,'After Earth II' Tanks At Box Office,"LOS ANGELES'According to box-office returns, the new Will Smith film After Earth II, the sequel to last month's science-fiction adventure-drama After Earth, performed disastrously in movie theaters over the weekend. 'We had hoped and assumed that audiences would be excited to see how the onscreen father-son relationship between and Will and Jaden Smith would develop in a follow-up film, but admittedly the box-office numbers fell short of our expectations,' Columbia Pictures president Doug Belgrad said of the $145 million sequel, which was filmed simultaneously with After Earth last year and scheduled for cinematic release two weeks after the first film's premiere. 'There were hopes that the introduction of Willow Smith as Zenya Raige, the long-lost little sister of Jaden Smith's character who was raised on another planet, would pique interest, but that unfortunately does not appear to be the case. There are also some indications that the release date was poorly timed.' Studio executives added that returns for the first and second installments of the film franchise did not bode well for next week's premiere of After Earth III starring Jada Pinkett Smith.","entertainment, movies, news in brief, vol 49 issue 25, entertainment"
1212,"If Cast And Crew Of Local Production Of 'The Music Man' Being Honest, 'Marian The Librarian' Number Needs Work","GREENSBURG, PA'Saying that the iconic number simply isn't where it needs to be at this point, nearly everyone involved in The Greensburg Playhouse production of The Music Man agreed Sunday that, if they were being perfectly honest, the song 'Marian The Librarian' still needs a good bit of work. Cast and crew members told reporters the production absolutely cannot afford to have a weak 'Marian,' and said the sad truth of the matter is that the three-minute dance break remains unpolished; the Greensburg Junior High chorus members who volunteered to play students don't know when to shut their books, open them, or sway back and forth; and that if the show were to go up tomorrow, the number would be an embarrassment. Visibly nervous Greensburg Playhouse officials repeatedly mentioned that opening night is only nine days away. 'My honest assessment? 'Marian The Librarian' is at 50 percent right now, and it needs to be at 110,' said director Paul Stutzman, adding that the while Allen Bielecki and Melissa Hodge are both doing a fine job in the roles of Professor Harold Hill and Marian Paroo, the number just isn't coming together as he'd hoped. 'People are going to come here expecting a classic 'Marian The Librarian,' and if we don't give it to them, we have no one to blame but ourselves. It's certainly not up to my standards, it's not up to Greensburg Playhouse standards, and if they're being truthful, I think Allen and Melissa would tell you it's not up to their standards.' 'Better to get this all out in the open now rather than the day before we open,' he added. 'The funny thing is they nailed it during auditions.' According to members of the local production, the lackluster state of 'Marian The Librarian' has been the elephant in the room for quite some time, with many questioning when Bielecki and Hodge would eventually smooth out the choreography, specifically when Bielecki chases Hodge around the book cart and when Hodge stamps library cards in beat with the song. Moreover, reports indicate that Bielecki continually has trouble with the number's syncopated rhythms, and, in what has been a problem everyone has been too scared to talk about from day one, the 44-year-old insurance adjuster has difficulty hitting the lower notes, especially at the end of such phrases as, 'If I stumbled and I busted my what-you-may-call-it/ I could lie on your floor unnoticed/ Till my body had turned to carrionfMadam Librarian.' Of utmost concern, sources confirmed, is the emotional connection between the two characters, which to some is lacking, and to others is 'barely even noticeable.' 'I honestly don't see how this all gets fixed in nine days'I really don't,' said lead choreographer Anne Cavalier, 56, noting that every look, every touch, and every harmless shove has to come at a precise moment in the song. 'At its best, 'Marian The Librarian' is a meticulous, playful seduction, where, for the first time, we see that Marian Paroo is capable of letting her guard down. We see that not only is she charmed by Harold Hill, but could potentially fall in love with him. At its worst, its a total momentum killer. We're somewhere in between.' 'The main problem is I'm not seeing Harold Hill and Marian Paroo up there,' she continued, 'I'm seeing Allen Bielecki and Melissa Hodge.' While those close to the production confirmed that 'Rock Island' and '(Ya Got) Trouble' are certainly close, a great Music Man reportedly depends on a knockout 'Marian The Librarian,' which many are calling the emotional lynchpin of the entire production. Some members of the cast are hopeful that the number will be ready to go by opening night, though most are quick to point out that the show is basically in dress rehearsals, and without extr","entertainment, music, news, vol 49 issue 24, entertainment"

'I've been trying to book my brother-in-law, who occasionally watches Mad Men and could probably fill some time talking about that, but he just called and said he has to guest-host his buddy's podcast,' said Robert Healy, host of The TV Robcast and one of the quarter billion podcasters nationwide who cannot secure a guest with whom to engage in 45 minutes of inane banter about politics, food, stand-up comedy, or rock music. 'I could run a 'Best Of Robcast' special, but I did that last week, and I want to keep it fresh.' The report also stated that no podcasters will consider simply not releasing an episode this week, as not one of them wants to risk losing any of the 14 listeners they have been steadily cultivating for the past year and a half.","entertainment, news in brief, vol 49 issue 24, entertainment"
1214,Panicked Studio Delays 'Man Of Steel' To Get More Shots Of People Looking Up In Awe,"LOS ANGELES'Citing a dire need for additional reshoots, visibly panicked officials at Warner Bros. studios announced Wednesday that they had decided to delay the release of the upcoming Superman film Man Of Steel in order to get more footage of people looking up in wonder and awe. 'At this time, we have alarmingly few shots of awestruck passersby looking up at the sky, squinting just a touch, and making an 'I can't believe what I'm seeing right now' face, which means we have no choice but to delay Friday's release indefinitely,' Warner Bros. president of distribution Dan Fellman told reporters, noting that filmmakers are currently rushing to finish a critical sequence in which a man in a business suit lifts his head skyward, exhibits a mesmerized expression on his face, and holds his hand to his forehead as Superman whizzes by. 'We have a fair amount of scenes of fathers holding young children in their arms and pointing straight up, but even then, we're going to need at least another six weeks of shooting in order to get more shots of cab drivers swiftly turning their heads and saying 'Did you see that?' or 'HolyEE.!''

1215,Weird Porno Stops At Kissing,"PASADENA, CA'A local 46-year-old man expressed confusion and disappointment Wednesday after watching what he described as a 'really weird' pornographic movie that featured no nudity of any kind and contained only a few brief kissing scenes that never once led to a sexual act. 'It's about this all-American girl-next-door type and her fascination with a sleazy, gray-haired guy, which is usually the kind of thing I'm into, but it turned out to be the strangest porn I've ever seen,' said surprised viewer Peter Lindy, explaining that the feature-length 1999 film was based entirely around whether the lead male and female characters will get together in the end, and though they eventually do, 'you never see anything close to full penetration.' 'I just thought with all the tension between those two, it would turn into a huge fuck-fest, but instead they just make out. At one point, Maggie and Ike exchange a really hot kiss at this wedding rehearsal, and you think someone's going to step in and Eiffel Tower her or something, but it never happens.' Though perplexed by the film, Lindy confirmed that the final wedding scene was 'still pretty hot,' so he was able to get off anyway.","entertainment, news in brief, vol 49 issue 24, entertainment"

'Everybody knows Liberace for his extravagant wardrobe, virtuosic piano performances, and endearing Midwestern sensibilities, but what a lot of people don't know, which this film shows, is that Liberace also counted a number of gay men among his close personal friends,' said television critic Jeff Wasser of the film, which shows Liberace, famed pianist and lover of figure-skating champ Sonja Henie, developing friendships with many homosexuals, whom he often invited to his home for dinner, swimming, and conversation. 'He was apparently quite progressive in that regard and did not discriminate against gay men in the slightest, despite being a famous ladies' man. In fact, he would even bestow numerous gifts upon his gay male friends as a token of his friendship.' Wasser added that he particularly enjoyed the film's portrayal of Liberace's relationship with his gay chauffeur, who became perhaps his closest buddy.","entertainment, news in brief, vol 49 issue 24, entertainment"

My wife and I were sitting on the couch and we both just turned and looked at each other, like, 'Whoa. That was intense.' I mean, I vaguely remember writing something like that, but that was years ago, you know? You forget these things. And you don't see it coming, either; that's the thing. The previous episode capped off with the marriage of Tyrion Lannister and Sansa Stark, which seemed like it might be the real big event in a season that has largely been concerned with puzzle pieces falling into place. So with only two episodes left before the season's conclusion, I was just looking forward to some more juicy exposition, no more, no less. But no! Catelyn Stark, Robb Stark, his wife Talisa and their unborn child'hell, even Robb's wolf, Grey Wind'all slaughtered on the same night by the traitorous Walder Frey and his league of Lannister sympathizers! And at the end of a wedding no less! A goddamned wedding! And here I was sitting on my couch like a child thinking about how sweet it was that Talisa wanted to name the baby after Ned Stark, and how emotional it would be in two minutes when Robb finally met up with Arya, who was right outside the whole time. I was looking forward to that scene for three whole episodes! I was 100 percent sure I had written it, too. I mean, who doesn't want Arya to reunite with her family? Then out of nowhere, boom! Catelyn Stark's neck is sliced open with her firstborn son dead at her feet. And I suddenly remembered, 'Oh, yeah! I did that.' I think it was in Book Four. Or Book Three? One of those. The worst part, though, was the moment right when I started to realize what I had written. It was after Lothar Frey went to the back of the room and closed those big doors and Catelyn Stark looked over at Roose Bolton and saw that he's wearing chainmail under his nice clothes. That was the moment I thought, 'Fuck, that's right. I think I might kill off Robb Stark here.' And then I did! And boy, was it a hard to thing to watch, especially when I had also completely blanked on the fact his mom dies right after. This fucking show, you know? One minute Robb Stark is solidifying his military power on his way to King's Landing and the next he's bleeding out on the floor. Just goes to show you can't get too attached to any of my characters. Hell, I'm still getting over the death of Ned Stark in Season One. And even though it's my responsibility as an author to protect the integrity of my novels at all costs, I have to admit that I personally wouldn't have noticed if they'd completely changed the story at that point and the episode had ended happily. Hell, those books were written a long time ago; you can't expect me to remember every last detail. Sure, I'm an executive producer on the show and they send me all the scripts on these things, but I never read them. Those things are full of spoilers. At any rate, holy shit! I almost don't want to see what I do next week. All I know is Tyrion better not get killed, because if he dies I'm done with this show, man. Done.","opinion, entertainment, books, our annual year 2013, commentary, vol 49 issue 23, george r.r. martin, entertainment"
1231,Angelina Jolie Stuns In First Rollerblading Competition Since Double Mastectomy,"ARCADIA, CA'Famed actress and activist Angelina Jolie wowed Grindside Street Comp spectators Sunday in her first public aggressive inline skating competition since undergoing a preventive double mastectomy earlier this year. 'I think a lot of people were wondering what it would be like when she got back out there on the half-pipe again, but her performance was flawless'she's a world-class blader, and she proved it today,' fellow women's vert competitor Cecilia Gonzales said of 37-year-old Jolie, who reportedly dazzled the crowd with an inspiring arsenal of stunts including a top-acid turn, an alley-oop unity, and a stunning double backflip. 'When she opened with a frontside I figured she was just going to take it easy, but then she goes and pulls a sick mizou with a 540 hurricane. And I was just like, 'Damn. Still got it.'' When interviewed after receiving third place in the women's vert event, Jolie told reporters it was great to be back and urged young skaters to consider the importance of proper training and protective gear.","entertainment, angelina jolie, celebrities, our annual year 2013, athletics, news in brief, vol 49 issue 23, entertainment"
1232,New Liver Complains Of Difficulty Working With Lou Reed,"NEW YORK'Just weeks after being transplanted into Lou Reed's abdomen, a 3.5-pound donor liver voiced complaints to reporters Monday about the difficulty of working with the 'temperamental' rock legend. 'It's really hard to get along with Lou'one minute he's your best friend and the next he's outright abusive,' said the vital organ, describing its ongoing collaboration with the former Velvet Underground frontman as 'strained at best.' 'He just has this way of making you feel completely inadequate. I can tell he doesn't respect me at all. In fact, I'm pretty sure he's already thinking about replacing me.' The liver admitted it was considering ending its detoxification sessions with the 71-year-old recording artist and just letting him synthesize proteins and digestive biochemicals on his own.","entertainment, news in brief, vol 49 issue 23, entertainment"
1233,Perhaps The Gimmick Of My Father And Me Starring In A Movie Is Actually More Annoying Than Appealing,"When I was first presented with the opportunity to act alongside my father in our latest movie After Earth, I couldn't have been more excited. It seemed like a surefire hit at the time'I mean, wouldn't the movie-going public just be over the moon to once again see Will and Jaden Smith on the silver screen playing father and son? But now that I actually take a step back and really think about it, I'm starting to wonder if maybe'and I could very well be overthinking this, so bear with me here'the gimmick of my dad and I starring in the same film is actually more obnoxious than appealing. And maybe not just obnoxious, but super obnoxious. Downright repellent, actually. In fact, I'm starting to think that instead of seeing the movie posters and trailers for After Earth and thinking, 'Oh, what a cool idea, Will Smith and his son are acting together,' people are actually rolling their eyes and saying, 'Give me a fucking break.' Now, I know that's kind of a strange concept given the success both my father and I have had in Hollywood over the last decade. When I first started my career as a professional actor at the age of 8, I think people actually enjoyed seeing me work alongside my dad in The Pursuit Of Happyness. I guess it was kind of endearing in a way because I came off as sort of naïve and, to be truthful, I probably surprised people with my acting ability. But I can't help but think that maybe, somewhere along the line, when my wealthy, A-list celebrity parents began developing projects solely as vehicles to build my career and make the Smith family hundreds of millions of dollars richer than it already was, the concept of my father using his clout to shoehorn me into co-starring film roles might possibly have started rubbing people the wrong way. I can certainly see, for instance, how my dad contriving a $130-million Hollywood science-fiction film in an attempt to promote me to his level of fame and fortune could maybe come across as a tad self-serving. In fact, maybe'just maybe'people might view the movie as less of a great film starring an actor they love and his lovable son, and more of a soulless vanity project. Or go so far as to say such blatant nepotism and hunger for fame is the biggest problem in Hollywood today, and in the United States of America as a whole. It's possible, is all I'm saying. Let's just say, for argument's sake, that I was an average, everyday American consumer. Would I enjoy seeing an incredibly rich and famous man use his money and power to make his children incredibly rich and famous? Would I enjoy seeing the face of a young teenager plastered on movie posters across the entire nation, not because of who he is, but because of who his father is? To be totally honest, I'm not so sure I would. In fact, it's conceivable that I might find it unbelievably infuriating and downright unbearable. Then again, though, when I take a step back and really think about it, I guess there are maybe one or two things that my family does that could put off the general public. Like my parents completely manufacturing a singing career for my younger sister Willow, for example. Or my musical collaboration with Justin Bieber to promote my last film, The Karate Kid. In fact, one might say that my entire friendship with Justin Bieber, and the image of two very rich, very entitled teenagers hanging out until six in the morning may in fact hurt my overall image, as opposed to enhancing it. Does that make sense? Come to think of it, I suppose it is entirely possible that there are a few moviegoers out there right now who are saying something along the lines of, 'Actually, this whole movie seems really cold, calculated, and designed purely to raise the media profile of the film's millionaire movie star and his young, precociously famous son. And, because of these things, I do not want to see After Earth at all. I'd much rather go see that dumb magician movie this weekend instead.' Hell, one could even conceivably argue that my parents are doing me a huge disservice by giving me a career that I didn't necessarily earn myself, creating a wave of ill will toward me that will be more or less impossible to shed for the rest of my life. And, as it were, maybe raising me and my sister in the glamorous, vapid cocoon of Hollywood and setting absolutely no boundaries whatsoever for us and allowing us to pretty much do and have whatever we want is not, in fact, a good way to raise children. You know, at this point, I wouldn't fault someone for thinking that my father and mother have utterly lost their grip on reality and what it means to be a normal human being in today's world. But hey, at the end of the day, I'm rich, I'm famous, I'll soon be getting my own house, and my newest movie will probably make millions of dollars at the box office this weekend. So who gives a fuck what you people think?","opinion, entertainment, commentary, vol 49 issue 22, jaden smith, entertainment"

1235,You Haven't Seen 'Frances Ha' Until You've Seen It In IMAX,"As a director, I have always strived to present my work to the audience in such a way that it accurately reflects my artistic vision in its purest form, so that what is displayed on the screen is as close as possible to my original conception of the film. This has never been more true than for my most recent project, Frances Ha, a lively paean to youth and dreams, and one which absolutely must be viewed in the film format that it was intended to be viewed in, which of course is IMAX. I mean, when you're making a wry, naturalistic movie about a vivacious but immature twentysomething trying to find her way as a dancer in New York City, you really have no choice but to just go for it and shoot it in bold, high-resolution 70mm IMAX film stock. In fact, that's actually what I said to myself when I was writing it: 'This is going to be my IMAX movie.' So I just went all out when I was writing it, tailoring every character and scene for maximum impact on a six-story IMAX screen in a 601-person amphitheater. The studio was reluctant initially'IMAX isn't cheap, after all. But I told them, 'Look, trust me here. Frances Ha is going to be one of the most exhilarating IMAX experiences ever created.' Luckily, they put their faith in me. And the effect, to be honest, is simply stunning. Through the magic of IMAX, every social faux pas, every quiet epiphany, every dinner party, and every awkward conversational exchange practically jumps off the screen. You feel as though you can almost reach out and touch the glass of white wine that a character is drinking. Simply put, no celluloid version of Frances Ha could provide the same visceral impact as witnessing a 30-foot-tall Greta Gerwig towering above the audience as she negotiates her relationship with her best friend or tries to find an apartment, all displayed in vivid black-and-white. That's why I tell people who are seeing the movie, 'Please, do yourself a favor and see it in IMAX.' After all, it's Frances Ha we're talking about here, not some movie you can just catch later on DVD because who cares what format you see it in. Movies like Frances Ha are why IMAX was invented in the first place, for God's sake. And if you can catch it in IMAX 3D, even better. Every day I was on set, I felt so spoiled getting to work in such a dynamic film format. I was like a kid in a candy store. And what I did with this astounding technology was create a glorious, high-definition world so real you actually think you're there, from an apartment in Brooklyn, to a different apartment in Brooklyn, to a street in Brooklyn, to an apartment in Manhattan. It's pure movie magic! Look, if you're not watching the scene where Frances equivocates on her employment status in IMAX then you're not really watching it. Same goes for the scene where she talks to her former roommate. And the scene where she talks to her parents. And the scene where she talks to her new roommate. Also, you have to hear whimsical French composer Georges Delerue's spritely score thundering out in Dolby digital surround sound or, frankly, you might as well not buy a ticket for the movie at all. So, this summer, when Frances Ha lands at your local IMAX theater, I advise you to grab your popcorn, take a front-row seat, and buckle up. It's going to be one hell of a ride.","opinion, entertainment, movies, commentary, vol 49 issue 22, noah baumbach, entertainment"

'Mr. Bieber was rushed into the ER late last evening after enduring heavy boos, and while the situation was pretty touch-and-go for a while there, his vitals look good and we are hopeful he will eventually make a full recovery,' emergency medical specialist Dr. Isaac Liss said of the 19-year-old singer, who entered the hospital after being badly hurt by a chorus of jeers, jibes, and heckles while accepting the fan-voted Milestone Award. 'We're just trying to administer lots of love and praise right now. He's still on shaky ground, but with a steady, round-the-clock course of fawning adulation, I think Mr. Bieber will one day soon, with luck, be able to make another awards show appearance.'

1256,Woody Allen Extremely Busy Updating WoodyAllen.com,"NEW YORK'Stressing that 'continuously adapting to new technology is a must,' famed writer, actor, and director Woody Allen confirmed Thursday that he remains incredibly preoccupied with maintaining and updating his personal website, WoodyAllen.com. Allen, who initially launched WoodyAllen.com back in 2002, told reporters he is regularly implementing new features, interface changes, and promotional tools into what he calls 'the one-stop internet destination for all things Woody Allen.' In addition, Allen said he loves how the site gives him the ability to interact with his fans, either by uploading numerous iPhone pictures of himself on set or just 'lounging around [his] apartment,' or by posting quick daily updates to let them know what he's up to. 'In this business, it's all about getting yourself out there and having a direct relationship with your audience,' said the Academy Award'winning director of Annie Hall, adding that he's always tinkering with the site's layout to keep WoodyAllen.com sleek, simple, easy-to-use, but most importantly, Allen noted, fun. 'These days, everybody has a website, so it's really easy to get lost in the shuffle. So I'm on my MacBook the first thing every morning making sure 'Woody Allen' continues to be a name people recognize.' 'Basically, your web presence is an extension of who you are,' Allen added, later saying that the internet is a great place for building your personal brand. 'For example, when you first get to my welcome screen, you click on a silhouette of my glasses to get to the home page, and then the nav bar appears above a big black-and-white headshot I scanned in. And I just made it so Benny Goodman's 'Roll Em' plays in the background, too. I try to add as many of those little personal touches as I can, just to make myself stand out more.' WoodyAllen.com features an About Me page with a 600-word self-written bio, as well as an extensive gallery of both performance stills and family photos of Allen, wife Soon-Yi Previn, and their two daughters. The site also contains a filmography page with a list of Allen's 70-plus feature films, a link to his IMDb page, and a 'Woody's Work' section that includes embedded clips from Hannah And Her Sisters, Manhattan, and Crimes And Misdemeanors. Additionally, Allen recently incorporated an integrated blog where the 77-year-old posts entries about his personal life several times a day. The posts range from shorter entries such as 'It's a gorgeous day in New York City! What do you guys like to do when it's nice outside?' to longer musings in which Allen openly discusses the ups and downs in his relationship and his past marital troubles. Saying that engaging directly with your fanbase is more important than ever, the Husbands And Wives director also added an 'Ask Woody' section in which he answers fan emails by recording his responses into his webcam. 'I'd say in any given week, I spend about 40 percent of my time on my creative projects and the other 60 percent updating my site,' said Allen, explaining that while he 'has a guy to help with the more technical stuff,' he updates the website himself and has even picked up some basic HTML and CSS coding. 'It's worth it, though. Not only can I post new pages of the script I'm working on, but then my fans can give me feedback on what they like or don't like.' 'I love getting their input about my work,' Allen added. 'The fact that they get to be included in the creative process is wonderful.' According to Allen, the time spent crafting the website has already paid off. 'Without WoodyAllen.com, Midnight In Paris never would have been made,' said Allen, pointing to the site's Contact page where he lists his email address. 'See, I made it easy for Sony Pictures to get in touch with me. My email address is immediately visible, and if they want to see a sample of other projects I've worked on or my early Jack Paar appearances, my YouTube reel is right there.' Allen said he is constantly on the lookout for positive online reviews of his work to include in the Press section of WoodyAllen.com, should any other studio executives visit his site in the future. Moreover, the 60-year film veteran reportedly always cross-posts his blog entries, photos, and status updates to his Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram accounts in an effort to interact with fans and draw more traffic to the site. 'Everything needs to be synched up, especially on social media,' said Allen, who posts daily tweets asking his followers for feedback on new story ideas and suggestions for improving his dialogue. 'That's how it is these days, and I'm happy to change with the times.' 'It's a lot of work, but ultimately, it's just been a real thrill getting to know my fans,' he added. 'That's my favorite part.'","entertainment, celebrities, internet, news, vol 49 issue 19, entertainment"

'Despite all the ups and downs, I was so sure Rihanna was the one I'd take by the throat one day and fatally assault, and even toward the end I continued to hold out hope that we'd be together until the day she died at my hands from blunt-force trauma,' Brown, 24, said in a radio interview this week, telling DJs he still has abusive feelings for his ex-flame and is hopeful that he might punch her again one day. 'It's hard knowing that there's some other guy out there who gets to beat her senseless. In fact, for all I know, there might be someone out there assaulting her right now. And let me tell you, that guy is the luckiest guy in the world.' A saddened Brown added that, should the couple not reconcile, he remains confident that the special someone he was meant to beat to death is still out there for him, and when he finds her, he'll waste no time in slapping her around.","entertainment, celebrities, relationships, news in brief, vol 49 issue 19, entertainment"

Some sort of TV star?' said church member Jill Holland while trying to find any real reason whatsoever why the death of Arbus, a fashion-photographer-turned-actor best known for his role as Dr. Freedman in the popular sitcom M*A*S*H, was God's way of punishing America for its moral decay and cultural decadence. 'As far as I know, he wasn't gay or bisexual, or the victim of a high-profile mass shooting or terror attack, or an American soldier killed in combat or anything like that. In fact, I'm pretty sure we're just holding 'God Hates Fags' signs outside the funeral of some 95-year-old man who used to be on television for a while.' At press time, church members had overheard that Arbus was of Jewish descent and said, 'Okay, well, that's something.'","entertainment, news in brief, vol 49 issue 17, entertainment"
1270,"Report: Folks, Bette Midler Is Back On Broadway And Not A Minute Too Soon","NEW YORK'According to a report released this week by the Brookings Institution, actress, singer, and comedienne extraordinaire Bette Midler is finally back on The Great White Way in a dynamite new one-woman show and, people, it's about time, too, because that woman is just a knockout performer, pure and simple. 'Our analysis shows that the Divine Miss M has returned to Old Broadway in top form and, frankly, would you expect anything less?' read an excerpt from the report, which is right on the money, folks, because that woman can sing, that woman can act, and that woman has more talent in one little finger than most people have in their whole bodies. 'Further analysis shows, conclusively, that happy days are here again, friends: The blonde diva's back in full force as she channels Hollywood super-agent Sue Mengers in a performance that's vintage Midler. Do yourself a favor and run, don't walk, to the Booth Theater.' At press time, only Garland and Merman at their peaks could hold a candle to Midler, and even saying that might be a bit of a stretch.","entertainment, celebrities, news in brief, vol 49 issue 17, entertainment"

'I see a lot of myself in how he sort of plays by his own rules and always stays true to his morals no matter what. He also makes these really cool, sarcastic remarks that other characters in the show think are funny, and I kind of do that, too,' Brooks said of the character who resembles no actual human being who currently exists in reality, has ever existed in reality, or will ever exist in reality. 'And the way he can be so abrasive and arrogant while still maintaining a high-pressure job, managing a core group of devoted friends who admire him, and juggling multiple relationships with incredibly gorgeous women'I'm totally like that sometimes.' Brooks added that the only character in the show he finds it difficult to relate to is the main character's brother, an unkempt and lazy 28-year-old who spends the majority of his time sitting around his apartment watching television.","entertainment, human interest, news in brief, vol 49 issue 16, entertainment"

'Say, where is everybody?' the film's protagonist Paul Wallace said to his traveling companions as they stood alone in an empty and eerily quiet plaza, unaware that it happened to be the week of July 6, when the city celebrates its annual festival of San Fermín. 'And why is the ground trembling? Maybe it's an earthquake or'oh my God! Run for it, guys!'

'Good idea,' said the staffers who were scared to death of disagreeing with Sorkin, even though they all reportedly felt that his thoughts on season two were lame, idealistic to a nauseating extent, and basically just a way for Sorkin to use his characters to bark his clichéd platitudes at television viewers. 'That's a smart direction. I hadn't even thought of that.' Before silently going back to work, sources confirmed that every writer in the room was privately thinking that if they only had the balls to stand up to Sorkin and fight for the fresh ideas and storytelling techniques they brought to the table they could make the show immeasurably better.","entertainment, television, news in brief, vol 49 issue 15, entertainment"

1286,'Mad Men' Premiere Features Group Of Actors Who Are Scared To Death Of Never Making Transition To Film,"NEW YORK'After concluding its fifth season last June with Don Draper and company facing new personal and professional challenges, the critically acclaimed AMC series Mad Men returns Sunday with a two-hour season premiere featuring a group of television actors terrified to death of never making the transition from television to film, sources confirmed. 'In this new season, we wanted to really explore how a group of nervous small-screen performers navigate a professional world in which they constantly worry about not being taken seriously by the film industry,' Mad Men creator Matthew Weiner told reporters, adding that the new season picks up six years after the actors first appeared in the series with the goal of building their name recognition on television, branching out into smaller movie roles, transitioning to feature films, and hopefully disassociating themselves with their Mad Men characters. 'This has been a common theme since the third season. But now that the series is almost coming to a close, I think it will be very interesting to see how these actors freak out about what they're going to do in two years when Mad Men has disappeared from public consciousness and they still haven't had anything close to a leading role in a major motion picture.' Weiner added that while he doesn't want to spoil anything, it will become very clear by season's end that one prominent performer will more than likely end up on Showtime in a role where he plays himself and makes fun of his career.","entertainment, news in brief, vol 49 issue 14, entertainment"

1289,Disney Finds Dozens Of Unauthorized Characters Appearing Illegally Inside Theme Park,"ORLANDO, FL'Saying they were working diligently to address the problem, Walt Disney World officials acknowledged Wednesday that several dozen unauthorized characters, none of which have ever appeared in a Disney film or cartoon, had been found in recent weeks wandering throughout the theme park. Company sources confirmed that at least 60 separate individuals in costumes, including various woodland creatures, several fairies, and what officials described as a walrus in a lab coat, have been spotted greeting visitors, hugging children, posing for pictures, and meandering into daily parades alongside sanctioned Disney characters. 'I want to assure Disney World visitors that these unaffiliated characters are being rounded up as we speak and removed from the Magic Kingdom, Epcot, and Disney's Hollywood Studios,' said company spokesperson Wesley Aldridge, noting that patrons may still encounter certain individuals wearing ox costumes, Belgian peasant girl costumes, or any number of other unfamiliar outfits for the time being. 'However, before approaching any costumed individual in our park, you should ask yourself whether you recognize this character from an officially licensed product in the Disney or Pixar catalog. If not, please let security know immediately.' 'If you are taking your picture with Chompers the Iguana, for example, you are not taking a picture with an official Disney character,' Aldridge continued. 'That's just a man in an iguana suit. That man does not work for Disney. He doesn't belong here.' Aldridge emphasized that none of the non-Disney-brand characters appeared intent on causing any harm and noted with astonishment that not a single one had been found charging money for photographs, concluding that such individuals seemed to 'just enjoy being at the park.' Indeed, officials speculate that each offender pays full price for a ticket, enters with their costume stowed in a bag, changes in a Disney restroom, and then emerges to greet crowds or perform short dance routines they have prepared themselves. While security reportedly kicks out an average of 20 unauthorized characters each day from the theme park and Disney Family Breakfasts at onsite hotel properties, sources stated that nearly all return to the premises. Disney workers claimed that some reenter park property within just hours of their expulsion, citing in particular a muskrat named King Stumpy as well as a boisterous prospector character calling himself Grandpappy Gizzards, who has been forcibly removed from Frontierland every day since mid-February. 'My daughter and I spent 45 minutes in line waiting to meet someone named Princess Maureen,' said 34-year-old Faith Gosselin of Nashua, NH, one of many visitors reportedly duped by the 15 or so unlicensed Disney princesses and emperors that park officials allege are wandering Fantasyland at any given time. 'She told my daughter she came all the way from the Diamondonia Kingdom on her flying shark to meet us. It didn't make any sense, but I just figured she was from a new movie or something.' 'But then I saw Captain Hook come up to her and tell her really sternly that she needed to leave,' Gosselin added. 'He was pretty mad.' In an effort to appear more genuine to park patrons, sources reported that many of the unsanctioned characters have developed their own intricate mythologies and unique, non-Disney-affiliated catchphrases such as 'Jumpin' juniper' or 'Wowie-kazaam!' 'There was this squirrel over by Splash Mountain who said he was one of the Scurry Brothers and asked if we'd been on his ride called the Admiral Acorn Adventure,' said father of two Troy Milizia from Auburn, NY. 'When we said we hadn't, he brought out a mountain bike with a little wagon chained behind it and asked us to hop in. He told us it was just like the scene from his movie where he travels down the mountain pass in search of acorns.' 'The kids loved it, but I had no idea what he was talking about,' Milizia continued. 'Once he stopped pedaling and asked us if we wanted to go again, I just grabbed my girls and got out of there.' While Disney officials reiterated that most fraudulent characters posed no threat, they singled out a possum with a cane and top hat as particularly troublesome, noting that the ornery character is often seen sitting on the Main Street, U.S.A. curb and is known to go by the names 'Portly Possum,' 'Prickly Possum,' 'Patty O'Possum,' 'Possum Pete,' or 'Pop-Pop Possum.' 'There has never been a Disney film that has featured a possum, and we would like to make it abundantly clear to visitors that no licensed Disney character will ever chew tobacco or wear an orthopedic back brace on the job,' said Aldridge, holding a photograph of the counterfeit character. 'And we urge you not to purchase the Possum-Time Hoedown DVD he's selling out of his backpack. It's really very bad.'","disney, entertainment, news, vol 49 issue 14, entertainment"

'Winter is coming, and with it a dark scourge that shall leave no man untouched, no kingdom unconquered,' says one of the show's protagonists, Jon Snow, as the characters Catelyn Stark and Mance Rayder rapidly insert their fingers into his rectum while the rest of the show's extensive cast also expound on the return of winter while having their own anuses and vaginas vigorously fingered. 'These are dark days that await us, brethren. May the gods show us mercy, if indeed mercy they have.' Though viewer reception to the season premiere has been positive, fans of the hit series were reportedly disappointed that the episode failed to resolve the previous season's cliffhanger in which a nude Tyrion Lannister eagerly masturbated a dragon for half an hour.","entertainment, game of thrones, television, tv, unsponsored, news in brief, vol 49 issue 14, entertainment"

'Those dumbasses over there will go see this crap, right?' said Steve Siskind, the studio's executive vice president for worldwide marketing, who predicted 'the dipshits in Asia or somewhere' could be counted on to boost box-office receipts for the fucking unbearable $200 million production. 'Transformers 3 was huge in China, so why wouldn't those morons go apeshit over this movie, too? It has tons of CGI, not to mention a car flying through a helicopter and landing on the roof of a building. Plus, there's no real story to follow, so language barriers shouldn't be a problem.'

'To all the viewers who supported our show on NBC and would love to see the next chapter of Animal Practice played out on the big screen, I can only say from the bottom of my heart: Please don't ever do this,' lead actor Justin Kirk said in a direct plea to fans, noting that the nine-episode sitcom about a misanthropic veterinarian was terrible and that any campaign to revive it would make him and other cast members deeply upset. 'I'll say it right here: Being a part of this show was a pretty bad career move and one that I'm trying to move past. Honestly, I would have to say that anyone who is a fan of the show has bad taste and I don't really have any respect for them. Sorry, but I don't.'

'I'm sure they've batted my name around before, and maybe a few ideas have been bounced off producers.

1316,Report: Most Couples Met On Set Of 'Daredevil',"WASHINGTON'Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner's appearance at the Academy Awards Sunday undoubtedly inspired fond memories in the estimated 73 percent of American couples who, according to a new report from the U.S. Census Bureau, also met on the set of the 2003 superhero film Daredevil. 'Survey data collected over the past 10 years reveals that, just like Jen and Ben, the overwhelming majority of couples in the United States first met while visiting, working on, or passing through the set of Daredevil,' said Joseph Frey, the statistician who compiled the report, noting that 28 percent of partners got to know each other while doing gaffing or lighting work, 18 percent met while in line for on-set catering, and 15 percent simply visited the set and were introduced by mutual friends. 'I myself met my wonderful wife, Kristen, while I was doing some consulting work for 20th Century Fox and she was working as a PA on Daredevil. Whenever people ask when we got together I always say, 'Well, when did Daredevil come out?' Of course, statistically speaking, there's a pretty good chance they already know the answer.' Frey added that the two are happily married with one daughter, who, like most children born in 2009, was conceived on the set of He's Just Not That Into You.","entertainment, ben affleck, news in brief, vol 49 issue 09, entertainment"

1320,240 Killed In Stampede After Bucketful Of Oscars Just Dumped On Stage,"LOS ANGELES'In one of the most devastating tragedies in the history of the Academy Awards, 240 attendees were killed in a deadly stampede at Hollywood's Dolby Theater Sunday after a bucketful of Oscars was just dumped onto the stage, triggering a frenzied rush for the statuettes by every audience member in attendance. According to eyewitness accounts, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences President Howard Koch carried a large plastic tub filled with Academy Awards to the center of the stage halfway through the ceremony and wordlessly overturned the container, sending 120 of the highly prized trophies tumbling into a pile on the floor and causing screaming audience members to abruptly vault from their seats and charge toward the stage to reach the scattered Oscars. Sources confirmed that over 1,000 guests suffered serious injuries from the stampede of actors, directors, producers, screenwriters, makeup artists, costume designers, dates, and cinematographers. 'There was this moment or two of eerie silence right after he dumped out the Oscars, and then all hell broke loose,' said actor Mark Ruffalo, bleeding profusely from a head wound and wincing in pain from an apparent dislocated shoulder. 'Christ, people just went crazy while scrambling to get those trophies. I saw people out there'people I've worked with and know well'do terrible things. Just terrible things.' 'I'm lucky to be alive,' Ruffalo added. 'And lucky that I was able to get out of there with an Oscar for Best Production Design, too.' Early reports have confirmed that Jack Nicholson, Amy Adams, George Clooney, Kate Winslet, Michael Douglas, Charlize Theron, Brave lead animator Austin Madison, Tom Wilkinson, and Jake Gyllenhaal were killed in the stampede of Hollywood elite. Mangled bodies believed to be those of Leonardo DiCaprio, Russell Crowe, Nicole Kidman, Tim Burton, Paul Giamatti, Rob Reiner, Helen Mirren, Ang Lee, and numerous others were also found but could not be positively identified at press time. While most of the fatalities were allegedly accidental, several eyewitnesses informed reporters that Sissy Spacek was, in fact, murdered. Sources confirmed that Spacek attempted to escape the bedlam with an Oscar in hand, but was cornered by the cast of Les Misérables and viciously beaten to death. 'No one was innocent tonight; everybody out there was storming that stage like their lives depended on it,' said security guard Chris Brooks, who watched helplessly as his coworkers were overwhelmed by a rush of starlets blindly searching for the nearest statuette. 'The sounds of bones snapping in half and bloodcurdling screeches will definitely haunt me for the rest of my life.' 'At one point, I turned around and saw Ron Howard, with this wild look in his eyes, strangling Lauren Bacall,' Brooks continued. 'He was covered in blood and daring people to come at him. It's an image I'll never forget.' Emergency medical responders who arrived at the traumatic scene said they were stunned not only by the sheer number of deceased A-list celebrities strewn about the auditorium, but also by the degree of emotional trauma suffered by those survivors who were unable to claim one of the free Oscars. 'Some of them came so close but just didn't quite make it,' said paramedic Virginia Cox of the televised event, which early reports are indicating was the most watched Oscars telecast in history. 'Remember, many of these people had to trample beloved co-stars and crew members in order to reach the front of that stage, so to end the night empty-handed was doubly tragic for them.' At press time, acclaimed director Steven Spielberg was reportedly last seen exiting the theater, struggling to carry approximately 57 Oscars in his arms.","entertainment, oscars, our annual year 2013, news, vol 49 issue 08, entertainment"

'If we don't guard these exits and reinforce the doors, people will literally break them down,' Regal Cinemas manager Dan Engle said as he mobilized his staff for the Jeremy Renner'Gemma Arterton action-adventure-horror film, which is scheduled to play on all 12 of the theater's screens during all scheduled showtimes throughout the day. 'Folks, I don't want to be a pain here, but in mere hours we're going to have hundreds'if not thousands'of screaming Hansel and Gretel fans lined up outside trying to see this film, and if we don't have a body at every door then these people will, I shit you not, burst into the projection room and steal the movie itself right off the projector.' At press time, officials at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had ordered extra security detail for the film's director, Tommy Wirkola, until the worldwide pandemonium dies down.","entertainment, news in brief, vol 49 issue 04, entertainment"

'Do they think I'm some kind of idiot?' said Rickman, who confirmed that he had seen the movie's trailer and read numerous dismissive reviews of it.

'I only watched The Odd Couple a few times on cable, and I guess I never realized how much Jack meant to me until he was gone,' said Iowa homemaker Beth Golding, who lay weeping and curled up on her couch, a scene that played itself out repeatedly across all 50 states. 'It's been almost a month now, and yet not a day goes by that I don't think about how actor Jack Klugman was cruelly torn away from us.

'It's hard to believe she got up there in front of all those people and rambled on like that. It's like she had no awareness of how she was coming off at all.' After explaining that she 'expected a little more taste and class' from Jodie Foster, Rhodes told reporters she was glad a number of commenters on TMZ.com agreed with her assessment.","golden globes, entertainment, news in brief, vol 49 issue 03, entertainment"

'What else am I going to do? It's not like you get rich from studying birds. Anyway, all I have to do is say something about how, if they were birds, humans would have to chew on little bits of gravel in order to digest their food.'

1375,'Zero Dark Thirty' Reveals Navy SEALs Killed Bin Laden By Frantically Throwing Whatever They Could Find At Him,"LOS ANGELES'According to reviews this week of Kathryn Bigelow's thriller Zero Dark Thirty, which chronicles the 10-year hunt for Osama bin Laden, the film's climactic scene features a team of U.S. Navy SEALs shrieking in terror as they gradually kill the al-Qaeda leader by throwing a variety of nearby objects at him. 'The mood is tense and silent as SEAL Team Six infiltrates the infamous Abbottabad compound, but then all hell breaks loose when bin Laden emerges from behind a door, causing the whole squadron to start yelling wildly as they pelt him with shoes, cups, and flimsy pieces of drywall,' wrote New York Times film critic Manohla Dargis, who mentioned that the hectic five-minute sequence shows bin Laden stumbling around with his head stuck in a sweatshirt thrown by one of the SEALs, bashing into various fixtures and shouting, 'Ow, ow!' 'Meanwhile, in the helicopter floating above the hideout, two SEALs scream directly into each other's faces while they desperately try to fly the aircraft away from bin Laden, who is also screaming throughout the entire scene.' The remainder of the film then reportedly focuses on the SEALs tentatively kicking bin Laden's corpse before retreating several feet and anxiously watching to see if he is still moving.","entertainment, news in brief, vol 48 issue 51, entertainment"

'Yes, roughly 90 percent of the film's budget will go to gaffing, but Brett brings a level of lighting expertise and cable-laying innovation that is simply indispensable,' said executive producer Todd Wainwright, extolling Atkins' 'revolutionary' electrical work on 1994's Clear And Present Danger. 'We certainly don't want another Green Lantern fiasco'$200 million of top-notch action spectacle, but Christ in heaven, the gaffing!'

1383,'The Hobbit' To Feature 53-Minute-Long Scene Of Bilbo Baggins Trying To Figure Out What To Pack,"LOS ANGELES'According to early reviews, the highly anticipated new film The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, which opens in theaters Friday, features an extended 53-minute-long scene in which the protagonist, Bilbo Baggins, decides on what to pack for his trip to defeat the evil dragon Smaug. The film, one of three upcoming Lord Of The Rings prequels based on the novel by J.R.R. Tolkien, reportedly suspends its main narrative action for almost a third of its screen time while the main character rummages through his house trying to figure out what clothing and personal possessions he will need for his journey. 'Yeah, he just sort of fusses around for a while, wondering aloud whether he should pack an umbrella or not, and laying out different coats on his bed,' said Hollywood Reporter critic Todd McCarthy, who attended an early press screening this week. 'And then there are long stretches'I'm talking like 10, 12 minutes'where he's just sitting in a chair silently thinking about what he's going to need.' 'It's pretty much the entire middle section of the film,' McCarthy added. 'And it's done with very few cuts. Most of the time the camera is just sort of staying on him without moving.' A majority of critics said the 53-minute scene, which does not appear to be based on any particular part of the novel, was not at all expected, especially given the fact that viewers had been led to believe, from the previous scene, that the film would shortly transition into the beginning of the 'unexpected journey' promised in its title. Other critics singled out a nine-minute interlude around the 100-minute mark in which Baggins, concerned about the possibility of having to attend a formal occasion during his journey, tries on a variety of outfits in the mirror. 'At first it seems as though it's going to be a short little montage of him packing, with jaunty music playing, but after a minute or two the music sort of fades out and it's just a long take of Bilbo quietly looking through drawers,' Boston Globe critic Ty Burr told reporters. 'Sometimes he says things out loud like, 'Oh, Bilbo, where did you put that sweater?' Other times he's just muttering indecipherably. And then a lot of the time'most of the time, really'he's dead quiet.' 'I mean, I guess it's pretty well done for what it is, which is essentially just a person putting stuff in a suitcase,' Burr continued. The film's director, Peter Jackson, expressed excitement about the film's premiere, and hinted that the second film in the Hobbit trilogy would chronicle Bilbo's return to the Shire after he realizes he forgot his toiletries bag.","entertainment, news, vol 48 issue 51, entertainment"

'Even while I was writing it, I could barely keep myself from putting it down. My knuckles were unwhitened the whole time, and my pulse barely pounded at all,' said Cussler, who described the book as 'far from taut, or even tight, in any way.' 'Cracking good yarn, my ass.

1393,Department Of Transportation Announces New Highway Concert Series,"WASHINGTON'The U.S. Department of Transportation announced plans Wednesday to stage Traffic Jam 2013, a brand-new highway concert series that will feature popular musical acts performing for passing motorists on America's shoulder lanes, median dividers, and overpasses. Saying the year-round outdoor events were designed to attract music lovers of all ages to the country's interstate highway system, department heads confirmed that more than 90 artists have already signed on, with top-drawer headliners such as Jay-Z, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Avicii, and Bon Iver set to play across the nation on more than 200 major U.S. roadways. 'Our goal was to put together exciting lineups that would encourage Americans to drive up the on-ramp of their nearest interstate, roll down the windows, and enjoy some live music as they travel,' Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said. 'Whether you want to hear Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre rock the mic on a Long Beach frontage road or a rousing program from the Boston Symphony Orchestra across six lanes of I-90, we have something for everyone.' 'And tickets to get onto the highways start at just $55,' LaHood continued. 'The driver of each vehicle must be 16 in most states, but otherwise these are all-ages events.' Sponsored by Bud Light Lime and Vitamin Water, the festival will also reportedly include dance performances atop freeway guardrails, nightly movies projected onto vacant billboards, and a wide variety of local food carts and beer concession stands scattered through passing lanes. LaHood added that for concertgoers looking for a quieter, more intimate highway music experience, there would also be several smaller acoustic sets on select exit ramps and turnarounds. In addition, he said, weekends will feature comedians such as Patton Oswalt and Aziz Ansari performing stand-up sets from inside tollbooths as they make change for motorists exiting the nation's turnpikes. Department officials confirmed that since presale tickets became available at midnight, more than 150,000 wristbands have been sold for Traffic Jam 2013, with most customers opting for the $200 Freeway Fun Pass, which enables its holders to traverse up to three intersecting highways to see multiple bands in a single day. 'I already bought my tickets to see Weezer, Phish, and Florence and the Machine play on the New Jersey Turnpike in March,' said New York City resident Robert Davila, adding that he was 'extremely pumped' to finally hear the acoustics in the Lincoln Tunnel. 'I thought about seeing Method Man in February, but honestly, I have my doubts about whether hip-hop sounds as good performed live on I-84's HOV lane as it does on CD.' 'Besides, all of my friends say you haven't truly experienced Phish until you've driven by the band at 75 mph and heard them belting out 'Farmhouse' from a stage on a cloverleaf interchange 100 feet above you,' Davila added. 'It's going to be amazing!' Fan enthusiasm for the Transportation Department's concert series was echoed by many of the entertainers slated to appear, all of whom told reporters they were looking forward to seeing their fans speed past their shows next year. 'This is my first highway gig, so I'm really thrilled to be getting out there on I-10 and playing the hits,' said musician Jack White, who will perform on the nation's southernmost transcontinental freeway in January. 'When I was a kid, I saw the Rolling Stones play on top of Old Faithful as part of the Interior Department's 1989 National Parks concert, so I couldn't pass up an opportunity like this.' 'That concert changed my life,' White added. Safety advocates, however, have raised concerns about the risks of highway concerts, citing an incident last month in which three out of the four members of Coldplay were killed when an 18-wheeler veered out of control while the band was sounding checking on the Long Island Expressway.","entertainment, automotive, news, vol 48 issue 49, entertainment"

According to persons with knowledge of the situation, an unnamed friend of Paxson's coworker Wendy Mathers watched the movie on opening weekend and found it to be 'decent enough.' News of this development is believed to have then led Mathers herself to see the film the following week. Though she was overheard describing its screenplay as 'kind of forgettable,' Mathers is said to have concluded that Daniel Craig's performance redeemed the movie overall, and according to witnesses, she voiced this opinion during a work meeting at which Paxon was present. Within a few days, a second coworker had reportedly seen the film and told Paxson it was 'not the worst way [he] could spend a night out.' Sources said the accumulation of these mostly positive reports led Paxson to decide the movie was probably good and to consider checking it out himself sometime this week. At press time, reports indicated Paxson was perusing theater listings and confused as to whether the new James Bond movie was titled Killing Them Softly, Deadfall, Skyfall, or Silent Night.","entertainment, news in brief, vol 48 issue 48, entertainment"

1400,U.N. Agency Says 2012 Celebrities Hottest On Record,"HELSINKI'In a report released Thursday at the United Nations pop culture summit in Finland, a consortium of leading entertainment scientists confirmed that the year 2012 has witnessed the hottest celebrities in recorded history. Citing evidence such as dangerously hot celebrity beach bodies, steadily rising chemistry between sizzling-hot megastars, and a myriad of extreme, record-breaking blockbuster movie events, the U.N. group claimed the overall hotness of celebrities worldwide is increasing at a staggering rate, with many specific celebrities reported to be 'so on fire right now it's scary.' 'We are seeing an unmistakable pattern: Celebrities across the world are extremely hot, and they are only getting hotter,' said U.N. entertainment agency director Michael Carver, who confirmed that 2012's celebrities were more gorgeous and charming than those in any year since data on hotness was first collected in 1955. 'The chance that natural variability produced such an unprecedented slew of good-looking superstars is vanishingly small.' The peer-reviewed study, which reportedly reflected a 'broad consensus' among the scientific community, indicated that celebrity hotness has soared in the past century, with nine of the 10 sexiest years in history all occurring in the past decade. According the report, after briefly leveling off in the mid-1980s, the world's celebrities have become inexorably hotter ever since, a phenomenon that has led to 2012 becoming the hottest year ever. 'Of course, you don't need complex statistical models to understand how hot today's celebrities are becoming when the evidence is all around us'just look at them,' said Carver, emphasizing that the freakishly large number of red-carpet events, album releases, and exclusive interviews was 'not a coincidence, but rather part of a long-term trend.' 'In just a few years, we've seen the abrupt emergence of Emma Stone, Ryan Gosling, and Alexander Skarsgård, among hundreds of other absolute knockouts. You would have to be blind to deny that today's celebrities are hotter than they've ever been before.' 'The mega-celebrities we have warned about for years are here,' he added. 'And they are hot.' Citing 'overwhelming evidence,' the scientists went on to suggest that the present rate of increase in celebrity hotness was unsustainable, and urged leaders to pursue alternative entertainment sources in an effort to curb it. While some commentators believe the increasing hotness of modern celebrities is a myth, the U.N. dismissed these arguments as 'fringe beliefs,' encouraging skeptics to 'take one look at Andrew Garfield or Natalie Portman,' both of whom the study concluded were 'scorching.' 'As the world's leading producer of celebrities, the United States is responsible for much of the spike,' said fashion analyst Dr. Jessica Dominguez, who noted that ravishing mega-celebrities such as Mila Kunis were capable of captivating huge swaths of the globe at a time. 'But make no mistake: Celebrities are getting hotter everywhere, from India's Priyanka Chopra to South Korea's Kim Hyun-a. If the current data are accurate, it will soon be impossible to forestall the ever-rising hotness of celebrities worldwide.'

'Children of the '90s rejoice: Cory and Topanga are back and better than ever as the parents of 13-year-old Riley, an autistic teenager whose debilitating disabilities prevent her from fitting in with peers, understanding basic instructions, or showing any affection for her parents whatsoever,' executive producer Michael Jacobs said of the new show, in which the family also copes with long periods of unemployment, their daughter's medical expenses, and the loss of Pvt. Eric Matthews in the Afghanistan War. 'We're thrilled that Ben Savage and Danielle Fishel will reprise their roles from the original series, as both are skilled performers capable of portraying the deep personal anguish that will follow their characters as they navigate the harsh realities of 21st-century American life.' Jacobs also confirmed that noted character actor William Daniels would return to the series as retired educator George Feeny, who has been admitted to hospice care after developing Alzheimer's disease.","entertainment, news in brief, vol 48 issue 48, entertainment"

1403,New Season Of 'Downton Abbey' Jumps Forward To Year 2121,"LONDON'Fans of the wildly popular period drama Downton Abbey were delighted Friday when producers announced that, following another successful run on British television this fall, the show has been renewed for a fourth season, which they confirmed will be set in the Roaring 2120s. Series creator Julian Fellowes told The Hollywood Reporter that while many details of the upcoming season have yet to be finalized, fans can look forward to more 'salacious scandals, romantic intrigues, and social transformation' as Intergalactic Warlord Ransom Glomphus III, his headstrong daughter Empress Zampthor, and other descendants of the Crawley family struggle to adjust to life on their colony in deep space following the First Interplanetary Strife. 'Downton fans around the world will be thrilled with what we have in store for the Crawley offspring and their service drones as they navigate life in the 22nd century,' Fellowes said of the new season, which features eight new episodes and a film-length Christmas special set on a distant vacation crater. 'Robert, Earl of Grantham, once saved Downton by marrying the American heiress Cora. Now, new and old worlds collide again as their progeny vie for territory against a proud lineage of space clones who have forcibly invaded the family's colony.' 'Meanwhile, Warlord Ransom's service drones struggle to reconcile their egalitarian sympathies and resentments toward the intergalactic elite with their pre-programmed instructions to fulfill directives at any cost, even if it means initiating shutdown procedures and deactivating,' Fellowes continued. Fellowes acknowledged the new episodes may be a departure from previous seasons, but said fans can expect the same attention to period detail'including meticulously designed costumes, elaborate sets, and exhaustively researched shooting locations'that Downton viewers have always enjoyed. For example, season four opens with the impeccable service drone Carlson 24 serving food pills to Ransom as the warlord paces the deck of his transport ship, which producers confirmed was reconstructed from conceptual drawings of actual ships 'as they may one day appear.' According to producer Liz Trubridge, the new season will feature British actress Imelda Staunton as Empress Zampthor's redoubtable holographic nursemaid Zoolee 1114, who will add some comic relief to a narrative fraught with intergalactic violence and futuristic psychological warfare that is 'very disturbing at times.' 'Scenes involving the harvesting of organs, for example, are very tough to watch,' said Trubridge, referencing the season's second episode. 'But one thing we know is that from wormholes to magnetic force fields to unfeeling cyborgs and heartless automatons, Julian [Fellowes] knows how to create an ensemble cast of memorable characters that will really feel like part of your family.'","entertainment, news, vol 48 issue 48, entertainment"

'We wanted to take this story that everyone knows'the CIA's rescue of six U.S. diplomats from militant Islamist captors in 1979'and use the cultural backdrop of South Boston to explore it in this whole new way,' said Affleck, explaining that he and the film's producers considered several other locations, including New York and Tehran, before deciding the movie should take place in Boston. 'We stayed true to this tale of international intrigue and theocratic infighting, but at the same time infused it with some of the Southie grit that, you know, really captures the streets of blue-collar Boston. When viewers see the main character, Grand Ayatollah Sully, drive past those classic Boston landmarks'Faneuil Hall, Harvard Yard, Fenway'I think that's when Argo is going to resonate with them most.' Affleck also confirmed that his next film, a remake of Martin Scorsese's The Departed set in present-day Boston, will begin shooting in spring 2014.","entertainment, news in brief, movies, ben affleck, vol 48 issue 46, entertainment"
1422,"Man Googles Matt Damon's Address Because, Well, He's Crazy And Wants To Murder Him","SALISBURY, MD'After rereading actor Matt Damon's Wikipedia page for the 13th time since 9 a.m. today, local man Dan Easter decided to look up the celebrity's home address on Google because, well, he's admittedly crazy and wants to murder him. Saying he planned to 'just click around' a couple websites to see if the Bourne Identity star's address was listed anywhere on the Internet, Easter told reporters that, you know, he's ultimately a mentally ill madman who wants to break into Matt Damon's house in the dead of night and, you guessed it, kill him in front of his wife and children. 'I figured I would just type Matt Damon's name into Google because, to make a long story short, I'm psychologically disturbed and I want to assassinate him,' said the 29-year-old man, who, by his own admission, is extremely unstable and has absolutely no business being anywhere other than a mental institution. 'I see him in movies and magazines all the time, and it made me wonder where he lives. I'm also clinically insane. That's why I want to go there and strangle him to death.' 'You know how it is. I'm just one of these fucked-up guys you read about who allows his obsessions to not only overtake him, but to put others in grave danger as well,' he added correctly. 'There's not much more to say, really. I have a psychological disorder that produces an irrepressible urge to kill Matt Damon. That's why I Googled his address, and that's why I want to murder him. Simple.' Easter, a lunatic who is perfectly happy identifying himself as such, said he got the 'little psychotic notion' to look up the A-list actor's address after watching Ocean's Eleven on television, a film he recorded on his DVR and has watched more than 200 times in the past month. He said that Damon's captivating performance in the film, coupled with his own grandiose delusions and complete detachment from reality, gave him the idea to find out where the actor lives and see if his home was easily accessible to someone carrying a knife or gun. He also told reporters that he wondered what it would be like to kiss Matt Damon on the mouth. 'I was just zooming into Google maps and muttering the words 'Matt Damon' to myself over and over'like the deranged individual I am'when I said, 'Dan, you should drive across the country with your 100 Bagger Vance DVDs and finally just kill the guy,'' said Easter, adding that he would probably wear Damon's clothes after he killed him because, let's face it, he's crazy. 'You know how it is. Or, actually, you probably don't, because you're not psychotic like me.' 'Here's the thing: I have a lot of respect for Matt Damon as an actor and a person,' the disturbed man continued. 'I actually like him quite a lot, but that's also why I want to him to die. That's just how my mind works.' Easter, who went on to list all of Matt Damon's career accolades and ways that he wants to kill him, said that his initial interest in locating the actor's address also made him curious about where Damon's various co-stars lived'including actors Ben Affleck, Will Smith, and Charlize Theron. 'I'd probably like to murder those people, too,' Easter said. 'Anyone affiliated with Matt Damon I want to murder. Maybe I'll spare Jude Law. Why? I don't know why. Because when you're this mentally disturbed, there really is no rhyme or reason to anything.' The unbalanced man then told reporters that after he killed Matt Damon, he would likely stroke the actor's hair for 20 minutes, sleep in his bathtub for the night, and, why the hell not, steal his dog'all actions one might expect from someone who is mentally unhinged. Easter said that when authorities arrived at the scene of the crime he would admit to being a sociopath because, well, that's what he is. 'In brief, yes, I've called 9-1-1 multiple times wondering if emergency dispatchers could help me find Matt Damon,' Easter explained. 'So I'm probably on some kind of government list, and if I'm not, I really should be. After all, I'm a very sick person with delusional tendencies who wants to find Matt Damon's house, break inside, and murder him.' 'What can I say? I'm convinced I have to slice Matt Damon's throat,' he added. 'That's how it is when you're insane and off your meds.' At press time, Easter was reportedly flipping through a collection of Matt Damon photos and screaming at the top of his lungs.","entertainment, matt damon, news, vol 48 issue 45, entertainment"

'Steven realized that given the brutal scenes of slavery, the horrific Civil War battles, and an ending in which the hero is killed in cold blood, his movie might benefit from a little comic relief,' said a source at DreamWorks Pictures, adding that the film includes a 'hilarious' rail-splitting scene in which an ax head flies off its handle and hits the Great Emancipator squarely in the genitals, as well as a humorous mishap that causes Lincoln to open the Gettysburg Address with the words 'Four score and seven years agooOOOWWW!' 'We spent about a week shooting pickup footage, and Daniel Day-Lewis got so into character he would improvise taking-it-in-the-nuts routines that weren't even in the script.

Reports from early screenings indicate overwhelming audience approval of the film's new ending, in which John Wilkes Booth shoots Lincoln, screams 'Sic semper tyrannis!' and leaps from the Ford's Theatre balcony only to land crotch-first on an iron handrail.","entertainment, steven spielberg, news in brief, vol 48 issue 42, entertainment"

'The minute the cameras stopped and the stuntman inside the costume got out of it, I'd take the suit back to my trailer and have my way with it.

1451,Tommy Lee Jones Tells Jimmy Fallon He Doesn't Want To Play Any Of His Little Fucking Games,"NEW YORK'Prior to his appearance on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon last week, actor Tommy Lee Jones informed the host that he had no intention of playing 'any of [his] little fucking games,' according to sources at NBC. 'Listen here, Howdy Doody, I'm not putting on a wig, I'm not doing your skits, I'm not reading any Mötley Crüe lyrics, and I'm sure as shit not singing the Men In Black song with your goddamn band,' said the Oscar winner, who was on the show to promote his film Hope Springs. 'Here's what's gonna happen. I'm gonna walk out there, sit down, and tell you an amusing anecdote about my movie. Then you're gonna roll the clip, thank me, and have a producer walk me to the elevator. That's it. Nothing else. Zippo. I'm a 66-year-old man, for Christ's sake. So you and your giddy little writing staff can just calm the fuck down.' Fallon reportedly replied by saying 'awesome' eighteen times, and then instructed a production assistant to ensure singer Rickie Lee Jones stayed hidden in her dressing room until her surprise serenade of the similarly named guest.","entertainment, news in brief, vol 48 issue 39, entertainment"

At press time, Basset was waiting in line at his local Barnes and Noble alongside dozens of fans dressed up as the middle-class English teachers, doctors, and shopkeeper characters featured in Rowling's new book.","entertainment, harry potter, news in brief, vol 48 issue 39, entertainment"

1456,Nick Jr. Suspends Production On 'The Almighty Muhammad's Porkalicious Toon Jihad',"LOS ANGELES'Responding to the ongoing protests from millions of Muslims over the depictions of the Prophet Muhammad, American television channel Nick Jr. announced today it was suspending production on its forthcoming children's program The Almighty Muhammad's Porkalicious Toon Jihad. The half-hour animated television show, which centers around the wacky Jihadist adventures of the Islamic prophet and his mischievous pig friend Abrahammy, was slated to begin airing this October. 'At this time, our company believes it is best to temporarily remove The Almighty Muhammad's Porkalicious Toon Jihad from Nick Jr.'s fall programming schedule,' Viacom executive Todd Coates said. 'While we still believe that thousands of young viewers would really enjoy seeing Muhammad go on his weekly pilgrimages to his big bacon mosque with his rabbi friends Hershel and Moishe, our company nonetheless believes it's best to indefinitely postpone the show's release.' 'This isn't to say Porkalicious Toon Jihad will never see the light of day,' Coates added. 'Hopefully, when the international climate is slightly less volatile, children will be able to enjoy all of Muhammad's hijinks, especially in the episode 'Weeee! Muhammad,' in which he takes his yearly hajj to Mecca Land by sliding down the Magical Chute of Greasy Bacon Fat.' Members of the show's staff told reporters that the surprise cancellation comes just as they had completed 12 out of the show's 24 episodes, including a very special Eid-ul-Fitr Porktacular, in which the prophet learns to get along with his infidel enemies after they teach him how to truly enjoy the beach by surfing on a Quran. Showrunners also regretted that children would not be introduced to the program's beloved character Allah, who in the cartoon is portrayed as Muhammad's attractive cool babysitter, whom the young prophet is constantly trying to impress. 'The show might sound a little controversial, but I think after watching it people will get that 'Porkalicious Toon Jihad' is just a big fun time,' show creator Matt Radnor told reporters. 'Personally, I think the episode where Muhammad and Allah learn to work with Satan to pull off the Medina Town Fair is quite uplifting.' At press time, Mattel announced it had also halted production on thousands of the Almighty Muhammad promotional items, including clothes, lunch boxes, and a kit that would allow children to dress up a plastic figurine Muhammad in more than 17 different types of pig-based accessories.","entertainment, news, vol 48 issue 38, entertainment"
1457,Posthumously Recorded Bob Dylan Album Receives Rave Reviews,"LOS ANGELES'Singer-songwriter Bob Dylan's posthumously recorded 35th studio album Tempest, released Sept. 10, has been enjoying widespread acclaim from top music critics across the country, with many praising the late Dylan's largely undiminished songwriting skills. 'While he may never again match the series of masterworks he recorded in the '60s and '70s, when he was alive, Dylan has entered a true late-career renaissance since passing away,' Chicago Tribune music critic Greg Kot wrote in his review of the fourth album Dylan has recorded since his death in 2005. 'Dying has lent his voice a certain rough yet poignant gravitas. One can clearly hear how the dead tissue in his vocal cords has deteriorated to the point where there's almost nothing left. Nothing, that is, except the genius of a master songwriter still in full command of his powers, even seven years after expiring.' While critics have almost unanimously found Dylan himself to be in fine form on the new album, a number of reviews have criticized the playing of his backing band as lifeless.","entertainment, news in brief, vol 48 issue 38, entertainment"

'This film will ramp up the action and tension in the original United 93 by a factor of five,' Fox vice president Adam Bronford promised Tuesday, adding that the film's tagline will be 'We Don't Negotiate with Predators.' 'In addition to terrorist hijackers, the passengers will face traveling carnivorous space chameleons who blend into their surroundings and pick off passengers one by one for their alien blood sport. We won't give out any spoilers, but it's fair to say a planeload of brave, freedom-loving Americans will prove to be more than those Predators bargained for.'

1467,Everyone In Improv Troupe Balding,"NEW YORK'Every member of local improvisational troupe 'Calhoun' is balding, audience members observed Tuesday during the group's 8 p.m. performance. According to sources, the group'which spent the majority of its 35-minute set playing various silly characters, doing outrageous voices, and pretending to be animals or members of the opposite sex'consists solely of adult males in their mid-to-late 30s who are either completely bald or have severely receded hairlines. 'Great fucking set,' out-of-breath Calhoun member Daryl Crane said after the performance, sweat collecting in rills on his thin-haired scalp. 'Everyone was on fucking fire. Adam, that move you made, when you called back to the prison scene'where the hell did that come from? Fucking genius.' 'I was, like, I'll just follow Adam and see where this thing goes,' added Crane, his slightly undersized American Apparel T-shirt tightly hugging his sweaty, protruding stomach. Calhoun, which features balding members Crane, 37, Sam Rosen, 36, Nick Clewson, 34, and Michael Fray, 33, met at a local improvisational comedy theater in 2004. Each member completed five training courses and took several classes together, during which, according to the follicly challenged men, they bonded because other members in the class 'didn't really get [their] weird sense of humor.' Along with losing a substantial amount of hair over the past eight years, group members have also never received any type of compensation for their performances, and have in fact lost upwards of $5,000 traveling to various improvisational festivals. In addition, not a single member of the troupe, all of whom graduated from college more than a decade ago, has ever held a job paying more than $45,000 a year. 'We met and it just clicked because we shared the same comedic sensibilities,' said Clewson, whose hairline, while robust by the group's standards, begins approximately 7 inches above his eyes. 'When people ask me to characterize our voice, I say it's like an equal mix of really silly and really smart. Like that scene we did where Abraham Lincoln is a freshman in college'why the fuck was Anne Frank there? That's such a classic Calhoun scene.' Throughout their time in the group, members of Calhoun'most of whom also smoke cigarettes, spend a majority of their time hanging around a theater with other balding performers, and take advantage of much younger female newcomers to the improv community'have prioritized rehearsals and performances over responsibilities to family, friends, and work. Clewson quit his full-time job last summer and took on a temporary catering position to devote more time to improv. Rosen didn't go home to his family in Minnesota last Christmas because the group was asked to open for a weekend mainstage show, after which Clewson cornered a manager from a talent agency and got his business card. At press time, the manager has not replied to Clewson's e-mails. 'We've been getting our names out there, for sure,' said the almost 40-year-old Crane, referring to several recent performances attended by small groups of their friends. 'We've been making steady inroads in the city, and trying to do more traveling. Last year we went to Montreal for Just for Laughs. We didn't have a slot, but we did a lot of great networking.' 'We're doing awesome,' the visibly out-of-shape and haggard-looking Crane added. 'But we can't get complacent. We're going to take a refresher class with [balding improv teacher Eric] Corpin next month. That guy's a genius. He was a consultant on that Kelsey Grammer sketch show.' While the group has written half a dozen television spec scripts and created several web video shorts, members insist that improvisation will remain the basis of everything they do. In fact, the group is thinking about writing a sketch show cobbled together from some of their most successful improv scenes. Fray and Rosen, both of whom have wives and children to support, believe 2013 will be Calhoun's year. 'We are close to something big,' said Fray, who three years ago decided that if he didn't start making money from performing within the next year he would quit improv altogether. 'I can feel it.'","entertainment, news, vol 48 issue 36, entertainment"

1471,'Breaking Bad' Creator Thinking Maybe Next Season Should Take Dark Turn,"LOS ANGELES'Following last Sunday's Breaking Bad midseason finale, creator and showrunner Vince Gilligan told reporters that in a departure from the 'light, fun tone' that has characterized the program thus far, the concluding episodes may take more of a darker turn. 'Ever since the very first episode, in which [main character] Walt is diagnosed with cancer and forced to sell meth to provide for his pregnant wife and cerebral-palsy-stricken son, I've thought that perhaps one day we could begin taking the show in a grittier direction,' said Gilligan, adding that while the program's ongoing depiction of a man slowly succumbing to an illegal lifestyle defined by power, violence, and alienation was fine for four and a half seasons, he 'wouldn't mind' eventually exploring some grimmer themes. 'I know our audience has gotten comfortable seeing Walt regularly kill drug dealers, endanger his family, and poison small children, but, personally, I think people would be interested in seeing a slightly more sinister side to the character.' Gilligan's announcement comes just weeks after fellow AMC showrunner Matthew Weiner announced it was 'entirely conceivable that the next season of Mad Men may touch on how men deal with marriage.'","entertainment, our annual year 2012, news in brief, vol 48 issue 36, entertainment"

1477,Netflix Board Of Directors Meets To Decide If 'Michael' Is Stream Worthy,"LOS GATOS, CA'According to sources within the company, Netflix's board of directors held a tense series of meetings Friday to decide whether the 1996 fantasy-comedy Michael, starring actor John Travolta, should be included among the movies available through its instant-viewing program. Netflix, which debuted its Watch Instantly service in 2007, boasts a library of tens of thousands of titles, each of which requires at least 70 percent approval from the seven-member board before it is cleared for streaming. Reports indicated the final decision on whether to include the Nora Ephron'directed Michael, in which a vulgar, cigarette-smoking angel visits Earth, is still pending and has required numerous rounds of voting from the board. 'Michael would be an invaluable addition to our catalog, and I strongly recommend we act on this immediately,' chief content officer Ted Sarandos reportedly said moments after the 8 a.m. meeting was officially called to order. 'The film is a PG-rated romp with broad cross-generational appeal, and Travolta is a huge draw for the 45-to-60-year-old demographic, which we've really been struggling with lately.' 'Some may call it a risk, but frankly, Michael is a risk I'm willing to take,' Sarandos continued. 'We can't afford to wait around on this. We need to push it through today.' As with any new film under consideration by Netflix, executives held two back-to-back screenings of Michael: the first to get a general feel for the picture, and the second for critical analysis. They then discussed the movie in detail, carefully scrutinizing each scene and reviewing such criteria as story, acting quality, number of quotable lines of dialogue, and level of enjoyment upon subsequent viewings. Sources said that while the procedure to add a movie can be relatively straightforward, as with unanimously approved titles such as Iron Man 2 and, some films, like Never Been Kissed, Dante's Peak, and Rango, have been far more contentious, often resulting in fiery board room clashes and even threats to quit the company. 'The board quickly reached a favorable consensus on the bar scene where Michael dances to 'Chain Of Fools,'' said a source familiar with the proceedings, speaking on condition of anonymity. 'But there were bitter disagreements over the film's ending, in which Michael and Pansy dance together while time is frozen. [Board members] Jay [Hoag] and Ann [Mather] felt it was an excellent way to wrap things up, but others found it both corny and totally anticlimactic. That pretty much brought the meeting to a standstill.' Stretching late into the evening, the Michael meetings were reportedly punctuated by several executives storming out of the conference room following particularly fierce disputes over the quality of Andie MacDowell's performance, as well as by heated exchanges over the quirky casting of actor William Hurt as cynical tabloid journalist Frank Quinlan. 'Obviously, I can't get into all the specifics of what we're discussing in there,' said executive George Battle, speaking to reporters outside of Netflix headquarters during a short reprieve from the contentious talks. 'But I will say that if [company director] Rich [Barton] honestly thinks Andie MacDowell was better in Michael than she was in Short Cuts'or even Multiplicity, for that matter'then he's out of his goddamn mind. And that you can quote me on.' At one point, sources said, frustrated board member Timothy Haley, known throughout the company as a strong Michael proponent, stood up and slammed his fists on the table, shouting that even questioning whether the film merited inclusion in the Watch Instantly program meant the company had 'lost the very ideals upon which it was founded.' At approximately 11 p.m., Netflix co-founder and CEO Reed Hastings reportedly made one last effort to sway the board to approve the move. 'Michael represents the next step for our company,' Hastings wrote in a company-wide e-mail obtained by reporters. 'The stockholders may not approve of the decision initially, but I'm willing to stake my whole career on its success. And if I go down for this one, then so be it. That's how strongly I feel.' 'I love the part when Michael brings the dog back to life after the truck accident, and then his wings fall off,' Hastings added. At press time, sources confirmed the board had narrowly passed the motion to introduce Michael into the Netflix streaming catalog, but remained deadlocked over the 1999 baseball-themed romantic drama For Love Of The Game.","entertainment, news, vol 48 issue 35, netflix, entertainment"

1494,Foundation Honored For Work With Developmentally Disabled Celebrities,"LOS ANGELES'During a gala dinner at the Avalon-Carver Community Center Thursday night, officials from the City of Los Angeles honored the Shining Star Foundation for its ongoing work with local developmentally disabled celebrities. Saying she was ""incredibly humbled"" by the award, Shining Star founder Rachel Davis emphasized the tremendous efforts of her dedicated staff, whose work has helped make daily life easier and more manageable for prominent special-needs stars like Jeremy Renner, Susan Sarandon, and John Legend. ""We started Shining Star with one simple but vital goal in mind: to provide our mentally challenged actors, actresses, musicians, and television personalities with the assistance they so desperately need,"" Davis said to the gala's 250 attendees. ""We get up every day aiming to make a difference in their lives, even if it's something as small as driving them to Santa Monica and helping them buy designer clothes, or taking them out for some exercise with a personal trainer. We're there for them."" ""Obviously some of our celebrities will never be fully independent,"" Davis continued. ""But seeing Bradley Cooper, for example, move into a 15,000-square-foot Beverly Hills mansion and only need us to stop by twice a week to make sure he's eating well and cleaning up'well, that's what we hope to achieve for everyone."" Davis told reporters she was inspired to start a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping disabled celebrities after watching Martin Landau struggle through his Best Supporting Actor acceptance speech at the 1989 Golden Globes and realizing that ""something had to be done to help these people."" One year later, Shining Star's flagship Beachwood Canyon facility opened to great acclaim, providing the likes of Andy Garcia and Andie MacDowell with access to basic, day-to-day disability services, including assistance with bathing, getting dressed, and driving to and from major Hollywood movie studios. ""I think it's wonderful what they've done, helping so many A-listers who previously had no chance of being a functional part of show business, let alone society at large,"" said foundation donor and Paramount Pictures chairman Brad Grey, adding that he has personally and professionally come into contact with hundreds of developmentally disabled Hollywood performers over the years. ""I have seen firsthand how they've helped my friend Jon [Voight], and the results are astonishing."" Shining Star staffer Pamela Irwin, 33, acknowledged that while her work is incredibly rewarding, it can also be challenging at times, especially when working with some of the more severely disabled celebrities. Many, she claimed, have extremely underdeveloped social skills that make it difficult for them to participate in simple conversations or red-carpet interviews. ""It used to be a real challenge bringing some of the special-needs celebrities we work with, such as Richard Gere, to movie premieres or press junkets,"" said Irwin, noting the high number of mentally challenged film directors, from Brett Ratner to Penny Marshall.

1497,Nation Still Reeling From Mega-Success Of 'Mr. Popper's Penguins',"WASHINGTON'The nation's 300 million citizens announced Saturday that they are still walking around in a collective awe-inspired daze from the phenomenal blockbuster movie Mr. Popper's Penguins, which in its 13-month run has grossed $312 billion, made Carla Gugino Hollywood's top-paid actress, spawned a No. 1'rated spin-off series on the CW, and inspired 200 million downloads of the ""Where's It Poppin?"" smartphone app, which directs users to the closest screening of the movie.

Says Man Putting Down Swamp Thing Comic To Answer Phone Call From Wife","MILWAUKEE'Local man Todd Bogen, 32, reportedly expressed mild annoyance Saturday, muttering, ""Jesus, what it is it now?"" in response to being interrupted by an incoming phone call from his wife while trying to read Swamp Thing Vol. 3: The Curse. ""For Christ's sake,"" said Bogen, holding his finger in place in issue 39, where Swamp Thing is decapitated by a humanoid fish monster, before answering the call from the woman he married in 2009. ""I do not have time to deal with this crap."" ""Ugh, it's always something,"" added Bogen, who released a long exasperated sigh and shook his head, alternately staring at the cell phone clutched in his hand and the cover of the trade paperback containing issues 35 through 42 of Alan Moore's Swamp Thing run. At approximately 2:30 p.m., sources confirmed, Bogen curtly answered the call from his wife, Stacey, with a terse ""What's up?"" Speaking brusquely, he then attempted to get through the conversation as quickly as possible in order to continue reading about how Swamp Thing destroyed a sunken town populated by underwater vampires. Although several minutes earlier Bogen had been concentrating on a five-panel sequence in which a vampire captures and noisily consumes a rat, the 32-year-old sharply informed the woman he loves and is committed to spending his life with that he was ""a little busy."" ""What do you need?' Bogen snapped at his wife, eager to revisit artists Stephen Bissette and John Totleben's depiction of Swamp Thing's consciousness spreading into and controlling all of the nearby botanical life. ""Make it quick, though. I need to get going."" Throughout the brief phone call, Bogen repeatedly said ""uh-huh"" as he scanned the story that showed Swamp Thing ripping gigantic, finger-like roots from the earth and causing the lake to empty out and wash away the vampires in a rush of water. ""Yes, I am listening,"" added Bogen, focusing entirely on Alan Moore's prose, which switched the point of view to the pained thoughts of the vampires as the surging water peeled the rotted flesh from their skeletons. ""Of course I want to hear about it."" ""Tell me when you get home,"" Bogen added. After being asked if he wanted anything from the grocery store, Bogen reportedly skipped ahead in the book to a splash page featuring Swamp Thing kissing Abby Cable and bluntly told his wife, ""I don't care, just get whatever,"" before mentioning that she should pick up some more chips. According to reports, Bogen ended the call by saying, ""Yeah, yeah, yeah, okayEEI'll talk to you later,""losely examining the image of a skeleton entangled in telephone lines, and grunting an affirmation of his love. He then put down the phone and resumed calmly reading the collection of comics he has read at least five times previously. Sources confirmed that later that night Bogen received another call from his wife and pretended he had been sleeping when he had really been watching Firefly on Netflix..e","entertainment, comics, news, vol 48 issue 28, entertainment"
1520,Katie Holmes Glad She Can Finally Practice Scientology In Peace,"NEW YORK'Speaking publicly for the first time since her divorce, Katie Holmes told reporters Friday that her separation from Tom Cruise has at long last given her the chance to immerse herself completely in the practice of Scientology without the intense media scrutiny that comes with being married to one of the church's most famous members. The actress, mother of one, and devoted Scientologist said that while she was grateful to share a belief system with Cruise, the Mission: Impossible star's high position within the church and busy acting career often made it difficult for her to study the works of L. Ron Hubbard with the full attention and religious fervor they deserve. ""I can't tell you how good it feels to just walk into a Scientology center, sit down at Sunday service, and recite the Creed of the Church like a regular person,' said Holmes, explaining that when she attended with Cruise she was forced to make small talk with prominent church members instead of focusing on Standard Tech. ""Sometimes you just want to have your thetan levels measured in the privacy of your own auditing room without all the fuss, you know?"" ""Tom is one of the most passionate and committed Scientologists I know, and that's something I've always admired about him,"" she added. ""But frankly, all that attention made it almost impossible for me to quietly slip into a chapel for a couple hours, commune with the Eighth Dynamic, and reread The Way To Happiness in peace."" Offering a litany of her frustrations, Holmes told reporters that with her husband's busy shooting schedule, she found it hard to fit in more than two or three hours of auditing per week, which she claimed just isn't enough for someone like herself who is totally committed to moving up the Bridge to Total Freedom. In addition, Holmes said Cruise's A-list status often brought the couple into direct contact with numerous Suppressive Persons, who the actress claimed were actively trying to subvert her goal of spreading the Scientology movement worldwide. ""Tom's career and the nonstop media attention surrounding our marriage were extraordinarily disruptive for me and my faith,"" said Holmes, adding that with her divorce proceedings concluded she now hopes to devote the extra time she has to achieving Clear. ""I got through it by remembering LRH's words: 'The whole agonized future of this planet, every man, woman and child on it, and your own destiny for the next endless trillions of years depend on what you do here and now with and in Scientology.'"" Of particular concern to Holmes was the future of the couple's 6-year-old daughter, Suri, who Holmes was worried might not receive the intensive Scientologist education she required. ""Someday, Suri might want to join Sea Org, or spend 1 or 2 billion years working at Gold Base,"" Holmes said. ""Trapped in a pampered celebrity existence, she would never get to have that experience. And what kind of a life would that be? I want to make sure Suri's life, like mine, is fully devoted to ridding her thetan of engrams, passing through the Wall of Fire, and achieving complete control over matter, energy, space, and time. This is something I have to do as a mother."" Holmes is scheduled to make one of her first major public appearances as a newly single woman at a gala ""Psychiatry Kills"" event Friday night in Manhattan.","entertainment, celebrities, news, vol 48 issue 28, entertainment"
1521,New Comic Features Aquaman As 45-Year-Old Single Father To Troubled Flounder,"NEW YORK'In what many are calling the publisher's most dramatic relaunch to date, DC Comics released on Wednesday the first issue of a new Aquaman series that depicts the underwater superhero as a 45-year-old single father struggling to raise a troubled flounder. ""Written by acclaimed writer Scott Snyder, this new series really captures the depths of Aquaman's character as he agonizes over his flounder wife abandoning the family and then learns that being primary caregiver to a juvenile-delinquent fish is the most difficult challenge in all the seven seas,"" said DC comics editor-in-chief Bob Harras, adding that the middle-aged Aquaman and his flounder son share a cramped apartment in a rough area of Atlantis. ""Aquaman, whose super strength and powers have faded with age, must summon all his telepathic abilities to get through to the violent and aggressive young flounder, who is expelled from school after attacking an ornate cowfish."" Harras confirmed that an upcoming storyline would involve Aquaman learning his troubled son was actually fathered by a young Black Manta.","entertainment, comics, news in brief, vol 48 issue 28, entertainment"

""With my storefront rent at $3,600 per month and inventory running another $1,500 on top of that, I really should have been out on the street years ago,"" said Moore, adding that even on a good day he sees no more than 20 customers, tops. ""I mean, I'm not exactly selling luxury cars here. My main customer base is 12-year-old kids who stop by once a week to spend their allowance on a $3.99 comic book.

1525,"'Dark Knight Rises' Opts For Lighthearted, Cartoonish Tone","It's Fun, Like A Comic Book,' Says Christopher Nolan HOLLYWOOD, CA'Stating that ""the time has come for a tonal shift"" in the blockbuster series, director Christopher Nolan announced Thursday that the forthcoming Batman film The Dark Knight Rises would take a lighter, more humorous tone than its predecessors, and would be filled with ""slapstick, primary colors, and just plain old fun."" ""I was somewhat happy with the first two films'probing the psychological landscape of Gotham from an adult perspective is sort of neat, if you like that kind of thing,"" Nolan told reporters at a promotional event. ""But then I realized, 'Hey, what am I doing? Batman is a superhero. Superheroes are supposed to be fun and for kids.' So this time around, I wanted to make something nice and light and simple, because people aren't looking for a civics lesson with Batman. They just want some pleasant, mindless diversion."" ""After all, we're talking about a comic-book movie here,"" Nolan added. ""Let's lighten things up a bit, shall we?"" According to Nolan, in early script meetings for the sequel, proposed plot threads tended to focus on familiar themes of the pained inner life of Bruce Wayne/Batman, his complicated relationship with Gotham law enforcement, the depraved nihilism of the city's criminal element, and the crushing weight of his traumatic memory of his parents' murder. However, Nolan said, he soon grew weary of the treatment's often somber and starkly realistic tone, and opted instead to focus on the fact that Batman comes from an ""enjoyable little picture book"" and should therefore not be approached with such grave solemnity. ""It hit me all of a sudden that comic books are really just silly and frivolous things, and that the people who read them are primarily children or fun-loving adults who are looking for a cheery, good old-fashioned romp,"" Nolan said. ""I mean, it's Batman, for God's sake, not Richard III. We should just go goofy with it. And so we did."" The film's screenplay, co-written with veteran film and television writer Lorenzo Semple Jr., reportedly concerns a coalition of villains who form a ""Batman Revenge Society."" The groups aims to murder Batman (Christian Bale) with, at various times, a plummeting steel safe, jets of cyanide gas concealed in a stuffed moose head, a trapdoor over a shark tank, a beautifully wrapped but ticking gift box, a gorilla trained to go berserk when it sees Batman, a sexy but ungrounded female robot, and a Rube Goldberg'style contraption that, roughly 90 seconds after activation, propels a whirling buzz saw blade into the midsection of whoever is standing on a painted bull's-eye target. ""I feel like I really went back to Batman's roots and discovered the character's true essence,"" Nolan said. ""And that essence turned out to be in the Batman comics from 1940 through 1970, the 1960s Adam West series, the 1970s Super Friends episodes, the actually quite enjoyable films of Joel Schumacher, and Batman's cameo appearances on Scooby-Doo. These were my creative touchstones as I completed my trilogy."" Nolan promised the new film would whisk children of all ages into the fun four-color world of Gotham City, and delight them with whimsical surprises, including an extended car chase through a paint factory, zoo, and outdoor wedding; a new Batmobile whose onboard computer is programmed with a childlike personality able to honk its horn to signal approval or retreat into an alley when scared; and a humorous subplot concerning the inability of Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) to get a Murphy bed to stay down. The director also said Rises would be the ""most merchandisable"" Batman film in years, and he promised a vast array of licensed tie-ins, from infant onesies and light-up children's shoes to an expansion module for the Lego Batman video game and a special Dark Knight Rises edition of Monopoly featuring all the zany locations and characters from the film. ""Best of all, there will be absolutely none of the confusing moral ambiguity that dragged down The Dark Knight,"" Nolan said. ""People don't want all that pompous 'Who's the real monster, Batman or the criminals he pursues?' junk. They want to see the Joker get a big sockeroo on the chin and get tangled up in a net. That's classic funny-book entertainment."" ""Needless to say, no one could ever replace Heath Ledger as the Joker,"" Nolan added, ""but I have to say that Rob Schneider stepped up like a pro. He's just naturally funny and a real cutup, which is what you want in the Joker."" Nolan confirmed he is open to continuing the franchise indefinitely on an accelerated pace of up to one feature per year, ""as long as people keep going to see them,"" and he has asked fans to participate in a DC Comics online poll to select the next film's villains. ""As long as I get to give the movie-going public the whiz-bang action and goofy comedy they crave, I'm artistically satisfied,"" he added. Opening July 20, The Dark Knight Rises stars Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, and the yet-to-be-announced winner of the Nickelodeon/Capri Sun ""I Wanna Co-star with Batman"" Sweepstakes as either Robin or Batgirl.","entertainment, comics, news, vol 48 issue 28, entertainment"

1527,Comic-Con Once Again Marred By Increasingly Popular Bully-Con,"SAN DIEGO'Sources confirmed Tuesday the comic book and sci-fi expo Comic-Con was once again tarnished by the presence of the increasingly popular Bully-Con, a brutal event held simultaneously in the same convention space and attended by some of the nation's most die-hard fans of pummeling nerds. Now in its fifth year, Bully-Con reportedly drew more than 125,000 tormentors of all stripes to the San Diego Convention Center, many of whom said that for people really into making life miserable for those weaker than themselves, there was nothing quite like the massive four-day gathering. 'I don't necessarily have to travel to San Diego to slap a copy of Spider-Man out of some pussy's hands, but there's something special about coming together with thousands of people who really dig the same sort of cruelty you do,' said Houston-area goon Marty Badolato, adding that he quickly made half a dozen new friends while shoving people exiting a Q&A with Tick creator Ben Edlund. 'It just blew my mind to be in a single building completely surrounded by so many people making nerds flinch.' 'And check out the cool swag,' added Badolato, holding up two halves of an autographed photo of Star Trek actress Nichelle Nichols that he had torn up moments after a fan had gotten the signature. 'I've got a tote bag filled with stuff like this.' In just a few short years, Bully-Con has grown from a small group of thugs roaming the Comic-Con exhibition halls in search of geeks to harass as they peruse fantasy miniatures into a phenomenon in its own right. This year's installment featured more than 200 breakout sessions, including a workshop on headlock technique, a retrospective look at the history of menacingly whispering 'faggot,' and a seminar on Japanese ijime bullying, which in the past decade has become tremendously popular in the United States. The centerpiece of this year's event was an all-star panel discussion in which celebrated bullies past and present offered advice on how to go to the Comic-Con panel on The Walking Dead and absolutely ruin it. 'When we started this, it was just me and a couple of friends who wanted to taunt some Joss Whedon fans,' said Bully-Con co-founder Chet Olsen, who told reporters he never imagined he and 300 fellow bullies would one day heckle the host of a Firefly trivia contest to the point of tears, or push writer Matt Fraction down a hill behind the convention center. 'It's so much bigger than that now, and while I'm proud of my contribution, a lot of the credit goes to ordinary bullies who travel out here from around the country.' 'Well, them and all the dorks,' Olsen added. 'It wouldn't be any fun without those little shits.' Indeed, over time, Comic-Con has become almost as well-known for the colorful costumes of its attendees as for the scheduled convention events themselves, an element Bully-Con attendees said had become a huge part of the experience for them as well. 'It's fun to sneak up behind people dressed as Boba Fett, rip the helmet off, and leave them standing there with their dumb heads sticking out of body armor,' said bully Rod Fitzgerald, adding that his girlfriend was also a bully and loved telling girls dressed like Kate Beckinsale's Underworld character that anyone as fat and disgusting as they were had a lot of nerve wearing skin-tight leather. 'I've been coming to Bully-Con since the beginning, and going up to some dweeb in robes and glasses, and twisting his arm until he screams, 'My name is Homo Potter!' just never gets old.' Fitzgerald smiled and added, 'Man, I can't wait until October for New York Bully-Con.'","entertainment, comic-con, our annual year 2012, comics, news, vol 48 issue 28, entertainment"

1530,Economically Healthy 'Daily Planet' Now Most Unrealistic Part Of Superman Universe,"NEW YORK'Frustrated fans of the Superman comic book said Monday the continued financial stability and cultural relevance of the series' Daily Planet newspaper is now the most unrealistic part of its universe and an annoying distraction that has ruined their reading experience. While they acknowledged that enjoying the adventures of a superhero who can fly, lift a bus over his head, and shoot beams of intense heat from his eyes requires some suspension of disbelief, longtime fans told reporters they simply could not accept a daily metropolitan newspaper still thriving in the media landscape of 2012. ""I can play along with Superman using a steel girder to swat someone into outer space, but I just can't get past the idea that The Daily Planet still occupies one of the largest skyscrapers in all of Metropolis and is totally impervious to newsroom layoffs or dwindling home subscriptions,"" said comics blogger Marc Daigle, adding that it was impossible for him to even look at Superman's alter ego, Clark Kent, without immediately thinking he would have been replaced long ago by a freelancer who gets paid nine cents a word and receives no health benefits. ""Every time The Daily Planet shows up, I just get taken out of the story completely. I usually flip ahead to Superman freezing a volcano with his breath or something."" ""I'm not saying The Daily Planet has to be an entirely accurate depiction of a media anachronism that no longer has a single reliable revenue stream,"" Daigle added. ""But, come on, don't insult us."" Other fans said The Daily Planet'which for some strange reason has not been acquired by multimillionaire Lex Luthor with a promise to give readers shorter articles with more sizzle'is so deeply woven into the Superman universe that they had no choice but to avoid the comic altogether. They said even the most exciting stories are routinely marred by absurd depictions of a publication that somehow flourishes in print and whose millions of loyal readers seem oblivious to the idea of getting news online faster and for free. ""I can totally buy into an epic battle in which Superman claps his hands and creates a sonic boom that sends Darkseid flying through 50 buildings,"" lifelong reader Richard Taft said. ""But as soon as people start lining up at newsstands to read about it in The Daily Planet, I think, 'Doesn't anyone have a computer at work? Are there no smartphones?'

""The least they could do is have [Daily Planet editor-in-chief] Perry White be forced into retirement by an MBA 25 years his junior,"" Taft continued. ""It'd be a start."" Lou Wadlow, owner of a Boston-area comic-book store, said the outright ridiculousness of The Daily Planet not putting up a pay wall in a futile attempt to remain profitable is causing the popular comic to lose readers, especially younger ones. ""The kids will flip through a copy of Superman, roll their eyes, and put it right back on the rack,"" Wadlow said.

1532,George Clooney Beginning To Think He Should Buy His Own Tuxedo,"LOS ANGELES'Saying he didn't want to go overboard but thought it would be a pretty good investment considering his line of work, veteran actor George Clooney told reporters Wednesday he's been thinking about just going ahead and buying his own tuxedo. 'At first I thought I wouldn't need one, but I walk into a rental store around 175 times a year, and even the guys there say, 'Why don't you just buy one already?'' Clooney told People magazine, explaining that he spent more than $300,000 last year renting the same black Giorgio Armani. 'That makes sense, because I'd get a lot of mileage out of it, and after a while, it would probably pay for itself. Maybe I'll wait and see if I get invited to the Oscars this year, just in case.' Clooney added that because he travels so frequently, he is also considering buying a car instead of using a bus pass.","entertainment, george clooney, news in brief, vol 48 issue 27, entertainment"

1534,Keith Richards' Housekeeper Has Braced Herself For Finding Dead Body Every Morning Since 1976,"WESTON, CT'Since her first day on the job in October 1976, Keith Richards' housekeeper Rosemary Velasquez, 64, has mentally and emotionally prepared herself every single day to find the hard-living Rolling Stones guitarist lying dead somewhere in his home. ""Each morning before I leave for work, I look in the mirror, take a deep breath, and think to myself, 'Rosemary, you could very well find Keith Richards' dead body today,"" Velasquez told reporters Thursday, adding that from the moment she was first hired by a ""nearly comatose"" Richards, she began steeling herself for the inevitable discovery of the guitarist's wiry corpse in his bedroom or kitchen. ""It's never been a question of if I would find him dead, but where and how soon."" Velasquez said her workday begins as she pulls into Richards' driveway and braces herself for the potential sight of his stark-naked cadaver sprawled out on his front lawn. From there, after gathering her supplies, she takes a quick peek into the backyard, where she fears she will find Richards floating lifelessly face down in his swimming pool. The housekeeper said that as she goes about her work, she takes a moment to collect herself before opening every door and pulling back each shower curtain. If a door is locked, she noted, she leaves it be and prays it's not locked the next day. According to Velasquez, anytime she smells an odor other than alcohol or stale cigarette smoke, she immediately imagines a scenario in which the odor gets stronger and stronger, leading her to a closet with a week-old dead body inside. ""In the late '70s, especially, there were a few close calls where I would find little droplets of Mr. Richards' blood leading to his bedroom, and I would tell myself, 'Today is the day,'"" Velasquez said. ""He'd usually be lying there with a needle sticking out of his arm, but somehow he would always still be breathing. So I would call an ambulance."" ""I've had to call 911 at least 30 times since I started working here,"" she added. ""I have to admit, over the years there's been a lot more gunplay around this place than I'd care for."" Besides resigning herself to one day discovering Richards' corpse, the housekeeper of 36 years said she has also remained alert to the possibility of stumbling across the dead bodies of his bandmates and friends. She confirmed there have been several mornings on which she's found a heap of naked bodies in the living room, all belonging to people who were unconscious but not dead. In addition, during the mid-'80s Velasquez reportedly had to check for Rolling Stones drummer Charlie Watts' heartbeat so many times she memorized every place on the human body where it is possible to check for a pulse. ""It's a lot of anxiety to go through on a daily basis,"" she said, mentioning times when she was certain shouting matches between Richards and former girlfriend Anita Pallenberg would lead to the housekeeper finding either Richards, Pallenberg, or both murdered or dead as a result of some bizarre suicide pact. ""When I leave each evening, I worry that Mr. Richards will forget he turned the oven on, or that he'll drink too much, or that he'll have a relapse, or that his heart will just stop."" Added Velasquez, ""There are just so many ways for this man to die."" Even though Richards is no longer the heavy drug user he once was, Velasquez said the likelihood of finding him dead today is probably about the same as it was in the 1970s. ""Mr. Richards is old enough now he could die from natural causes, which is a possibility I never would have imagined 30 years ago,"" the housekeeper said. ""Personally, I kind of wish he would just die already, because his lifestyle has certainly taken its toll on my health."" At the end of her interview, Velasquez paused a while to gather herself, saying, ""Well, it's time for me to go to work.""","entertainment, celebrities, drugs, news, vol 48 issue 27, entertainment"

1544,I Think I'd Make A Pretty Good HBO Show,"I don't think I'm talking out of turn here when I say that, as far as historical eras are concerned, I am probably one of the richest and most exciting periods in Western history. That's not me bragging; it's just a generally accepted truth at this point. After all, not every century of a nation's past can boast successive international wars, a radical intellectual movement, and a bloody revolution, but I've got all of that and then some. In fact, one would be pretty hard-pressed to find a period more compelling and ripe for gripping drama than myself. Which is why, when you think about it, it's pretty crazy there hasn't been an HBO original series about me about by now. Something like 40,000 people were beheaded during me, for God's sake. Put that into a made-for-TV drama that weaves a rich tapestry of historical narrative with gritty tales of intrigue, murder, and sex, and I'm pretty much an untapped gold mine of programming, right? I know, I know, everyone and their mother thinks they have a great idea for a cable television show, but stick with me on this one. Between sprawling aristocratic estates juxtaposed with sordid underworlds and political upheaval driven by ambitious but flawed political figures, I can deliver the full HBO package. You want elegant costumes? Check. Candelabras? Check. Beautiful women with moles? Check and check. I'm packed full of cool stuff. You could slot me in on, say, Sunday nights at nine and probably get a 2.5 Nielsen rating, easy. Look, here's the first episode: A prominent but crooked nobleman hires a cash-strapped young libertine to ruin the innocent daughter of a politically outspoken peasant against the backdrop of Robespierre's Reign of Terror. Boom. That took me five seconds. I'm just going to free associate now on some of the things you could see in an HBO show about me: a boar hunt in the verdant French countryside, a corseted young woman riding in an ornate gilded carriage through crowded Parisian streets, a stately duke applying his powdered wig in the morning with the help of his trusted footman. Seriously, tell me when to stop, because I can do this all night. By the way, did I mention that I, 18th-century France, was a patriarchal society teeming with illegal brothels and prostitution? There's your gratuitous sex scenes for the first five episodes right there. Cast-wise, off the top of my head, I'm thinking GŽrard Depardieu would pretty much be a given for me. You could probably get Selma Blair to play a beautiful young prostitute with royal ties in my prerevolutionary years'she could pass for French, no problem. Marion Cotillard would obviously be a tough get for a series regular, but I'm sure she'd do a cameo or two as a duchess or something. Throw in a little Tom Wilkinson as a Girondin sympathizer and Jean Reno as a wily beggar with revolutionary leanings, and you've got yourself a series. I can already envision the cast posing on the cover of Rolling Stone, goofing around with a prop guillotine under a headline like, ""Sacrebleu! It's a hit!"" It's almost too perfect, really. And I think HBO is the right home for me, too. I feel like the other pay cable networks would not be able nail the period detail stuff as well, and basic cable just feels sort of cheap in a way, which I was anything but. I like HBO's track record. Michael Lombardo has made some smart programming choices lately, and I think he'd be sympathetic to my appeal to a young female demographic. Women have always been entranced by my mix of visual opulence and high intrigue. I don't mean to generalize, but it's true. Oh! Just thought of something amazing. Maybe they could do some kind of cool narrative maneuver wherein NapolŽon Bonaparte is just a peripheral character quietly introduced halfway through the first season, but then as the political drama unfolds, he's deftly laced into a primary story arc, and we see how his life intersects with one of the lower-class characters. Might be good. And also, all that NapolŽon stuff only started happening right at the end of me. Go back a ways and you'll find some wars with Austria and England, the reign of Louis XIV, an influx of immigrants inviting cultural fears of the unknown, and the Enlightenment, which shattered preconceptions about religion, science, and sex. That's more than enough material for a sharp TV writer'maybe one of the Deadwood guys, if possible'to set up character backgrounds and introduce themes that resonate with our current political and cultural landscape, like the rise of oppressive political leaders amid widespread social and economic decline. Honestly, should I just pitch a treatment? Why not, right?","opinion, entertainment, commentary, vol 48 issue 25, 18th-century france, entertainment"

1547,Americans Enjoying 3 Months Of Vegging Out Before Responsibilities Of Fall Programming Resume,"WASHINGTON'Saying they just need to relax after a ""grueling"" nine months of watching television, Americans across the nation are reportedly using the summer to recuperate before they take on the demanding responsibility of 2012's fall programming lineup. U.S. residents said that because the upcoming television season will require long hours of tireless viewing that will keep them up until 11 p.m. most nights, they plan on taking the next three months off so they can start fresh in September. ""Between Game Of Thrones, a new season of Mad Men, and the final season of House, not to mention dozens of sitcoms and reality shows, this year's been a real grind,"" 38-year-old Omaha, NE resident William Bell said Sunday, adding that if he's going to do a good job watching television this fall, he needs to just zone out this summer. ""I'll worry about how I'm going to watch the newest episode of Castle while simultaneously playing catch up with Hawaii Five-0 later. But right now, I'm going to kick back, relax, and think about nothing for a while."" ""I'm definitely going to sleep,"" Bell added. ""A lot."" Americans said that in order to fulfill their television-watching duties to the best of their abilities, they're going to need 12 weeks of vegging out on the couch and not concerning themselves with which show is on next or how many unwatched programs are building up on their DVRs. Moreover, the U.S. populace told reporters it's better in the long run to use the summer to take it easy and rest, because once the new season begins there can be no breaks or vacations. ""I'm going to come back ready to put everything'absolutely everything'into watching television, but right now I need this,"" said Fairfax, VA resident Ben Nichols, who, after viewing the season finale of Modern Family, made plans to lay back in a comfortable chair for a few weeks, eat junk food, and ""clear [his] head."" ""Actually, no. I deserve it."" According to a recent Gallup poll, 35 percent of Americans are just going to take it ""super easy"" so they can come back to television re-energized and ready to go; 20 percent said that if they don't take a break now, they'll more than likely burn out by the time midseason replacements begin airing; and 45 percent aren't planning to even look at a television for the next three months, unless a show they want to watch is on. Amanda Wurster, a physical therapist in San Francisco, said she was looking forward to lounging around and spacing out after months of staying up late every night to finish watching television shows. ""It can get pretty tough, especially if you push yourself too hard,"" Wurster, 32, said of watching television. ""You think it will only be four hours a day, but because you feel an obligation to go the extra mile by reading reviews of all the shows, watching behind-the-scenes clips about the making of certain episodes, and downloading special online-only webisodes, that four hours turns into eight, and eight turns into 12, and then just like that you're behind."" ""It'll be great not to have to come home from work and immediately turn on the TV,"" Wurster added. ""I was so busy during sweeps I barely saw my boyfriend."" While a majority of citizens told reporters they would take advantage of the break, others said that to remain sharp they plan to double-down on their television watching, either by viewing repeat episodes or watching DVDs of old programs such as M*A*S*H or Night Court. ""Yes, I'm exhausted, but if I take three months off, I'll just be rusty come September, and personally, I feel you need to be hitting on all cylinders right from the beginning,"" Dearborn, MI resident George Carol, 43, said. ""If I don't maintain that intense, day-in-day-out schedule, I know I'll slip. And then there'll be a new episode of Fringe on and instead of really watching it, I'll just sort of sit in front of my TV and go through the motions."" Added Carol, 'I'd really hate for season premieres to start and feel like I haven't given myself the best possible chance to be successful.'","entertainment, news, vol 48 issue 25, entertainment"

1558,Peter Jackson Opens Up About His Personal Hobbit Friends In Beginnings Of Genius Marketing Campaign Or Full-On Mental Breakdown,"LOS ANGELES'Either deploying a brilliant strategy to spur excitement for his forthcoming adaptation of The Hobbit or completely losing his grip on reality, filmmaker Peter Jackson told reporters Sunday about the many hobbits with whom he enjoys personal friendships. ""It was such a delight to return to the Shire and work with all my marvelous hobbit friends again,"" said Jackson, who may have been introducing a daring new kind of marketing campaign or may have experienced a major psychotic break. ""These are the guys I spent years with when we were making The Lord Of The Rings, so we're almost like family at this point."" ""Bilbo, of course, is as hale as ever, and seeing Frodo for a couple days was a rare treat,"" an enthusiastic Jackson either playfully or chillingly told members of the Hollywood press. ""They're my little best friends."" When asked to clarify how his two-part Hobbit series would differ from the original book, the Academy Award winner immediately answered that it would have ""many, many more hobbits."" Jackson, whether going totally off the deep end or making a bold attempt to generate press for his films, went on to speak of his affection and deep respect for Blandroot Took, Summerstorm Bolger, Hardtoe Gamwich, and numerous other members of the completely fictional race first imagined in the 1930s by author J.R.R. Tolkien. A question about what it was like to work with actor Sir Ian Holm again was met with scowling silence until a reporter reworded the question, referring to Holm as ""Bilbo."" ""I have a few [hobbits] at my house right now,"" said Jackson, continuing his brilliant publicity coup or alarming disconnect from reality. ""There's dear old Primrose Brandybuck, the finest potter north of Sackville, and Clotho Proudfoot, the baker, who is simply a wonderful chef. The aromas from his superlative dishes fill my house day and night."" ""Did I show you the birthday card I got from Bilbo this year?"" added Jackson, holding up a pile of leaves. ""He always remembers to send one. He's a very special hobbit."" In a statement that could have been orchestrated by New Line Cinema or could be symptomatic of severe clinical paranoia, Jackson lamented that the entire thriving community of hobbits would cease to exist by the end of the Fourth Age, when they would be ""overrun by the brutish Big People with their filthy, noisy machines."" Sunday's interview comes a week after a New Zealand talk show appearance in which the acclaimed director insisted upon being called ""Jackson the Green,"" held aloft a yardstick with a tin can on one end, and defied any critic who questioned his interpretation of Tolkien's works to ""take up a staff of power and meet [him] in Isengard"" to duel atop the tower of Orthanc. Reached for comment, friends and longtime collaborators applauded Jackson's commitment to his craft. ""The thing about Peter is that he really, really loves these books and has dedicated himself to taking what's on the page and bringing it to life, so to speak,"" said Elijah Wood, who briefly reprises his role as Frodo in the Hobbit films and neglected to confirm whether Jackson had developed a brilliant new marketing tactic or a profound mental illness. ""It's a big part of who he is. A very big part.""

1569,"Shadows Meet The Clouds, Gray On Gray, Like Dusty Charcoal On An Ashen Brow, Nation's Poets Report","NEW YORK'According to a growing consensus of U.S. poets, shadows'inky sharp as a raven's beak'meet the sullen bloat of clouds, their hues a pallid loam, each a dancer, each alone, like dusty charcoal on an ashen brow. Citing both the ageless gloom of morning and a weary sun, its astral luminescence wrapped in arid gauze, the nation's poets told reporters this week that doubt lingers in the frail minutes of a young dawn, adding that said doubt was a heathen doubt'a father's doubt'untouched by faith. Multiple verse-writing sources also confirmed vapors, milky white vapors of shallow breath from a child's lips. ""I take the cloth of fog, I drape it over'gently, like a midwife'the memory of one broken holy Friday,"" poet K. Martin Echols said during a press conference Tuesday. ""Hallowed be regret, and hallowed be my hands across the table where we ate, where we wept, where we fought the laws of bliss like lovers."" ""For what is the sound of hope?

""It would be nice to have some indication that my messages about friendship and sharing are being heard rather than have a pack of totally silent, open-mouthed 6-year-olds stare unblinkingly at my shiny wheels for an hour. It creeps me out."" Thomas the Tank Engine's comments come on the heels of the controversy surrounding Sesame Street's Snuffleupagus, who last month incensed gay rights groups after saying that he was confused and somewhat disturbed by his massive, rabid homosexual following.","entertainment, kids, our annual year 2012, news in brief, vol 48 issue 21, entertainment"

""Now that we've closed the books on yet another thrilling criminal investigation, it's time to solve the mystery of just what you guys would tune in to if you had your pick,"" said Law And Order: Special Victims Unit's Mariska Hargitay, flanked by co-star Danny Pino, who stopped arresting the episode's prime suspect, waved to the audience, and said, ""Hi there. Did you like this episode of television? Would you like to see something else instead, either in place of us or in place of something else?"" Pino was then joined by the rest of the cast as well as NBC Chairman Robert Greenblatt, who shook hands with all the actors before introducing himself and addressing viewers. ""Good evening. How about a three-camera family sitcom? A hospital drama? Some kind of musical contest thing, maybe? Really, don't be shy; we just need to know what it is you want so we can make more money and be a better company. Please email your suggestions to viewervoices@nbc.com and try to be as detailed as possible when explaining the type of programming you'd like to see. Have a good night.""

""And to be totally honest, I almost always skip that track with the mother kissing her baby. It's like, 'Who cares?' you know?"" Ellinger said he plans on taking a few things he likes off the record'such as the traditional Peruvian wedding song, the humpback whale calls, and the tractor noises'and throwing them on a mix with some Elvis Costello classics.","entertainment, science, music, space, dispatch, news in brief, vol 48 issue 20, entertainment"

'A lot of the big crowd scenes in season two really depleted the available pool of greasy-haired bearded actors over 70, and for the sake of continuity we can't really reuse them,' executive producer D.B. Weiss said Monday, stressing the importance of having a minimum of one new elderly and disheveled male character in every episode of the epic drama. 'I honestly don't know what we're going to do. In the third season, we have at least a dozen war room meetings to film, and you can't shoot a war room meeting without having at least two or three poorly groomed old guys with big, tangly beards hanging around.' The Game Of Thrones crisis is the latest in a series of casting woes to beleaguer HBO, which in March announced it had already used up its annual allocation of Steve Buscemi.","entertainment, game of thrones, tv, news in brief, vol 48 issue 20, entertainment"

1593,$80 Million Movie Scrapped After Footage Reveals Brad Pitt Had Spinach Stuck In Teeth For Entire Film,"LOS ANGELES'Director Andrew Dominik announced Saturday that he was forced to scrap a new $80 million motion picture after reviewing footage and finding that the film's star, Brad Pitt, had a piece of spinach wedged between his front teeth throughout the three-month shoot. 'It's unfortunate, because Brad's performance was so great,' said Dominik, explaining that the spinach was visible in every scene in which Pitt opens his mouth. 'We tried to salvage it by adding a brief prologue before the credits where he's eating a bowl of spinach, but it's still too distracting, particularly because of all the scenes where his fellow actors rub their tongues over their teeth and slyly point at their mouths.' Earlier in postproduction, Dominik noticed that Mary-Louise Parker had mustard smeared on her face, but that problem was quickly solved by digitally inserting hot dogs into her hands every time she appeared on screen.","brad pitt, entertainment, news in brief, vol 48 issue 19, entertainment"

'Most people don't know this was the way Walt Disney envisioned it, but every one of these films takes place in the same interconnected universe,' said Schroeder, explaining that Never Never Land is only five minutes away from the coral reef where Nemo lives along with Daryl Hannah's character from Splash.' 'The plot of the The Lion King may not be happening at the same time as Aladdin, but those characters are all there in that world while it's going on. Of course, if the filmmakers had been so inclined, they could have had Jasmine hop into Herbie Fully Loaded and speed through Pride Rock on her way to see the Jonas Brothers' 3D Concert Experience'that is, if she didn't get tricked by Br'er Rabbit's Tar Baby first.' When asked why more characters didn't cross paths during their adventures, Schroeder responded that filmmakers have approached the collective kingdom rather cautiously ever since Bambi's mother was mistaken for a rabid dog and shot by Travis from Old Yeller.","entertainment, disney, our annual year 2012, news in brief, vol 48 issue 19, entertainment"
1596,Ahmadinejad Kind Of Getting Back Into Old R.E.M. Again,"TEHRAN'Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told reporters Thursday he was kind of getting back into old R.E.M. again, rediscovering his once-great passion for the alternative rock group's first six albums. Ahmadinejad, leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran's conservative political coalition, confirmed that ever since R.E.M. broke up in September 2011, he had been revisiting the Athens, GA band's catalog and was once again really digging its earlier stuff. ""Listening to some of those early albums they did for [record label] I.R.S. has reminded me of how great R.E.M. really was,"" said the 55-year-old former mayor of Tehran, who is known for his rigorous implementation of radical Islamist policies throughout Iran. ""Stipe's cryptic vocals combined with Buck's bright, chiming guitar hooks, Mills' melodic bass lines, and the driving beat of Bill Berry's drums creates this ethereal sound that just completely kicks ass."" ""They're basically like the original alternative rock band,"" the controversial world leader and Holocaust denier added. Ahmadinejad confirmed he first discovered R.E.M. in 1986 after stumbling across Fables Of The Reconstruction on vinyl at a record store in Tehran. At the time a civil engineering graduate student who helped crack down on dissident university professors and pupils, he said he was immediately infatuated with the band upon hearing the haunting guitar riff at the start of album opener ""Feeling Gravitys Pull."" ""I was already into the Replacements, Hüsker Dü, and Pylon, but R.E.M was like the perfect mixture of jangle pop and college rock, plus they had this really atmospheric quality that was all their own,"" said the man the terrorist group al-Qaeda once blasted for spreading conspiracy rumors about the 9/11 attacks. ""You know the thunder effect on 'We Walk'? It's actually the slowed down sound of billiard balls colliding, but with the tape played back at a really slow speed. Pretty cool, right?"" Claiming the Grammy Award'winning band has always been ""super important"" to him as a source of reassurance in tough times, Ahmadinejad told reporters he never would have gotten through the stress of the 2009 Iranian election protests and Green Revolution if he hadn't pulled out his copy of Lifes Rich Pageant and ""just put 'Fall On Me' on repeat."" ""People don't give Lifes Rich Pageant enough credit, but it's really good'really good,"" said the Iranian ruler who has been widely condemned for his human rights record. ""It's a great album to put on when you're traveling. When I went to the U.N. in 2005 to speak about Iran's right to develop nuclear power, I was listening to it all the time."" However, the hardline religious politician admitted to souring on the 1987 R.E.M. release Dead Letter Office, saying he now associates the group's compilation of rarities and B-sides with a later visit to the U.N. in which delegates walked out on an address filled with inflammatory anti-Semitic slurs. Despite his enthusiasm, Ahmadinejad claimed he has had a difficult time getting fellow high-ranking Iranian officials into the band's work. While numerous members of the Islamic Consultative Assembly reportedly enjoyed the intentional campiness of the video for ""Shiny Happy People,"" the majority of the legislative body failed to grasp how the tracks ""Welcome To The Occupation"" and ""Lightnin' Hopkins"" on Document were, in their president's opinion, ""a major leap forward"" for the band's songwriting. Recently, aides confirmed Ahmadinejad's relationship with Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei, who agreed with the president's remarks that Israel should be wiped off the map, had been strained after the ayatollah issued a fatwa declaring R.E.M. had ""totally sold out"" with the release of Green. ""That's such bullshit. Green holds up great,"" Ahmadinejad said. ""He only said that because it's the favorite album of his ex-girlfriend, who dumped him.""","entertainment, politicians, music, our annual year 2012, news, vol 48 issue 19, entertainment"

1649,GLAAD To Honor Any Mainstream Film That Gets One Thing Right About Being Gay,"LOS ANGELES'Seeking to honor filmmakers for fair and inclusive portrayals of the LGBT community, the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation announced Sunday the establishment of a prestigious new prize to be awarded to any mainstream motion picture that gets even one thing right about being gay. ""We're not asking for a two-hour-long pitch-perfect exploration of the gay and lesbian experience'just a single accurate, believable detail that feels in any way telling or true-to-life,"" said GLADD spokesperson Cheryl Weingardt, who promised a major cash prize and high-profile award ceremony to any Hollywood director able to deliver a film'any film at all'that includes a brief on-screen moment in which a gay character seems even somewhat authentic. ""It can be a line of convincing dialogue, an emotionally honest reaction shot. All we ask is that you have someone gay in the frame for a couple seconds without it being completely insulting to the audience's intelligence."" Weingardt added that she hopes her grandchildren will one day see a popular movie in which a gay person's role isn't limited to being the main character's witticism-spewing confidante.","entertainment, gay & lesbian, news in brief, vol 48 issue 08, entertainment"
1650,"Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie Arrive On Oscar Red Carpet 12 Hours Early","We're Just So Happy To Be Here,' Joyful Couple Announces LOS ANGELES'Stepping out of a chauffeured limousine just as dawn broke above Hollywood's Kodak Theatre Sunday morning, Brad Pitt and longtime partner Angelina Jolie arrived at the 84th Annual Academy Awards, taking their place on the red carpet a full 12 hours before the event was scheduled to begin. 'Man oh man, Oscar Sunday! The day I've been waiting for all year has finally arrived, and what a thrill to actually be here in the flesh,' said Pitt, adjusting his bow tie as a single city bus drove down the desolate Hollywood Boulevard. 'Angelina and I were so excited, we bolted up out of bed at four this morning, got dressed, and had the car take us right over.' 'Heck, it's not like we would have been able to go back to sleep anyway,' he added. 'It's the Oscars!' Pitt, who received a nomination for Best Actor for his role in Moneyball, immediately strode right up to the theater's grand entryway, remarking how 'unbelievably psyched' he was to be invited to the biggest night in show business to the small crew of workers groggily erecting the press tent. According to sources, at approximately 8 a.m. the delighted couple began taking multiple laps up and down the empty red carpet, pausing along the way to giggle with excitement and to pretend they were waving at throngs of nonexistent fans screaming their names. A beaming Jolie then reportedly made a series of several slow turns as if a hypothetical pack of photographers was fighting to capture her from every angle. Though she was not nominated for any awards herself, Jolie was hardly able to contain her enthusiasm to her equally elated husband, gushing about how she couldn't wait to see who would be mentioned in host Billy Crystal's opening monologue and what famous celebrities would be presenting awards. 'Just think, all the movie stars are going to be standing right here,' said Jolie, gazing wide-eyed over the sea of collapsed folding chairs, un-built scaffolding, and exposed wires littering the sidewalk. 'All the lights, the cameras, the glamour'I feel like I'm in a dream!' Added Jolie, 'I wonder if we'll see George Clooney.' As a fleet of flatbed trucks arrived to deliver dozens of portable bleachers, Pitt and Jolie decided to walk next door to the Hollywood & Highland center, where the Starbucks had just opened and Jolie could duck into the bathroom to adjust her makeup while Pitt could purchase a coffee and go over his acceptance speech should he win an award. The couple returned just as crews were rolling the giant Oscar statue into place and tilting it upright, prompting Jolie and Pitt to giddily pull out their cell phones and take each other's pictures in front of it. Pitt and Jolie then sat cross legged on the red carpet for 45 minutes, eating the bagged lunches they had packed the night before and marveling at all the bustle going on around them. 'Make sure to take a lot of pictures,' said Pitt to Jolie. 'Oh, and let's try to position ourselves near the limousines at the start so we can see when all the big names arrive.' 'That's my favorite part,' he added. At press time, the couple had reportedly attempted to enter the theater to scope out the best seats, but were informed by security that the doors wouldn't be opening for another six hours.","oscars, brad pitt, entertainment, news, vol 48 issue 08, angelina jolie, entertainment"

1655,I'm Getting Bitten By The Oscar BugEEAGAIN!,"For some people, March Madness begins in March, and it's tied to college basketball, but not me! I start to go mad beginning in December, and it all wraps up right at the beginning of March, or the end of February lately. Of course I'm talking about the glitz, the glamour, the Oscars! And what a season it is this year. Billy ""The Best"" Crystal is back to show all those John Stewarts and Steve Martins how it's done. As far as the films themselves go, there have been so many unexpected surprises, twists, and turns this season that you would need an expert to figure it out. Fortunately, that's where your Humble Hollywood Helper Jackie Harvey comes in. I tried to be fair and see all the movies, as I do every year, but with a schedule like mine, it's not always easy. While I love the book The Giving Tree, I was scared away from the Terrence Malbec movie version after hearing from a lot of people that it was very long. Also, I went to see The Artist, but it was hard for me to see what all the fuss was about. To be fair to the filmmakers, the sound was all messed up at the screening I went to and I couldn't hear any of the dialogue. It's a good thing the leading man was French, so there were subtitles. I mean, not like you needed them. From start to finish, lead Damien Beecher overacted so much that everything was telegraphed. Hey, Damien, it's the Oscars, not the Hammys! But enough about what I haven't seen, or haven't seen well. Let's get this Oscar party started right! Breathe easy, I'll get rid of the elephant in the room right now. For best picture, the obvious choice is Help! Hollywood and I both love a good story about black people and white people helping each other, and Help delivered in spades! Emma Stone delivers a powerhouse performance, Olivia Spencer, who is black, gives a knock-out performance, and the movie has a very powerful message: Don't be racist, and women can make a difference. It gets a little trickier from there. Smart money would put the little statue for Best Actor in George Clooney's oh-so-capable hands for his part in The Descent, since he's only won once, and that was for supporting actor for Syria. Not so fast though, because Jackie Harvey's never been one to take the smart money. My gut tells me that 2012 is the year of Gary Oldman, in part because British actors always have the edge, but also because he was robbed in his turn as Doctor Smith in the sadly overlooked Lost In Space movie. I bet you're ""close"" to figuring out who is going to win for Best Actress in A Leading Role. Keep thinking about it. Getting any ""close-r?"" Well, if you picked Glenn Close, then you're right on the money! With two wins under her belt for Sophie's Choice and Kramer Vs. Kramer, Glenn Close is no stranger to the ceremonies, and her turn as Queen Elizabeth in That Iron Lady was nothing short of amazing. Since Pixar didn't release a movie this year, I'm going to go out on a limb and say that Rango is the best bet for Best Animated Feature. Or maybe Panda Boy 2. Yeah, forget Rango. Pandas are very popular at the moment, what with the looming ecological disaster threatening to make them all extinct. Lizards don't have quite the same cachet since they can live pretty much anywhere, I'm fairly sure. I don't know all the science, really, but put your chips on Panda Boy 2. Now for the Jackie Harvey 2012 Academy Awards Picks For Films That Were Released In 2011 Lightning Round! For Best Actress In A Supporting Role, hands down, Melissa McCartney, because she was so brave. Best Actor In A Supporting Role, Seth Rogen's son Jonah for holding his own against Brad Pitt. And finally, the Academy Award for Best Editing goes to Thelma Schoonmaker, because I could actually follow what was going on in that crazy movie Hugo. Talk about avant-garde! I'd share more of my picks, but I can't give away ALL of my secrets. For all I know, you might be betting against me! Just kidding. ;-P Well, time to wrap things up! I have to go check out a hot lead that Cher has a daughter that had gender reassignment surgery. Come back for that, because you're not gonna want to miss it. Until then, I'll see youEEon the outside! Jackie Harvey graduated from Viterbo University with a degree in English literature in 1990. After honing his writing and copy-editing skills at The Sunshine Shopper, he became The Onion's entertainment columnist in 1994, replacing the outgoing Archie 'Arch' Danielson. Currently, Harvey writes his regular column, ""e Outside Scoop,"" as well as his blog, ""Harveywood!""rr","opinion, entertainment, commentary, vol 48 issue 08, jackie harvey, entertainment"

1660,"Moviegoers Not Interested In Hearing What Is, Isn't Possible, Demand Heath Ledger 'Dark Knight Rises' Appearance","LOS ANGELES'Saying they don't want to hear anything at all about what film producers can or can't do, moviegoers across the country warned Thursday that the latest Batman movie, The Dark Knight Rises, had better include an appearance by the late Heath Ledger as the Joker. The film enthusiasts, who adamantly stated they aren't interested in what is or isn't physically possible within the generally accepted bounds of reality, told reporters they don't care how difficult it might be for director Christopher Nolan to add a scene with the deceased actor, nor do they want to be bothered with the details of how it could happen. The movie studio just needs to figure it out and get it done, they said. ""I don't want to sit here and have an argument about who's alive or who's dead, because, quite frankly, I don't care,"" Boston resident Sean Barksdale, 32, said. ""This is what I want: I want an original scene with original dialogue that features Christian Bale as Batman and Heath Ledger as Joker. And it has to be the real Heath Ledger, too, not someone doing a Heath Ledger impression or I swear to God I'm asking for my money back."" ""It can't be some deleted scene from the last movie, either,"" Barksdale added. ""That doesn't count."" Claiming they weren't interested in getting into an existential conversation about life or metaphysics or anything like that, moviegoers hinted that the film could suffer at the box office without an additional scene'ranging anywhere from 30 seconds to two minutes'that features a living, breathing Heath Ledger. Audiences noted that by submitting their demands in February, they are giving Warner Bros. Pictures more than enough time in advance of the movie's July 20 release to ""do whatever they need to do"" to make sure Ledger is in it. ""In the last one, they flipped over a semi and blew up an entire hospital, so don't tell me they can't use a little movie magic to bring back Heath Ledger,"" said Hagerstown, MD resident Erin Matthews, adding that she doesn't care if Ledger's scene makes sense within the narrative framework of the film, just so long as he makes a cameo. ""Don't ask me how'I'm not the moviemaker here, okay? If Warner Bros. does its job and makes me happy, I'll do my job and pay to watch the movie. It's as simple as that."" The moviegoers said any of the following scenarios would be acceptable in the film: Batman visits Joker'played by Ledger'in Arkham Asylum, there is a kind of mutual respect between the two, and they have a conversation about the film's main antagonist, Bane; an epilogue featuring Ledger that subtly suggests the Joker will be the main villain in a future Batman movie; a completely unrelated scene in the middle of the movie where Bruce Wayne talks to a makeup-less Joker, but it's clear that neither is aware of the other's secret identity; a brief vignette in which Jack Nicholson's Joker from the 1989 film Batman talks to Heath Ledger about how the two Jokers should team up and run Gotham City together. When asked how they would respond if the movie studio is unable to add any of the requested scenes, moviegoers said they ""literally don't want to hear it."" ""First off, this isn't open for discussion; it's not about able or unable,"" Kyle Reardon, 26, said. ""Secondly, I'm not the head of Warner Bros., but if I were, and I were spending $250 million on a film, damn straight I'd spend an extra 5 or 10 million or whatever it costs to put a living, breathing Heath Ledger up on that movie screen. Thirdly, everyone likes it when the bad guy from an older movie shows up in the sequel and talks about stuff that happened in the last one, so this seems like a no-brainer to me."" ""Clearly the movie will be better with Heath Ledger in it, so get it done for Christ's sake,"" Reardon added. ""And throw Adam West and Burgess Meredith in there, too. And also a quick scene where Michael Keaton talks to Bob Kane about Batman."" Though the movie studio has yet to comment on the demands, sources confirmed Ledger's former agents are working on a deal similar to one reached with Warner Bros. to allow a basically dead Robert De Niro to appear in 2011's New Year's Eve.","entertainment, news, vol 48 issue 07, entertainment"

""It's a period piece with British accents and drama that hinges on each character's place within an aristocratic peerage system, so needless to say, viewing one show from beginning to end is basically the same as reading a book,"" Education Secretary Arne Duncan said. ""Also you really have to pay attention to the storylines, so it's also like reading in that respect. And it's not as if you can stop watching Downton Abbey for a while, come back to it, and remember exactly what's going on. You'd probably have to start over from the very beginning, just like you do with a book."" Duncan then excused himself from the press conference so he could go home and watch a couple books before he went to bed.","entertainment, news in brief, vol 48 issue 06, entertainment"

1688,Miranda July Called Before Congress To Explain Exactly What Her Whole Thing Is,"WASHINGTON'Congress convened a special investigative committee this week in an attempt to put to rest questions that have puzzled the nation for much of the past decade, namely what public figure Miranda July's whole thing is, exactly. July'of whom many Americans are somewhat aware without being able to articulate what, precisely, she's driving at'was subpoenaed by the Senate following the release last month of her high-concept independent film The Future, just her second feature in the past seven years. July's latest cinematic offering, in addition to her myriad other confusing, seemingly unconnected multimedia projects, has reportedly left the nation more perplexed than ever about what it is she's going for with all this. ""Now, Ms. July, we want to stress that you are in no way on trial here,"" committee chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) said at the outset of the proceedings. ""On behalf of the American people, we simply want to know what it is you'd say you're about, in a nutshell. We know that you're an actress, in a manner of speaking, and that you're also some kind of performance artist or something, but to be quite honest, no one can quite put a finger on what your whole deal is, so to speak."" ""On a personal note, we'd like you to know that we find you to be a perfectly pleasant young woman,"" Grassley added. ""But seri­ously, what are you trying to accomplish? What's the whole endgame here, Ms. July?"" Though finding her polite, many lawmakers later described July as largely uncooperative, especially in regard to her responses to the committee's queries, which often took the form of enigmatic aphorisms or the suggestion that members of Congress try looking at a candle for a few seconds to find the answers to their questions. The committee pushed forward, however, saying that while they were aware July had re­cently published a book and has contributed short stories to The Paris Review and McSweeney's, among other publications, they remained concerned as to whether July's disparate, largely ephemeral activities could be said to amount to a cohesive body of work or a sustainable career. ""We see you have a website here in which you give people what could best be described as arts and crafts 'homework assignments' of various sorts, but to be quite honest, we can't make head or tail of it,""  Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY) said while consulting a laptop in order to view one of July's perplexing Internet outlets, learningtoloveyoumore.com. ""By all outward appearances, you seem to be doing just fine, financially speaking, but if money somehow directly or indirectly changes hands due to your online activities, it's really completely beyond us how, or to what end."" ""If, for example, I wanted to buy something from you, how would I do it?"" a visibly frustrated Schumer continued. ""And what would it be? Would it be something I could hold in my hands?"" Others on the committee noted that July had released a smattering of music through Portland, OR's influential Kill Rock Stars record label, and suggested that maybe she just stick with her recording career exclusively so everyone could just say she was a musician and leave it at that. Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) at one point attempted a drastically different style of questioning in which he clearly explained to July what his own whole thing is in hopes that she would reciprocate in a way that everyone could understand. ""Perhaps we're approaching this in the wrong way; Ms. July, when I wake up in the morning, I say to myself, 'I'm going to go to work and help make the laws that keep our country running,'"" McConnell said. ""Now, when you wake up in the morning, what do you say to yourself? What is it that compels you to do all these things that you do?"" July, however, mostly ignored the probings and proceeded to cut up pieces of construction paper to make a large banner reading ""You Will Find It!"" which she then hung from the front of the table at which she was sitting. ""Please, Ms. July, we're just trying to understand!"" an exasperated Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) said at one point during the hearing when July dumped out a large shoe box full of buttons of various sizes and colors onto the Senate floor and began sorting them. After nearly nine hours of questioning, the committee adjourned without having made any significant headway in determining what July's whole thing is. ""What an unbelievable slog,"" a congressional aide who wished to remain anonymous said following the proceedings. ""That was even more unproductive than the hearings held to find out who the fuck James Franco thinks he is.""","entertainment, news, vol 48 issue 03, entertainment"

'For starters, there'll be no mention of the dragons at all, because I'm pretty much sick of writing about dragons at this point,' said Martin, who added he would also be introducing an entirely new storyline set on a completely different continent and featuring a cast of at least 50 new characters all vying for the same throne. 'And I'm going to take even longer to write these last two, at least a decade each. Who knows if I'll even be alive to finish them? Who cares? My son knows how to spell most of the characters' names, so maybe I'll let him wrap the whole thing up.' Martin said that while he didn't want to give too much away, he was certainly going to kill off Tyrion and never resurrect him, because 'that fucking dwarf' was annoying the shit out of him.","entertainment, books, news in brief, game of thrones, george rr martin, vol 48 issue 01, entertainment"

1769,Former 'Munsters' Star Butch Patrick To Write Autobiography On Word Processor Bought At Yard Sale,"PHILADELPHIA'Butch Patrick, 58, a former child actor who appeared on television's The Munsters, has announced plans to write an autobiography on the word processor he just purchased for $11, yard sale sources confirmed Saturday. Patrick, who from 1964 to 1966 played the role of Eddie Munster on the CBS sitcom about a family of monsters, discovered the Smith Corona personal word-processing typewriter at a rummage sale, where it was sitting on a blanket in the grass. He immediately picked up the device and reportedly carried it around while browsing to prevent another savvy customer from swooping in and buying the piece of used electronic equipment. ""I'm really lucky I didn't get here five minutes later, because I'm certain it would have been long gone,"" said Patrick, adding that he got a great deal on the word processor and that it would be ""perfect"" for finally getting his memoirs down on paper. ""This thing probably costs a bunch of money at RadioShack now, but I got it for a steal. And the best part is, I even got a discount."" ""There are perks to being famous,"" Patrick continued. According to yard sale organizers, Patrick was very excited about the electronic typewriter, approaching several strangers perusing items on a folding table to explain the machine had a couple of small scratches but was otherwise in ""pretty great"" condition. Patrick also pointed out on numerous occasions that the word processor had a screen that displays several lines of text at once. ""This thing is cool, because if you mess up, it's not a problem, you just use the backspace button to erase the mistake,"" said Patrick, who reportedly told customers the technology would cut down on his autobiography's production costs, because he would not have to buy correction tape. ""It's loaded with features that are going to make my book look tremendous. You can change the margins, center words on the title page."" ""When you're in show business, you need everything to look very professional,"" added the man whose last major role was in 1971 on the Sid and Marty Krofft show Lidsville, in which he played a teenage boy who magically enters a world of living hats. Patrick also informed customers his new purchase would significantly expedite efforts to complete the first draft of his autobiography. ""I've already got about 30 pages down on hotel notepads'a lot of the first season Munsters stuff,"" Patrick said. ""So I just need to transfer it to this. It also has a floppy disc drive so you can save the work and don't have to retype everything if you lose a chapter."" While Patrick assured everyone at the rummage sale his autobiography would compile numerous anecdotes from his early years working on a hit TV show, the 58-year-old said the book would primarily focus on his life after television and contain stories about struggling with drug and alcohol abuse, finding work in Hollywood, and appearing at promotional events and meet-and-greets nationwide. Saying it was highly unlikely publishers would pass on a chance to buy his life story, Patrick explained that even if his manuscript was rejected, he would still be able to use the word processor to print out copies he could sell at comic book conventions and memorabilia shows. Linda Brunner, who hosted the yard sale on her front lawn, said Patrick repeatedly mentioned that he starred in The Munsters before inquiring about the price of the typewriter. ""He kept saying how people were always asking him his favorite thing about being on The Munsters or if things changed on the set after his sister was replaced by a different actress or something,"" Brunner said. ""I told him the word processor was 14 bucks, but then he just got this crestfallen look on his face, so I gave it to him for $11. He got really excited when I threw in about 40 sheets of typing paper."" ""He seemed interested in a sandwich maker I was selling, but just sorta shook his head and mumbled something like, 'You can't pull it off, Butch,'"" Brunner added. Sources estimated Patrick ""hung around"" the yard sale for approximately an hour after purchasing the word processor, eventually buying two button-up shirts and encouraging shoppers to attend this year's GhoulCon.","entertainment, news, vol 47 issue 42, entertainment"

1777,Actor Sometimes Feels Silly Pretending To Be Someone Else,"MALIBU, CA'Calling the process of acting as though you are someone you are not a ""pretty ridiculous thing to do,"" actor Ed Harris, 60, admitted to reporters Tuesday that he frequently feels silly pretending to be another person. ""I don't know, I guess there's just something really goofy about being, like, 'Hello, my name is Frank, and I'm a cop,' or whatever, when that's not who I am at all,"" said Harris, adding that it is especially weird doing this on the set of a movie because ""the whole thing is make-believe but everyone has to act like it's real."" ""Sometimes they give me a hat or something to wear, or I'm supposed to speak with an accent, and then I feel especially silly because it's like, 'Why am I wearing this hat and talking in this funny voice? This is so weird and dumb, you know?'"" Despite his numerous acting credits over a long career, Harris said having to move around and do things for long stretches of time while confidently saying he is someone who he actually isn't has ""never stopped seeming ludicrous, really, and in fact becomes more preposterous the older I get because now I'm like a 60-year-old guy playing pretend."" While Harris said he is sometimes able to distract himself from the ""unbelievable silliness of it all"" by simply acting like himself, he told reporters that doing so is often very difficult because he is made to say and do things that he himself would never say or do, typically in places he's never been to and while wearing clothes that do not actually belong to him. ""Sometimes I have to pretend to get mad and yell at someone who I'm not even angry with'and that person is pretending to be someone else, too, so I have to call them by the name of the person they are pretending to be while I'm yelling at them,"" said Harris, adding that he occasionally catches his own reflection in a mirror or pane of glass while he's pretending to be someone else and it ""cracks [him] up every time."" ""Most of the time when they're filming me acting like a guy who's not me, I'm just hoping to get through it without smiling or laughing when I look at the person I'm talking to."" ""It's really hard,"" Harris added. The prolific actor went on to explain that the process is made doubly ridiculous by the fact that he is regularly instructed to go back and say the same thing he has just said again, and that the person he is saying it to is then instructed to act as though they are hearing what he's saying for the first time, even if it's actually the 10th or 11th time they've heard him say it. Harris also said none of this is talked about by anyone else on set, which he described as a weird thing. ""Look, I'm not complaining, because it's sort of neat and it actually pays a lot of money; it's just pretty silly, that's all,"" Harris said. ""Anyway, that's about all I have to say about acting.""","entertainment, news, vol 47 issue 41, entertainment"

1806,Bruce Springsteen Releases New Sci-Fi Concept Album About Struggles Of Poor Miners Working On Mars,"RUMSON, NJ'After more than a year of writing and recording, Bruce Springsteen released his 18th studio album Tuesday, a concept record titled Red Dust that explores the everyday lives and struggles of immigrant workers scraping by in the 23rd-century carbonate mines on Mars. According to the 61-year-old songwriter, the new tracks depict rugged Martian colonists as they come to question what's happened to their lives, finding themselves saddled with unpayable debts and hard-pressed to put food on the table for their embryonically harvested juvenile-clones. ""These are songs about growing up on a tough planet,"" said Springsteen, telling reporters that when the idea of humans and aliens working side by side in an extraterrestrial labor colony first occurred to him, he immediately knew he ""had to tell their story."" ""The Martians aren't trying to run away from their lives or make excuses. They're proud of what they do and where they're from, even if the high-impact ion-compression carbonate mining industry isn't what it used to be."" ""I try to write about universal feelings and desires,"" Springsteen continued. ""There's tragedy, grief, redemption. But there's also nostalgia for one's carefree younger days of racing souped-up hyper-thrust cruisers through the Valles Marineris canyon, and for nights spent chasing Martian girls along the rusting boardwalks of a crater-side spaceport."" Springsteen explained that in addition to its stark, poignant portrait of a decaying futuristic mining colony, the album serves as a cautionary tale about the extinction of the galactic middle-class and functions, in itself, as a protest against the policies of a corrupt Planetary Federation that willfully neglects its poorest and neediest organisms. The album's first single, a swaggering radio-ready stadium anthem called ""Dead Man's Home,"" tells the tale of a construction worker drafted to fight in an unjust interstellar war, only to return disillusioned to his Martian hometown, where the ground is too frozen to bury the remains of friends killed by a burst of plasma shrapnel. Guitarist Steven Van Zandt said that while E Street Band members had reservations about the album's concept, they were impressed with Springsteen's earnestness when he explained how the miners had moved to the colony seeking a good, honest living and then had nowhere to turn once the Martian economy failed. ""Frankly, we weren't really sure what he was talking about,"" said Van Zandt, noting he still has no clue what the song ""Icecap Cadillac"" is trying to say. ""But he seemed really passionate about it, and we'd already been through 16 straight hours of rehearsal, so eventually we just went along with it."" Thus far, the album has earned mixed reviews. While many critics have expressed deep bemusement at Springsteen's sharp departure from realism, others, such as Rolling Stone editor David Fricke, have hailed the effort as ""another well-executed and stirring tribute to working-class heroes by the Boss."" ""It's a triumphant return to Springsteen's populist roots'when you hear these tales of yearning space loners on the economically ravaged olivine plains, there's an instant emotional connection,"" said Fricke, adding that Red Dust was arguably Springsteen's finest work since 1987's Tunnel Of Love. ""You can't help but feel the desperation of hard-drinking Crazy Davey sitting at the space-dock bar in 'Solid Ground,' or the communal sense of resolve to rise up after a terrorist asteroid attack in 'Martian Shoulders.'"" ""It's vintage Bruce, really,"" Fricke continued. ""He hits you with a driving heartland rocker about getting your first ion-boring union card, and then turns around and delivers a stirring elegy to a Venusian migrant who was photon-blasted 41 times by merciless police droids. These are really powerful images that stick with you."" Praising the album's sparse, harmonica- laden title track, Fricke cited the acoustic number's bleak chorus as the record's finest expression of the battered miners' resilience: We drill our way through thick basalt Beneath a distant sun. The two moons rise and nothing's left But red dust in our lungs. The album is currently available for purchase in stores and online, with 10 percent of all proceeds going to the Red Dust Fund to help poor Martian miners should they ever come into existence.","entertainment, music, our annual year 2011, news, vol 47 issue 37, entertainment"

1822,Area Man Obsessed With Knowing If Kevin Spacey Asshole In Real Life,"VANCOUVER, WA'Local resident Pat Brouger spent more than an hour Saturday speculating about whether or not actor Kevin Spacey is an asshole in everyday life. Brouger, 29, told reporters that while it would be ""cool"" to find out Spacey was a really nice guy away from the camera, he also wouldn't be surprised if he eventually learned the actor was ""a total dick."" Sources confirmed Brouger has been wanting to know this information on and off since 1997, when he watched the film L.A. Confidential. ""I think he's a good actor'I just kind of want to know if he's a jerk or not,"" said Brouger, who on several occasions has asked his friends if they think Spacey would be an asshole to hang out with. ""He just seems like he might be the smug 'holier than thou' type, but I could be wrong."" ""Philip Seymour Hoffman seems like that, too, but I've actually heard he's pretty nice,"" added Brouger, who has typed the words ""Kevin Spacey Jerk?"" into his search engine more than once. ""I bet [Spacey] is really sarcastic, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's a bad guy. Then again, if he overdoes it, I can see how that could become really annoying. It's tough to tell if you don't actually know him, though."" Brouger explained that while he tries not to jump to conclusions based purely on Spacey's movie roles, it's hard for him to watch Glengarry Glen Ross and not think that's how Spacey actually is. ""There's this one part where he's a real smart ass, and I feel like that's pretty hard to fake,"" said Brouger, who went on to list all the films he could remember in which Spacey acts like an prick, and then later said that he wouldn't be surprised if Spacey's offscreen persona fell somewhere between his characters in Swimming With Sharks and American Beauty. ""And take The Negotiator, for example. Even though he's a good guy in that, he's certainly not likable. Well, he's likable because he's kind of a prick, but I don't think that works as well in real life as it does in the movies. ""Yes, [Spacey's character] helps out Samuel L. Jackson in the end,"" Brouger continued, ""but Samuel L. Jackson is clearly desperate. Anyone else would have been like, 'Okay, buddy, shut your mouth.' Tommy Lee Jones is like that in The Fugitive, but I bet he's an awesome guy in real life."" Though Brouger listed several reasons why Spacey might not be an asshole, including his willingness to do a cameo in an Austin Powers movie and his Christopher Walken impression, the 29-year-old said he still thinks Spacey is most likely a dick, evidenced by an anecdote relayed to him by his friend Carey, who said her roommate April waited on Spacey in a Los Angeles restaurant once and Spacey didn't give a very big tip. In addition, Brouger said he once saw a picture of Spacey in a magazine wearing these sunglasses that made him look really cocky. Brouger also told reporters that he has watched, read, and listened to various interviews with the actor, and that even though Spacey comes off as ""personable and down to earth,"" there is ultimately no way to tell if Spacey is really that charming or if he is just acting. ""It's not like he's going to be a jerk in interviews, because then everyone would see that he's a jerk, and I'm sure he doesn't want that,"" Brouger explained. ""I'm just saying, he might be a saint in front of the camera and an asshole behind the scenes."" Continued Brouger, ""I bet a lot of them are like that."" At press time, Brouger said he was still leaning toward Spacey being an asshole, but added that his friend Mitch had a point about The Usual Suspects being a pretty cool movie.","entertainment, news, vol 47 issue 35, entertainment"

1830,Novelist Has Whole Shitty World Plotted Out,"GLOUCESTER, MA'As he neared completion this week on his latest novel, By The Water's Edge, author Edward Milligan marveled aloud to reporters how he was able to flesh out, in meticulous detail, every single corner of his book's vast and stunningly shitty world. According to Milligan, he spent seven months conducting in-depth historical research in order to conjure, as if out of thin air, the fictional and entirely bullshit universe of Connor's Cove, Massachusetts, including its utterly uninspired lighthouse, the predictably dark underbelly lurking beneath its quaint exterior, and its painfully trite main thoroughfare known as Chance Street. ""As an author, my job is to use my gift for detail to construct a sense of place so real that readers will almost feel as though they can step inside of it and walk around,"" said Milligan, who spent weeks mapping out the entire genealogy of the fictional founders of Connor's Cove, from their completely uninteresting origins all the way to their somehow even more mind-numbingly dull present-day progeny. ""Every shop, every house, every inhabitant has a function within this little microcosm I've dreamed up."" ""I believe that, by immersing themselves fully in the story, readers will actually become a part of Connor's Cove, in a sense,"" the author added incorrectly. Having reportedly lived along the Massachusetts coast for more than two decades, Milligan drew heavily from only the most hackneyed and obvious aspects of maritime culture to depict life on the harbor, even going so far as to thoroughly research New England dialects in order to authentically craft the grating and unbearable phonetic renderings of speech he uses for all the book's terrible dialogue. Milligan also said his novel's tedious descriptions of local flora and fauna, needlessly complex and yet childishly rendered sociopolitical context, and embarrassingly obvious parallels to major events in American history were all necessary to help lend his utterly garbage story a real and lived-in sense of verisimilitude. ""By carefully thinking through every detail, I made Connor's Cove feel like an organic extension of reality,"" said Milligan, unaware that his overwrought, tiresome backstories on each and every dilapidated lobster boat in the harbor and countless other minutiae added nothing to his flimsy, hard-to-follow story arc. ""In such a vital world, you don't simply read about a village, you smell its salt air and feel all of its joys and all of its struggles."" When he wasn't blatantly wasting his time detailing the architecture of the Town Hall building or supplying dozens of fictional bridges and creeks with names that sound as if they were invented by a high school English student, Milligan was focusing his energies on crafting a diverse social stratum of characters so nondescript and stripped of anything resembling actual humanity that they might as well be lampposts. ""Each resident of Connor's Cove is such a unique and complex individual, with his or her own rich family ancestry going back centuries,"" said Milligan, who relied on a host of sad literary crutches to differentiate his bland characters from one another, including limps, horrendous signature phrases, and in one agonizing instance, an eye patch. ""In fact, they surprise even me. I never know what they're going to do next."" ""Lionel [King] would have to be my favorite [character],"" he added, describing the two- dimensional protagonist who is clearly based on Milligan himself and whose insipid ruminations provide a dull glimpse into the author's own banal, self-important existence. ""He's so multifaceted. But then again, all my characters are like little worlds unto themselves."" Claiming he was genuinely proud of his ham-handed effort, the apparently shameless Milligan then expounded on the fact that he was ""really going to miss"" Connor's Cove once the book was completed, and even somehow had the fucking balls to say that it had been a ""pretty magical place to spend the last few years."" ""Connor's Cove is such a fascinating world, and there's still so much left to reveal,"" said the author, who, at press time, had not yet been punched in the face. ""Thankfully, I'll be going back there soon, and readers can look forward to four more riveting tales in the Connor's Cove series.""","entertainment, unsponsored, news, vol 47 issue 34, entertainment"

1840,"Nation's Celebrities Not Famous Enough, Publicists Agree","LOS ANGELES'In a group statement released Monday to all known broadcast, cable, online, and print news outlets, publicists from throughout the entertainment industry urgently warned that the nation's celebrities remain ""dangerously under-famous"" and need to become ""much, much more"" famous than they currently are. Citing what they referred to as ""an alarming lack"" of buzz, heat, press, and word-of-mouth surrounding the country's celebrities, the consortium of publicists called for immediate action to help remedy deficiencies in celebrity name-recognition and career-awareness nationwide. ""The current level of celebrity fame is, quite simply, unacceptable,"" the strongly worded statement read in part. ""We, as a society, must rectify this problem by paying more attention to the celebrities who occupy the public sphere, right away and without delay. Their faces need to be on more magazines covers, their names need to be spoken aloud more often, and their careers need to be more unmistakably on the rise."" ""The time for standing idly by while fame levels stagnate or drop is over"" the statement concluded. ""The nation's celebrities desperately need real, quality face-time with the American public, and they need it now."" Publicists everywhere, all of whom are in total agreement about the grave conclusions reached in the collective report, stressed that the nation's actors, musicians, competitive dance show contestants, satellite-radio personalities, game show hosts, politicians, media pundits, club-scene staples, talk-show circuit regulars, authors of bestselling legal thrillers, models, infotainment providers, fashion designers, charity spokespersons, comedians, athletes, pop singers, television evangelists, porn stars with tell-all autobiographies being published soon, professional poker players, independent filmmaking auteurs, high-profile magazine editors, and magicians are all on the cusp of greater stardom and require the immediate fascination of mainstream America. According to the consortium of publicists, it is also absolutely crucial that the nations' celebrities achieve crossover fame in multiple markets. ""Our mission is to ensure celebrities get their names out there and keep them out there,"" said publicist Luke Stone, explaining that these people'and notably his clients'are all the very highest talents in their respective fields. ""They are simply too good and too gifted not to be seen and heard. Everyone in the country should be talking about these people."" While noting that the reasons the nation's celebrities deserve more attention are ""innumerable,"" the publicists listed a number of specific factors such as likability, overall sexiness, personality, charm, and the fact that they have a big new project coming out right now that represents the best work'by far'of their entire careers. The publicists also stressed that, although a nice low-profile indie project would go a long way toward solidifying the artistic credibility of the nation's celebrities, what they urgently require right now is a hit. ""There are approximately 6 billion human beings living on this planet, and we believe each and every one of them should know not only who the nation's celebrities are, but what they are working on, what they have just finished, and what their plans after this may or may not turn out to be,"" publicist Janet Thompson said. ""Additionally, the topics of what they are wearing, who they are dating, and where they are going on vacation are urgent matters about which awareness must be increased as soon as possible."" Reiterating that the nation's celebrities are currently at the peak of their powers and primed for either a breakout hit, a successful follow-up, or the comeback of a lifetime, publicists across the country lamented the fact that so many famous individuals are not being provided with the support they so urgently need. ""The sad fact we are facing is that many famous people today exist below the level of household name,"" publicist James Friar, also a signatory of the statement, told reporters. ""For example, there are literally billions of people out there who do not even know who Graham Bunn is. I'm sorry to say it, but it's true. And that is something we should all be ashamed of."" ""Even a cursory glance at Graham Bunn's body of work reveals him to be an extraordinary individual,"" he added. As of press time, each and every one of the celebrities asked to comment on the ongoing fame-inadequacy emergency were available, in the form of exclusive interviews, magazine cover stories, and high-profile television appearances, and could be reached via their respective publicists.","entertainment, news, vol 47 issue 34, entertainment"

""I've always been interested in blues music, and this album will really explore that interest,"" Clapton told reporters, explaining that many of the new songs would feature long blues guitar solos, repeating 12-bar-blues chord structures, and lyrical themes centered around both getting and continuing to have the blues. ""I'm fairly confident about the project, as I plan to sing with a sort of forlorn, bluesy quality in my voice, and I'll be playing a lot of E, A, and B chords, along with all the blue notes of the scale. Just pure and simple blues, really."" Clapton later admitted that while each track would definitely be inspired by blues music, the final product might actually be more of a blues-rock album.","entertainment, music, our annual year 2011, news, vol 47 issue 33, entertainment"

""Wow. Between its cloying indie soundtrack, quirky animated title sequence, and tangential subplot ending in a failed suicide attempt, I felt every bit as patronized as I did watching Transformers 3,"" viewer Samantha Holmes, 26, said of the latest release from IFC Films, which stars Kat Dennings and, in a few key scenes in which emotional truths are revealed, Paul Dano. ""Maybe even more so, since at least Transformers 3 wasn't pretending to be something it's not.""

1929,I Just Want To Say That I Hated Every Moment Of That Piece-Of-Shit Show,"Wow, I guess that's it. It's hard to believe that after pouring my heart and soul into that show for 25 years, I'll never tape another episode, sit down with another guest, or connect with another fan again. And thank fucking God for that, because I hated every moment of that piece-of-shit show. Literally every single moment just made me want to die. Look, I'll be the first to tell you that my program was absolute garbage. It was 25 years of trite, predictable, emotionally manipulative drivel. I brought people on the show, I talked to them, I wanted to puke the entire time because of how stupid the whole thing was, and then, at the end of the day, it took everything in my power not to blow my own brains out. To the people who found my personality relatable, I say this: I'm a fucking billionaire, I don't relate to you at all, and I can now say with complete impunity that I want all you pathetic losers to go fuck yourselves. Every single show was a struggle. I was utterly disgusted by every person I sat next to on that oversized couch, and it took all I had to pretend I gave a shit about whatever Wynonna Judd had rattling around in her skull, or to act all spellbound when some frump looked marginally more presentable following a haircut from stylist-to-the-stars Ken Paves. I don't know what people at home thought they were watching, but what they were actually looking at was a self-loathing woman trying her best not to have a total nervous breakdown before the next commercial break. I did 4,561 episodes of The Oprah Winfrey Show. Now, imagine taking a pair of hedge clippers and cutting off your big toe 4,561 times, and that's a fraction of the physical and mental anguish I was going though. That my name was associated with the whole thing made it that much more excruciating. I hated them all: I hated Hugh Jackman. I hated Jim Carrey. I hated Dakota Fanning. I honestly couldn't care less about injured war veterans, or about that one girl who survived genocide to attend Yale. The daughter whose dying mother made her taped messages before she died? I actually had to stop myself from rolling my eyes while the girl told me that story because of how stupid I thought the whole idea was. Lisa Marie Presley was absolutely disgusting, Miley Cyrus was a waste, Stevie Wonder bored me to death, and Brooke Shields annoyed the ever-living fuck out of me. And you know what? I hated Sidney Poitier most of all. Yeah, I get it. He's black, I'm black. Big fucking deal. Did you know Celine Dion was on my show 27 times? You want to try having the same conversation with Celine Dion 27 goddamn times? The money was, well, unbelievable. Sure, I had to sit there and make believe that helping a bunch of housewives locate their G-spot was a thing that mattered to me, or go a full hour without roundhousing Suze Orman, but it was worth it. Do you know how poor I was growing up? Really, really poor. So, when things got tough on set, I could always sneak off and call my accountant, whom I would force to tell me how much money was in my bank account over and over and over again till I had the strength to make it through another heart-to-heart with a 13-year-old who was too young to be having sex. You want the truth? I was glad the 13-year-old was having sex. Good for her. At least somebody on the set was having a little fun. The truth is, it wasn't in my nature to quit, but I wouldn't have minded if I'd gotten fired. I actually thought that by giving away things like diamond watches and trips to Australia and cars'hundreds of cars'to my audience, I'd somehow bankrupt the show. Nope. Those turned out to be some of the most popular segments in television history. I couldn't sabotage myself when I tried. Just real fast before I forget: Rachael Ray is atrocious. Dr. Oz is the fucking worst. And the book club is stupid. I could literally give a flying fuck if more Americans read. In any case, I'm finally out now, officially. When the director said 'That's a wrap' for the very last time, I took off my lavalier microphone, walked directly to my dressing room, didn't talk to a single fucking person on my sycophantic staff, grabbed my coat, got into my limousine, and told my driver to get me the hell away from what has been the most humiliating time of my life. You know what? I take back what I said earlier. This wasn't worth the money. Nothing this demeaning is. If I could do it all over again, I would stay anonymous and dirt poor.","entertainment, unsponsored, our annual year 2011, commentary, vol 47 issue 50, oprah winfrey, entertainment"

'I spoke to a production assistant whose job was to buy the pine martens and sneak them into Gentle's trailer,' said Gary Collins, whose book Go, Gentle, Into That Good Night contends the bear 'was not always as gentle as his public image would suggest.' 'He refused to work until he'd had at least five pine martens, and by the time he stumbled onto the set, he could barely make it through his scenes. When he finally crashed, he sometimes hibernated for a year or more. That cost him a role on Grizzly Adams.' According to the book, it was only with the help of Bear Jesus that Gentle Ben was able to break the chains of his crippling Mustelidae addiction.","entertainment, news in brief, vol 47 issue 19, animals, nature, dispatch, entertainment"

1978,Silicon Valley Town Pinning Tourism Hopes On World's Largest Website,"SUNNYVALE, CA'The wonder in 8-year-old Hayley Dunbar's face as she stares out over what locals claim is the world's largest website makes it easy to understand why she and her father, Tom, drove all the way from Eugene, OR to see it. ""Wow, look at all of the links'I can't believe how huge it is!"" squeals Hayley, whose family is among the 200,000 people ex-pected to make the trip out to California's Santa Clara Valley this year to catch a glimpse of the marvel. ""How did they make a website so big, Daddy?"" To curious travelersEE like Hayley, TheWorlds LargestWebsite.com, located in the center of town and featuring thousands upon thousands of long, scrolling pages of text and images, is an impressive computer-age curio. But to the people of Sunnyvale it's much more than just a roadside attraction: It's a point of pride'and an economic boon'in a corner of Silicon Valley that has been all but forgotten since the late '90s. ""ter the bubble burst, we didn't have too many visitors coming through these parts,"" said Melinda Hamilton, mayor of the community that is now unmissable thanks to the billboards counting down the exits for 200 miles in all directions. ""But once word got out that we had the biggest website among all seven continents, that changed in a hurry. People from every walk of life suddenly wanted to make the trip to see the trillions of digits of HTML code and countless Java applets in person."" The world-record holding website, as well as the dozens of restaurants, hotels, and souvenir shops that have sprung up nearby, has, by some accounts, saved the local economy, and word of mouth continues to send more and more tourists to catch a glimpse of the famously vast scroll bar with their own eyes. According to its creator, Edward Capron, the site originally started in 2003 as a personal home page in his garage, but soon grew so large that he had to move it into his backyard, and finally to its current location in the center of town, where awed onlookers can admire its gigantic URL, as well as its seemingly endless site map. ""I wasn't trying to set a record for the world's largest website or anything, I just kept building on to it, and before I knew it I had a real whopper on my hands,"" said Capron, who claimed he knew he had created something special when friends and neighbors started lining up around the corner to sign the massive guestbook. ""Most people assume it's some sort of hoax at first, but once they come out here and see all the message board and search result pages for themselves, they're pretty wowed. Definitely something worth telling the friends back home about."" ""I know the folks out in Fremont say they've got the largest website, but I saw it and it's not even half as big as the one here,"" Capron added. ""And ours doesn't use any tricks or mirrors to make it appear extra-large or anything like that. It's the real deal."" According to locals, the town is constantly beset by website enthusiasts from around the globe who arrive with precision instruments, hoping to measure TheWorldsLargestWebsite .com themselves and discern its true dimensions. Each walks away as stunned and dumbfounded as the last. Meanwhile, as revenue from TheWorlds LargestWebsite.com T-shirts, mouse pads, and postcards continue to augur a brighter economic future for Sunnyvale, the reactions from visitors so far have been, to say the least, very encouraging. ""Usually these kinds of things end up being real tourist traps, but this was worth the detour,"" said Kevin McQuillan, 51, after posing for a picture with the site's FAQs. ""We're definitely going to come back again when the Frequently Asked Questions page isn't under construction."" Still, not all have been impressed by TheWorldsLargestWebsite.com's magnitude. Bill Jaffe, 45, who saw a road sign and decided to stop by the site during a cross-country trip last year, left disappointed. ""Maybe I came at a bad time, but all I got was a frozen hourglass and this huge error 404 message,"" Jaffe said. ""Frankly, the whole thing just looked kind of fake.""ll","entertainment, internet, optimism, news, vol 47 issue 17, entertainment"

1986,People Who Produce American Culture Warning Nation Ahead Of Time That Rest Of 2011 Going To Be Pretty Rough,"NEW YORK'A coalition of artists, filmmakers, novelists, musicians, fashion designers, and other producers of American culture issued a joint statement this week warning the nation's citizens that the remainder of 2011 was going to be ""pretty rough stuff."" The statement, which was signed and endorsed by every person working creatively nationwide, confirmed that the next eight months would be ""a train wreck"" and very likely the lousiest cultural period on record since 1999. ""We're urging everybody out there who is a consumer of American art and culture to prepare themselves, because they've got a real shit show headed their way,"" coalition member and movie producer Neal Moritz told reporters. ""Maybe you'd already guessed, considering how much crap has already been churned out this year, but let me tell you right now: It's about to get worse. A lot worse. Brace yourselves."" ""I'd like to say we tried our best, but we all know that's not true,"" Moritz added. Saying it was ""only fair"" to let the American people know what they were getting into, thousands of artists and mass-culture producers across the country confirmed that after the release of an Eddie Vedder solo album in May, followed by the Jim Carrey film Mr. Popper's Penguins in June, and then a new Tim Allen sitcom in the fall, citizens will soon start asking themselves why they even bother. Even distinguished artists, ranging from novelist Philip Roth to painter and photographer Chuck Close, verified in the statement that their upcoming 2011 works would be far from their best, and would only add to the feeling of cultural malaise expected to reach its low point sometime in late autumn. ""Oh man, you should see some of the American culture we've got lined up,"" said Atlantic Records A&R executive Tom Meyerson, holding a list of all forthcoming films, books, music, visual art, and poems slated for 2011. ""About 4,500 terrible novels, some movie called The Zookeeper with Kevin James, and a shitload of new sculptures that we got a sneak peak of and, trust me, these things are not looking too good at all."" ""Also, just to be clear, we're still going to inundate every square inch of the country with misleading advertisements about how great these projects are, which, of course, will just be part of the overall awfulness,"" Meyerson added. ""Hey, at least now you can't say you weren't warned."" The purveyors of American culture were quick to point out that, while they were strongly tempted to scrap everything for the rest of the year and just focus on 2012, commercial considerations had forced them to see their work through'especially considering that if they pulled every bad project from 2011 there would only end up being ""about five things left."" ""Even that's a pretty generous estimate,"" admitted coalition spokesman and Random House CEO Markus Dohle. ""I mean, there's new episodes of that show Men Of A Certain Age coming up, but does that really count as a highlight? That's pretty sad if it does, right?"" In response to the announcement, millions of Americans have already begun shifting their anticipation onto the tiny handfuls of culture they believe might stand a chance of being decent'such as Steven Spielberg's upcoming film War Horse'but people involved with these projects have attempted to deflect the public's attention. ""Let's not invest too much hope in my movie here, because it's really not that great,"" Spielberg said. ""It's fine, I suppose. Like, it won't be an embarrassment for me professionally or anything, but will it be some sort of 2011-salvaging masterpiece? Oh Lord, no. That would be impossible, believe me."" When asked what the American people could do to make it through the remainder of 2011, the nation's producers of culture suggested consumers avoid everything new for the next eight months and just stay inside rereading Cormac McCarthy novels and playing old Hüsker Dü records until Jan. 1.

""Ten solid days of hitting the links, catching up on some reading, and not making obscene or hurtful racial comments'can't wait,"" said Limbaugh, adding that once he touches down on the Hawaiian island he's going to play 36 holes at the Waialae Country Club and treat Hawaii's diverse population of indigenous islanders, Filipinos, Chinese, and Japanese with the same consideration he would give white people. ""Don't get me wrong'I love my job and I enjoy working my ill-informed fans into a frenzy by tapping into their deep-seeded, ignorant fears of people who are different from them. But when I'm on vacation, the phone is off, I'm not checking e-mail, and I don't even want to think about making iffy slurs or insensitive impersonations until I have to punch back in.""

1995,Author Promoting Book Gives It Her All Whether It's Just 3 People Or A Crowd Of 9 People,"CINCINNATI'Shortly before her reading Tuesday at local bookstore Word Mentality, author Francine Massey told reporters that she does her absolute best for everyone who comes out to see her, whether it's just three people or a much larger crowd of nine people. Massey, on hand to promote her novel A Lighthouse Keeper, said that with publishing houses slashing their marketing budgets, it often falls to writers themselves to make the most of every reading opportunity, from cozy gatherings of just a few fans at smaller booksellers to major events at chain stores that can draw upwards of 10 people. ""I have to remember that even if just one person shows up, he deserves the same passion and enthusiasm I would give to a big group of seven people or eight people,"" said Massey, watching as a bookstore employee began setting up rows of folding chairs. ""You just have to remind yourself that you're not going to be able to pack the room with half a dozen fans every time."" ""I've learned it's best to set your expectations lower and be pleasantly surprised when almost half a row is filled,"" Massey said. While she acknowledged it would be wonderful if seven people attended her upcoming reading, the author noted that it's important to be realistic, and to be able to adapt a reading to whatever circumstances present themselves. ""Sometimes 7:30 comes around and only three people are there, one of whom is my agent,"" Massey said. ""Well, rather than go through with the whole presentation I'd normally do for a group of six including my parents and a woman who appears to be mentally ill, I can make the reading into more of an intimate discussion where there's a lot more back-and-forth."" ""It's actually kind of nice to get up close with people and be able to look them in the eye,"" Massey added as her first audience member scanned the room and tentatively took a seat in the back row. ""Sometimes when it's this vast sea of eight faces, it doesn't feel like you're even talking to people at all."" Massey said other aspects of the event, such as the audience Q&A, can also be modified to accommodate the turnout. ""You might only get a single question, if any, with a really small audience,"" Massey said. ""But the good thing about that is you have time to offer a longer, more thoughtful response. At one of my bigger readings, I might get avalanched with two or even three questions and have to really keep it moving."" When asked if she could remember the largest audience she ever read in front of, Massey instantly recalled an event at a Minneapolis Borders at which 11 people, not even counting her old roommate from college or an elderly shopper who just wanted to sit for a moment, were in attendance'a reading she described as her ""ultimate rock-star ego boost."" As the bookstore employee stacked copies of Massey's novel on a table, the author told reporters that it didn't really matter to her if the line for the book-signing was just a couple of people long or ran all the way from one end of the table to the other. ""Honestly, meeting one devoted fan is enough to make my night,"" said Massey, nervously glancing at her watch. ""Even if I have to read for just that one person sitting all alone there in the back row, I'm going to give him the reading he deserves."" Checking her watch again, Massey sighed and added, ""Jesus Christ, one fucking person. All right, fine, whatever. Here we go.""","entertainment, news, vol 47 issue 15, entertainment"

""I figure it makes sense: Parties and bags of ice, those are two things that go together,"" said Haines, describing his inspiration for the hastily created, half-million-dollar soiree, which will feature five massive columns of ice bags stacked throughout the space, ice bags leading up the driveway, and possibly an ice-bag sculpture centerpiece, ""if there's time.""

""While the extended full-frontal shot of Howard's penis repeatedly entering Bernadette's exposed vagina is fairly explicit by most network TV standards, we made an exception, seeing as this was the season finale and the scene was sort of necessary to advance the story,"" said FCC chairman Julius Genachowski, who claimed the show's 8 p.m. airtime meant most kids were probably asleep anyway. ""Also, a lot of the funniest jokes wouldn't have made sense without actually showing the act of penetration all the way through to Howard ejaculating, so we figured we'd bend the rules just this once.""

""Between fighting to get William H. Macy on Kimmel, booking a CNN.com live chat with Marisa Tomei, and making sure every highway billboard, bus stop, and building has a poster of Mathew McConaughey sitting on the hood of that goddamn Lincoln, we've simply reached a point where people are either going to see The Lincoln Lawyer or they're not,"" said Lionsgate executive vice president David Spitz, who hasn't seen his wife in nearly three weeks and ""cannot spend one more minute"" trying to create buzz on Internet message boards. ""We even put the line 'Don't miss Matthew McConaughey's first trip back to the courtroom since A Time To Kill' in the trailer. Maybe that will fill a few seats. Who the hell knows?

2034,Keira Knightley Answers Fan Letter Way Too Quickly,"FORT WAYNE, IN'According to local computer programmer and Keira Knightley fan Tom Hayes, 38, the internationally known English film actress and model responded ""much too fast"" to the letter he sent just a few days ago. ""All I wrote was, 'I'm a big fan and I would love it if you would autograph this picture,'"" Hayes told reporters Thursday, holding Knightley's unusually prompt and thorough response to his original two- sentence-long letter. ""But then, just four days later'exactly four days'there's a FedEx guy at my door asking me to sign for an overnight delivery from Keira Knightley. I just figured it was some sort of mistake or joke, but it wasn't."" ""Now, think about that: I sent my letter by regular mail all the way to London, so in order for me to have received her reply so quickly, she literally must have read my letter the moment it got to her and then responded immediately,"" Hayes continued. ""That seems a little weird, right?"" Assuming that his original letter had simply been returned to sender, Hayes was surprised to find the package contained a 12-page handwritten document, a signed color photograph of Keira Knightley much larger than the black-and-white portrait of the actress he had sent, a variety of English candies, another photograph of a smiling Knightley holding Hayes' letter, and a few small handmade pencil drawings, presumably of the movie star's pets. Despite the fact that Hayes had actually mailed his letter to the 25-year-old performer's agent in London and not to Knightley herself, the Academy Award'nominated actress's response included her home address, her e-mail, private phone numbers for various residences in the U.K. and U.S., and 20 sheets of artisanal, pearl-foiled paper upon which Hayes was instructed to write his reply. Hayes also confirmed that a second copy of Knightley's letter arrived a few hours later with a note attached reading, ""In case the first one got lost in the mail! Yours, Keira."" ""And then the actual letter she wrote'man, you should see this thing,"" said Hayes, shaking his head as he scanned the lavender-scented document. ""She starts off talking about how my letter was a bright spot in her day and then goes on and on for pages about her childhood in Teddington, the trips she would take in the summer to visit her mother's family in Scotland, and her favorite movie memories. And at the end she goes on this long rant about how 'awesome' I am. I'm just reading this thing thinking, 'Why would she think I'm awesome? She doesn't even know me.'"" ""And why is there a collage in the margins that has baby pictures of her and drawings of flowers?"" Hayes added. ""Seriously, should I be worried about his?"" Although Hayes has not yet responded to Knightley, he confirmed that several additional replies have already arrived from the actress, each longer and more involved than the last. A letter from Knightley postmarked two days ago contained a variety of highlighted newspaper clippings related to recent happenings in the actress's life and career. Another postmarked the same day contained an 80-point questionnaire with such queries as ""What is your favorite cozy thing to do on a rainy afternoon?"" and ""Do you think I'm cool? Dont lie, lol."" In addition, Hayes told reporters that Knightley had sent him six separate film scripts with notes attached asking whether he thought the parts seemed right for her. ""Today she sent a message asking how I was holding up with all the construction they're doing on the house next door to me,"" said a wide-eyed Hayes. ""Okay, that started a day and a half ago. How did she know about that? And somehow she got my work address, because the other day all these stuffed animals appeared on my desk along with a cardboard cutout of her from Bend It Like Beckham. My boss was just like, 'What is all this crap?' It was really embarrassing."" ""She apologized later in one of her letters, but still,"" Hayes added. While Hayes claimed he remains an admirer of Knightley's work, he admitted to reporters that his adoration of the actress had diminished considerably, especially after his parents started getting bizarre postcards from the actress signed, ""Your son's biggest fan."" Hayes said he was considering sending a short, polite reply in a week or so thanking her for her letters and saying goodbye. ""Even though the whole thing has bordered on being sort of scary, I guess I ultimately do feel a little bad for her and think she really is a sweet girl,"" Hayes said. ""Still, I really wish she hadn't given my address to Daniel Craig. Jesus Christ, that guy just won't quit.""","entertainment, our annual year 2011, news, vol 47 issue 11, entertainment"

2062,Study: 87 Percent Of Movies Would Be Better With Michael Keaton In Them,"LOS ANGELES'According to a comprehensive study released this week by researchers at UCLA, 87 percent of feature-length motion pictures would be significantly improved by the addition of 59-year-old film and television actor Michael Keaton. The report, which gathered film data and survey results over a 12-year period, found that simply by adding Michael Keaton'either in a showy, leading-man part; a delicious, scene-stealing supporting role; or even an unexpected but heartily welcome cameo appearance'nearly 9 in 10 films would rate as at least ""better,"" and in many cases ""much better."" ""According to our results, the mere presence of Michael Keaton acts as a catalyst by which the quality of a film rises exponentially in relation to his screen time,"" said lead researcher Dr. Jonathan Scott, who has been studying Keaton intensively since the actor's appearance in the 1982 comedy Night Shift. ""Ninety-three percent of comedies would be improved by the addition of his manic, live-wire energy, while a full 72 percent of dramatic features would benefit from his surprisingly adept touch with tender characterizations."" ""Overall, we were impressed by these results, although one can hardly call them surprising,"" Scott continued. ""I mean, of course these films would be better. It's Michael Keaton."" After observing how Michael Keaton made the otherwise unwatchable films Jack Frost and My Life 58 percent more watchable, researchers said they determined that 100 percent of films of equal or lesser quality would have experienced similar results if Michael Keaton had been cast in them. In addition, a film's genre had no noticeable effect on the results, with the report concluding that Michael Keaton is equally at home in blockbuster action films like Batman, broad farces like Johnny Dangerously, and emotionally harrowing films like Clean And Sober. Further analysis found that the film The Hunt for Red October would have been 31 percent more solid with Michael Keaton in the Alec Baldwin role. ""The remarkable versatility of Michael Keaton was a key factor in the resulting data,"" said Scott, gesturing to a screen behind him playing Michael Keaton's famous ""wubby"" speech from the 1983 film Mr. Mom. ""In fact, his mastery of his craft posed a series of further questions to our team: questions such as, 'Is there any role that Michael Keaton can't play?' and 'Why is Michael Keaton not being utilized more in movies these days?'"" Another significant finding was that many classic films heretofore believed to be impossible to improve upon'including Citizen Kane, The Seven Samurai, The Battleship Potemkin, and Pinocchio'would actually be enhanced substantially by an on-screen appearance by Michael Keaton in some capacity, if only for a few precious moments. ""We determined that if Charlie Chaplin had simply turned the camera on Michael Keaton for five minutes in City Lights and just let him go wild like in Beetlejuice, then that film would be at least 12 percent stronger than it is now,"" said Scott, adding that Michael Keaton's work as a psychotic killer in Pacific Heights proves he also would have considerably aided Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. ""And a majority of movies double in quality if, while watching them, the viewer imagines the way Michael Keaton would deliver a given character's lines."" ""Conventional wisdom would tell us that these figures are impossible, as Michael Keaton is far from being some great Shakespearean actor,"" Scott continued. ""But that's where conventional wisdom is wrong: Michael Keaton is a great Shakespearean actor. He played Dogberry in Kenneth Branagh's adaptation of Much Ado About Nothing and he crushed it' just knocked it right out of the park. "" Researchers concluded their remarks by claiming that a number of films already featuring Michael Keaton, including Jackie Brown, The Dream Team, and The Other Guys, would have greatly benefited from the insertion of even more Michael Keaton into certain scenes, preferably every scene. In response to the UCLA team's announcement, actor Michael Keaton downplayed the findings. ""Okay, you guys,"" said Keaton, instantly making a newspaper article better simply by appearing briefly and uttering a few words. ""Settle down.""","entertainment, our annual year 2011, news, vol 47 issue 08, entertainment"

2070,The Daily Bump: The Buzz On Howie Mandel's Oscars,"So long, Anne and James! In a surprise move, funnyman Howie Mandel was tapped to be the new host the 83rd Academy Awards, according to sources inside Mandel's imagination. What can we expect from the telecast now that Howie is daydreaming he's at the helm? Our Star Fix mind-reporters give us a sneak peek of what we can expect Sunday night. The biggest musical number in Oscars history: The performance will feature 1,000 dancers wearing costumes made of colored feathers, dancing holographs of dozens of famous screen actors from history, and a pyrotechnics show just like the one Howie remembers seeing at a Van Halen concert in 1988. Mandel himself will amaze the crowd with the his incredible tap dancing as sings a rendition of the number-one hit song ""Howie Wowie."" Alyssa Milano: The actress Alyssa Milano will sit in the front row and wink seductively at Howie Mandel throughout the ceremony, Mandel imagines. A pure white light: An intense yet soothing white light from an unknown source will fill the Kodak Theater during the ceremony, cleansing it entirely of germs. A feat of modern comedy: Robin Williams and George Carlin (whom Mandel will imagine faked his death) will step forward to respectively praise the Oscars broadcast as ""the best single Oscars in history all due to the host"" and ""the defining comedic work of the past century."" Mandel's jokes will be wildly imaginative, sardonic and biting but also good-natured, each one landing perfectly thanks to Mandel's beloved manic delivery. A five-hour broadcast: Mandel's hilarious asides will send the audience into extended fits of laughter that cause the Oscars to run three hours long but no one will care because everyone is having such a good time. Before the telecast has even concluded, Mandel will be deluged with offers from television executives with offers for ten times the amount of money he earns as a judge on ""America's Got Talent,"" a job everyone always knew was beneath him. Mandel's relationship with his father will be mended: Howie Mandel's performance at the imagined Oscar ceremony will finally convince his father Al that his son's career is respectable. Immediately after the ceremony, Al Mandel will appear backstage, where he will greet Howie and tell him that he is sorry for telling Howie at a holiday gathering in 2006 that Howie was embarrassing the family by acting like a 'damn faggoty clown.' Howie Mandel imagines that his father will then hug him and say that he loves him.","entertainment, ifc, blog, vol 47 issue 07, entertainment"

Also, unlike some previous multi-mommies, Zorla doesn't appear desperate for the spotlight. In fact, she can be described as downright reclusive, usually hissing at the paparazzi and emitting an extremely high-pitched tone which melts all nearby plastics whenever a cameraman gets too close. Finally, many fans feel inspired by Zorla's personal story of strength. Not only is Zorla a single mother but she reports she is a recent immigrant to ""this place.""

2106,Study: Family History Of Alcoholism Raises Risk Of One-Man Show,"CHICAGO'According to an alarming new study released Monday by the University of Chicago, children raised in households where alcoholism is present are at a significantly greater risk of writing and performing a one-man show than those who grow up in a more stable environment. The study found that males raised by alcoholic parents are 40 percent more likely to someday force their friends to attend a self-penned theatrical production about their life experiences, and the same painful behavior is eight times more prevalent in women over the age of 30 who have alcoholic fathers than those who do not. According to the report, of the 250 one-man shows that premiered last month, three quarters of them, including Pops, A Life, and Youngstown, Ohio 1976, were directly linked to a relative who abused alcohol. 'Before you know it, they're caught in the self- destructive pattern of doing the show every other Friday. It's really tough to watch.' 'Children who have an alcoholic parent or grandparent can start displaying one-man show warning signs as early as 12,' the study's lead author, Dr. Richard Lowden, told reporters. 'And once these kids develop an interest in theater and start working on impressions of their alcoholic family members, it's a path to disaster.' 'To see them throw their lives away by performing an hour-and-a-half-long monologue for 15 people in a tiny black-box theater is just plain sad,' he added. 'Tragic even.' The study, which asserted that every six seconds an individual from an alcoholic household comes up with the idea to open his one-man show by lighting a cigarette, found that if the urge to incorporate a collage of baby photos into the performance isn't addressed immediately, a young adult may begin experimenting with dangerously melodramatic lines of dialogue, such as, 'You don't really know rock bottom until you hit it,' or, 'People are funny, aren't they?' Soon, the report said, these performers become addicted to the thought of directly quoting a Shel Silverstein poem at the conclusion of their show, and are heavily predisposed toward wearing a baseball cap for the sequence in which they portray their father showing up drunk to little-league practice. 'By the time they realize how pathetic they look reenacting a family dinner scene by themselves, it's already too late,' Lowden said. 'Before you know it, they're caught in the self- destructive pattern of doing the show every other Friday. It's really tough to watch.' 'The worst part is they are completely oblivious as to how much they are hurting not just themselves, but everyone around them,' Lowden said. 'Especially their loved ones, the people who feel obligated to attend the show more than once and then awkwardly tell them how good it was afterwards.' According to the study, the magnitude of the family's bout with alcoholism is directly related to the length of the production, the number of accents performed, and how much screaming the actor is likely to do on stage. A performer who grew up with two alcoholic parents is at a much greater risk of wearing a wig during the show. 'Kids who come from households where alcoholism led to violence or sexual abuse are in danger of having the absolute worst one-man shows,' Lowden said. 'Ones where the performer puts his own clever little spin on the pre-show turn-off-your-cell-phone announcement. Or ones where the actor plays his guitar. Ugh, just the absolute worst.' A report released Tuesday by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said that alcoholism is the third leading contributor to one-man shows, outpacing having immigrant parents, surviving cancer, and having an ex-girlfriend. A desire to be the center of attention paired with a delusional belief in one's talent remain the leading causes of one-man shows. 'These kids need to know that having an alcoholic parent doesn't mean they are predetermined to perform a one-man show,' University of Virginia psychologist Harriet Courtly said. 'They have a choice. They can engage in this embarrassing, hurtful behavior, or they can drink themselves to death and keep it to themselves like everyone else.'","entertainment, news, vol 47 issue 50, entertainment"

2108,Winona Ryder Finally Agrees To Sleep With Generation X,"LOS ANGELES'After being a subject of Generation X desire for the better part of two decades, actress Winona Ryder announced Tuesday that she had finally conceded to having intercourse with every interested member within that age group. ""Fine,"" Ryder said in a statement addressed to the 71 million American men and women born between the years 1962 and 1981. ""For more than 20 years, I've had to endure the yearnings of an entire generation of people, so I suppose I owe it to them to finally offer some relief. After all, they've avidly followed my career all this time. I figure it's the least I can do to repay them."" ""Soup's on, boys,"" she added. ""Get it while it's hot."" Ryder, the offbeat 39-year-old star of such films as Mermaids and Reality Bites, first stirred sexual longing in Generation X with her 1988 appearance as the alienated and slightly goth teen Lydia in Beetlejuice. Her portrayal of brainy outsiders in the cult films Heathers and Welcome Home, Roxy Carmichael cemented her place in the pantheon of the generation's sexually desirable quirky women. The actress told reporters that the order in which she would sleep with participating members of Generation X would be determined by lottery, and that her offer could be redeemed anywhere participants chose, including their old bedroom from when they were in high school or the backseat of their parents' late-1980s station wagon. ""I will cut my hair to its 1993 length, and we can talk about anything you want before we do it,"" Ryder said. ""Fears for the future, your frustration at having to be part of the corporate machine, anything. We can even listen to period-appropriate music of your choice. Except for Soul Asylum. That is off the table."" Children of the so-called Baby Boomers, Generation X has been characterized as a group unable to speak about anything unironically, while also possessing a mistrust of authority and a longing to have sex with Winona Ryder. According to Ryder, this demographic deserves to have ""at least one"" of its thwarted hopes and dreams for itself actually come true. Those born after 1981 are excluded from Ryder's offer unless they can prove that they, too, experienced the profound ennui associated with walking home alone from the movie theater after seeing Edward Scissorhands and knowing they would probably never have her. ""I am not taking this lightly,"" said Ryder, who has only done one nude scene in her entire career. ""This came about after years of careful consideration and hearing from every single person within 10 years of my age that they had a crush on me. If I'm going to do it, it's going to be with the same passion I bring to my acting. Added Ryder, ""To be honest, I've always had sort of a crush on Generation X myself."" The response to Ryder's announcement in the Gen-X community has so far been swift and enthusiastic, with many in the usually sullen age group reacting with great surprise and anticipation. ""Wow,"" freelance writer T. Eric Mayhew said as he hurriedly ran his fingers through his unruly hair after being informed that he had drawn lottery number 9,310. ""I'd better shave."" To date, nearly 40 percent of the people identified as members of Generation X have registered to have sex with Ryder, many under pseudonyms in order to protect the families they established when they gave up all hope of ever sleeping with the actress. ""I kind of lost interest when she did that movie where she was dating Richard Gere,"" said Generation X member Don Bloomfield, 41, who is number 789,834 on the list. ""I didn't even realize I still had a thing for her until I saw Bram Stoker's Dracula on cable last year."" ""I just hope that, before she has to sleep with the next guy, we have time to hold each other and she can tell me that I can make a difference in this world,"" Bloomfield added. As prospective lovers sign up in droves, a few American males aged 30 to 49 have opted to decline Ryder's offer. ""It's tempting, but I've been down that road before,"" Generation X member Johnny Depp, 47, said. ""Besides, I weirdly always had more of a thing for Janeane Garofalo.""","entertainment, our annual year 2011, news, vol 47 issue 03, entertainment"

2119,Josh Hartnett Returns To Pearl Harbor For First Time Since Film,"PEARL HARBOR, HI'Still haunted by the horrific images seared into his memory, an emotional Josh Hartnett returned to the scene of Pearl Harbor Tuesday, choking back tears as he revisited the site of one of the worst atrocities in American history. ""I felt like I needed to come back here for closure,"" Hartnett said. ""For 10 years, I've been waking up in the middle of the night, panicked from the same nightmare in which I experience Pearl Harbor all over again."" ""Everyone knows Pearl Harbor was a terrible, terrible thing,"" Hartnett added. ""But they can't truly fathom how awful it was unless they were actually there."" Hartnett, who was just 22 years old at the time of the atrocity, described the experience as a never-ending stretch of misery that seemed like something from a bad movie. Explaining that at the time he was merely doing what was asked of him by those in charge, Hartnett said he has always been tormented by the unspeakable acts he witnessed in Pearl Harbor. Wracked with guilt, he has questioned the errors in judgment that allowed the three-hour tragedy to occur in the first place. ""Of course it affected the whole country, but I have to live with it every day of my life,"" said Hartnett, surveying the place where a cruel and delusional egomaniac directed the disgraceful attack on American culture. ""The truth is, we were never prepared for an atrocity of this magnitude, and I guess it all happened so quickly that we never had a chance. Even now, all these years later, it makes me sick just thinking about it."" ""I talk to my buddy Ben about it sometimes'he understands,"" Hartnett added. ""We were in that shit together."" Hartnett told reporters he regretted the way he acted during Pearl Harbor and knew that he could never take back some of the ""horrible, just awful"" things he said and did. He also expressed anger and frustration when recalling the senseless plot that ruined the lives of so many promising young men and women. The visit to Pearl Harbor dredged up a number of painful memories for Hartnett, who vividly recalled the overblown attack, the excessive explosions, and the doomed faces of those around him. ""All those scared and confused voices, all that yelling'it's still fresh in my mind,"" Hartnett said. ""It was just shot after shot and like eight million things getting blown up at once. It was appalling. And so loud. It seemed to go on for an eternity."" Looking out at the quiet and peaceful water, Hartnett told reporters that he considered himself lucky to have survived Pearl Harbor reasonably intact, a feeling he said is shared by the others who somehow made it out of the disaster in one piece. ""We all want to put it behind us and move on,"" Hartnett added. ""You never hear Cuba Gooding Jr., Jon Voight, or Alec Baldwin mention Pearl Harbor. They just freeze up and get real quiet when you bring it up."" Hartnett then fell to his knees, started sobbing, and screamed ""Why?"" after the sight of a hangar reminded him of the calculated and brutal inhumanity of Pearl Harbor's insipid love triangle.","entertainment, news, vol 47 issue 02, entertainment"

""The bomb should not have gone off at all,"" said lead producer Michael Cohl, adding that the explosion that vaporized most of Manhattan was ""not that unusual"" for a major Broadway show still in development. ""Spider-Man is supposed to swing down to the stage and deactivate a nuclear bomb, but his wires got tangled up, and by the time he got there and remembered the disarm code, it was too late. We're going to hire two more stagehands to make sure this doesn't happen again."" Despite the setback, Cohl told reporters that he is more optimistic than ever about the production, saying that director Julie Taymor and composers Bono and the Edge were disintegrated in the explosion.","entertainment, our annual year 2011, news in brief, vol 47 issue 01, entertainment"

2179,African-American Community Calls For New Black Nerd Archetype,"Hollywood Blasted For Failure To Portray Modern Dorks Of Color LOS ANGELES'A coalition of African-American activists and scholars released a strongly worded statement Monday citing the ""urgent need"" for popular media to depict a new black nerd archetype that more accurately reflects the full spectrum of 21st-century American dorkdom. ""Outdated representations of African-American nerds are simply not cutting it anymore,"" the statement read in part. ""Perhaps in the '80s and '90s it was possible for young people to identify with Steve Urkel's hiked-up pants, nasal voice, and lovable catchphrase of 'Did I do that?' But today's black nerds are different."" ""They may not carry slide rules and calculators, but they do carry smartphones to make posts on Twitter, Facebook, and Foursquare,"" the statement continued. ""Yet where are the modern-day nerds of color in our films and television programs?"" According to the Dweeb Diversity Coalition, nerds in the African-American community continue, like their predecessors, to be socially awkward, hilariously unstylish, and a source of embarrassment for their cooler black friends. But a recent survey of pop-cultural archetypes found that in the current TV lineup, almost all nerd characters are white. There is the exception, coalition members noted, of Abed from the sitcom Community'a character, they also observed, who is not of African or Caribbean descent. Meanwhile, the popular nerd action-comedy Chuck stars a white ""geek-chic"" computer whiz, and the all-nerd cast of The Big Bang Theory is overwhelmingly Anglo-American, apart from one Indian and one Jewish nerd. ""Even more offensively, on Glee, the black nerds are notably cooler than their white counterparts, as if black geekiness is somehow less lame than white geekiness,"" Professor Cornel West of Princeton University told reporters Monday. ""To add insult to injury, the one black man on the show was written out after the first season."" The prominent African-American writer, philosopher, and activist went on to stress that the highest-profile nerds in today's media'Jesse Eisenberg and Michael Cera chief among them'are exclusively white. According to West, this leaves many nonwhite nerds feeling as though they have no option but to follow in the footsteps of suspect characters such as the reactionary Carlton Banks, who still appears in syndicated reruns of The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air. ""And remember, we haven't seen a black gay dork on the screen since Lamar in Revenge Of The Nerds, more than a quarter century ago,"" West said. ""When will young black gay dorks be able to look up to something besides Lamar's victorious turn throwing the wobbling flexi-javelin designed by his engineering-major friends to complement his limp-wristed throwing style?"" Baratunde Thurston, a black nerd residing in New York City, complained about the limited diversity in his favorite TV programs. ""There are any number of African-Americans on Friday Night Lights,"" Thurston said of the Emmy-nominated drama about a racially integrated high school football team. ""Unfortunately, all the black characters are charismatic, sexy athletes. The only nerd, Landry, is'what do you expect?'white. What's a young black nerd supposed to make of that?"" His sentiment was echoed by the coalition's statement, which lamented the media's inability to reinvent the societal paradigm of the African-American dorkwad. ""Right now, there are only three major role models in American society for black children to aspire to: the gangsta rapper, the pro basketball player, and the president of the United States,"" the statement concluded. ""And that is just sad.""","entertainment, community, news, vol 46 issue 44, entertainment"

2198,Bored Entertainment Media Decides To Go After Ray Liotta With All They've Got,"HOLLYWOOD, CA'Citing a general feeling of boredom, as well as a lack of anything better to do, members of the celebrity news media announced this week that they have decided to put all other stories on hold and use every resource at their disposal to go after veteran film and television actor Ray Liotta. ""It's been kind of a slow month, so we figured, 'Hey, how about we harass the ever-loving shit out of Ray Liotta for a while?'"" Star magazine editor-in-chief Candace Trunzo told reporters at a press conference Monday. ""So that's exactly what my publication and every other celebrity news organization in the country is going to do. We're going to pin this son of a bitch down, pop 3,000 flashbulbs right in his eyeballs, and make every waking moment of his life a living hell."" ""Some of you may be asking, 'Why would you do this? Why would you completely ruin Ray Liotta?'"" Trunzo added. ""And to those people I can only say, 'Why the fuck not?'"" Following the announcement, hundreds of entertainment reporters from across the country converged on Liotta's Pacific Palisades home, where they have remained camped for the past 72 hours. During this time, the 55-year-old actor has reportedly emerged on six occasions, each time facing a sustained onslaught of questions on topics ranging from his career, to his hair, to the state of his relationship with his ex-wife, Michelle. Sources said that after leaving his home yesterday morning, Liotta was immediately pursued to an optometrist appointment by a convoy of news vans, photographers on motorcycles, and helicopters, all of which trailed him until he finally returned later that evening. At press time, every tabloid, entertainment news program, and celebrity gossip blog in the nation was inexplicably running material de-voted exclusively to Liotta, in some cases providing extensive updates two or three times per minute. ""We're going to be up this guy's ass for as long as it takes: all Liotta, all the time,"" E! chief news correspondent Ken Baker said as he supervised a camera crew peering over Liotta's backyard fence. ""We're hoping he snaps and tries to hit somebody. If he does, we got a whole bunch of stories lined up: 'Ragin' Ray,' 'A Whole Liotta Anger,' 'Badfella,' etc. Then we'll show a clip of him from Goodfellas pistol-whipping that guy in the driveway and we'll run it every goddamned day for a month and he will never, ever live it down for as long as he lives."" ""Fucking asshole piece of shit celebrity,"" Baker added. ""Fucking Ray Liotta."" In an effort to ""push [Liotta] to the very edge of sanity,"" People magazine announced plans to run an 80-page cover story on ""The Sick, Pathetic Little World of Ray Liotta,"" complete with embarrassing revelations about the actor's allegedly ""sordid"" private life and a series of personal text-message exchanges appearing beneath the heading ""We Own You."" In addition, TMZ.com said it had obtained exclusive telephoto-lens images of Liotta's genitals taken while he was changing in a locker room after a swim. ""We've got all kinds of shit ready to go,"" said Us Weekly assistant editor Jason Peurifoy. ""We forged a sex tape. We dug up some ex-girlfriend from the '80s and paid her a bunch of money to say Ray was abusive. We Photoshopped some kind of 'proof' that he's had plastic surgery. And why? Because fuck him, that's why."" ""We didn't need a reason when we fucking obliterated Gary Sinise back in '99,"" Peurifoy continued. ""Or Minnie Driver. We slaughtered her for no reason at all. Just didn't like her face."" When the famously anger-prone Liotta was reached for comment by The Onion, he unleashed one of his notorious Liotta-in-a-china-shop wild tirades. ""I really don't know why this is happening,"" said the oh-so-testy thespian, who, according to Onion pedophilia expert Dr. Jeffrey Meisenheimer, may be ""expressing frustration"" over his much-whispered-about secret desire to sexually molest young children. ""Please, I beg of you, just leave me alone."" Talk about Something Wild!

""Obviously, I wasn't expecting them to build an actual working Stargate for him to walk through, but some flashing lights and dry ice or something would've been nice,"" said audience member Glenn Culson, who added that seeing Anderson in a Polo shirt and slacks rather than his official SGC team uniform was also somewhat underwhelming. ""Or the sound. Just play the sound of the Stargate, at least. It wouldn't have been hard."" Some Stargate SG-1 fans pointed out that since O'Neill was promoted and moved to Washington, D.C. in later seasons it actually made sense for Anderson not to utilize the Stargate technology.","entertainment, news in brief, vol 46 issue 41, entertainment"
2212,8-Year-Old Asian Mix Wins Westminster Boy Show,"NEW YORK'Danny, an 8-year-old Asian mix from Sterling, VA, beat out 2,500 top contenders from around the country Tuesday to win best in show at the 135th annual Westminster Boy Show. Standing in the winners circle before a sold-out crowd at Madison Square Garden, Danny impressed judges and fans alike with his even temperament and self-assured attitude. Handler Kenny Earle said he was not at all surprised by the outcome, describing Danny as the most well-rounded boy he has seen in 17 years of training boys. ""We knew we had a world-class show boy on our hands from the time Danny was 3,"" Earle said after rewarding Danny with a Rice Krispies treat. ""I've worked with Asian mixes extensively, and they tend to be very skittish and shy'especially those from Korean stock. But not Danny. He's always been obedient, polite, and totally confident."" ""None of the other boys out there even came close to him,"" Earle continued. ""Not even that gorgeous Afghan longhair."" According to a citation issued by the judging panel, Danny excelled in every standard for boys in the mixed category, achieving a flawless, even stride while being led around the show ring. Additionally, Danny received top marks for his glossy, healthy-looking bowl cut and perfectly pressed khaki slacks. ""With Asian mixes, what the judges are really looking for is bone structure and lots of personality,"" Westminster show chairman Tom Webb said. ""Danny won his group largely thanks to his prominent cheeks and clean jaw. You could just tell from the moment he started trotting the floor that this boy was going to be a real crowd favorite."" Sources said Danny's victory is especially notable because it marks only the fourth time in the event's history that a boy of mixed pedigree has taken top honors. Purebreds have been the perennial victors, and bigger breeds from the working-boy group'those traditionally used on farms and as golf caddies'have won the past six Westminster shows. Perhaps most surprising to boy aficionados was the judges' decision to award second place to Timothy, a 6-year-old from the Husky group, a category of boys lauded for the entertainment they provide but seldom taken seriously in competition. ""Everyone loves the Husky boys, but they're still viewed as something of a novelty,"" show organizer Shelly Winthrop said of the soft, somewhat clumsy breed often referred to as the clowns of the boy world. ""With their rounded flanks and drooping hindquarters, they tend to breathe heavily while gaiting, which works against them during judging. Hopefully Timothy's showing here today will help these boys get more positive recognition."" ""After all, Husky boys are now the most common type of boy in the country,"" Winthrop added. This year's Westminster Boy Show also had its less-than-triumphant moments, however. Ricky, a 10-year-old from the Bully group, reportedly bit a judge while having his teeth inspected, and Rodney, a favorite to win the Mama's Boy group, stained his short-pant suit when he grew nervous and urinated midway through his trot around the ring. Still, longtime show-boy fans said the 2010 edition included some of the strongest competitors in recent memory. ""This is my fifth time coming, and the boys this year were simply breathtaking,"" spectator Tanya Poole said. ""So frisky and full of life, and just immaculately groomed. Even though they're only boys, you could somehow tell they were having the time of their lives."" Echoing the sentiments of many others, Poole added that she couldn't wait to get home to see her own boy, Jeffrey, and let him out of his crate.","entertainment, news, vol 46 issue 41, entertainment"
2213,ShutterIsland.com Reporting Unexplained Drop In Traffic Since March,"LOS ANGELES'Less than a year after its launch date, the official website for the film Shutter Island continues to experience a steady decline in visitors, a ""baffling"" trend that has persisted since March, ShutterIsland.com employees reported Monday. Perplexed insiders said that despite providing users with full-length theatrical trailers, a synopsis, a link to buy the music from the film, and the ability to share the site on social networking platforms like MySpace, Reddit, and Digg, daily traffic dipped last week to its lowest point in 2010. ""Frankly, we're at a loss to explain what's going on here,"" said site administrator Eric Walsh, poring over a report detailing September's dismal performance. ""We've got all the same great reviews, cast and crew bios, and downloads that made ShutterIsland.com so popular in the first place. What more do people want?"" ""It's like one day they couldn't wait to unravel Shutter Island's haunting secret, and the next they'd completely lost interest,"" he added. Web traffic reportedly saw a gradual but steady climb early this year, particularly when cast members began promoting the film in TV interviews. But on the evening of Friday, Feb. 19, without any warning, page views suddenly plateaued. A week later, they began to plummet. According to sources, a second blow came in April as thousands of fans canceled their subscriptions to the site's newsletter, a weekly e-mail containing updates on the film's press, special events related to its release, and other Shutter Island'related occurrences. Globally, the film's 24 international sites are said to have fared similarly, with interest in each peaking around one specific date before viewers began steadily trickling away. ""We looked into whether our visitors were using older browsers or hadn't updated to the latest version of Flash, but that didn't seem to be the problem,"" Walsh lamented. ""It's possible some users didn't realize you can turn the sound effects on and off, or experience the site in full-screen mode, but I feel like we made those features pretty user-friendly."" Though ShutterIsland.com remains committed to reaching as many people as possible and providing them with the latest Shutter Island news, attempts to stem the loss of traffic, including a prominent reminder that fans can now own the film on Blu-Ray and enjoy never-before-seen features, have so far proven unsuccessful. ""Management is breathing down my neck to boost page hits and I have no idea how we're supposed to do that,"" said promotions manager Brian Holop, acknowledging it was possible people had simply exhausted the site's supply of AOL Instant Messenger icons and desktop wallpapers. ""I pitched a great idea for an interactive map that lets you explore Shutter Island, but they said we don't have the budget for it."" ""Meanwhile, a friend of mine over at Saw3DMovie.com says business there has never been better,"" he continued. ""Their numbers are through the roof, and that movie hasn't even come out yet."" Employees have reportedly begun asking difficult questions about ShutterIsland.com's future. Some have openly wondered whether it's time to remove the once-popular Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese featurettes, which, sources conceded, have neither been e-mailed nor embedded in any blogs since April. Others have floated the idea of posting an interview with cast member Mark Ruffalo about how difficult it was to film in the rain. ""Maybe the Internet is changing, or maybe people aren't interested in staying up-to-date on one of the year's most thrilling blockbusters anymore,"" Holop said. ""But the reality is, every site has its ups and downs, and this is probably just a small bump in the road."" Added Holop, ""Either way, the 'Which Shutter Island Cast Member Are You?' quiz will surely turn things around.""","entertainment, news, vol 46 issue 40, entertainment"

2222,Script Has Been Floating Around Hollywood For 75 Years,"Has Had More Than 250 Stars And 300 Directors Attached, Been Rewritten 600 Times BURBANK, CA'According to Hollywood sources, Warner Bros. Entertainment officially acquired the rights this week to the long- unproduced film project entitled The Final Symphony, which has reportedly been floating around in various states of production with seven different studios since 1935. The script, believed to have been originally written seven and a half decades ago as a vehicle for Clark Gable, has since undergone at least 600 drafts by 2,250 different writers, and was at various times attached to hundreds of different Hollywood stars, including Spencer Tracy, Paul Muni, Tyrone Power, Montgomery Clift, Sidney Poitier, Burt Reynolds, Dudley Moore, Cher, Liam Neeson, and Justin Long. Film historians said the script has been making the rounds as a hot Hollywood property for so long that no one currently working in the American film industry can remember its exact genesis. ""It's impossible to say who the original screenwriter was, because the original director, along with most of the people who worked at the studio at that time, has been dead for well over 30 years,"" film historian Richard Schickel said of the movie, which has been known variously over the years as The Vengeance, Hearts On Fire, Final Symphony 3D, ¡Arriba, Arriba!, Finding Billy Harper, Boogly, and Untitled Eric Roberts Project. ""Besides, so much has changed since then that the original script would probably be pretty hard to recognize."" ""It supposedly had a crackerjack supporting role written for Basil Rathbone in it, though,"" Schickel added. ""Which was subsequently rewritten for Mickey Rooney, and later Gene Wilder and then Chris Tucker."" Continued Schickel, ""And then Rob Schneider, Wanda Sykes, and Jonah Hill."" According to dozens of sources who have read some version of the script in the past 75 years, the film concerns a soldier coming home from war and, depending on which version of the script sources saw, is either a ""seriocomic love story,"" a ""brooding psychological thriller,"" a ""wild cinematic joyride for the post-Tarantino generation,"" or ""a propaganda film financed by the War Department."" Nearly every major Hollywood movie studio has previously owned the rights to the script, including Warner Bros. itself, which bought the screenplay from MGM in 1951 when it was an unproduced Vincente Minnelli musical, sold it to Paramount a short time later, and then bought it from MGM again in 1962 before selling it back to Paramount as a Jerry Lewis army comedy the following year. ""There was a period in the late '60s where nobody knew who had it, and it turned out Darryl Zannuck had sold it to a Hong Kong studio that tried to make it into some sort of martial-arts costume drama,"" said Final Symphony scholar and onetime would-be Final Symphony director Peter Bogdanovich. ""But the funding fell through and it eventually found its way back to America, where, oddly, Charlie Chaplin, I believe, who was quite old at the time, tried to make it as a sort of comeback project."" Throughout the 1950s, Orson Welles famously attempted to helm the project under the title The Reckoning Of Madison Creek, funneling millions of dollars of his own money into the project and eventually bankrupting himself, an experience chronicled in the Oscar-winning 1978 documentary The Reckoning Of Orson Welles. ""This being America, we all have our white whales, so to speak, and that script was mine,"" Welles said in the documentary. ""I still believe it would make a great picture, though. The third act needs work, sure, but goddamn it I'd love to take a crack at it again if I could just get the financing."" While Warner Bros. executives are reportedly happy with the shape the script is in, they said it would receive one final last-minute rewrite from screenwriters Scott Frank and Steven Kloves, as well as a polish from veteran writer William Goldman, who drafted a full rewrite of the script in 1966 when it was being conceived as a buddy picture for Robert Redford and Paul Newman, and did so again when it was being considered as a possible California Raisins claymation feature film in 1989. ""It's been a bit of a rocky road for this project, but we intend to begin shooting very soon,"" Warner Bros. CEO Barry Meyer said. ""David Fincher had to pull out due to a scheduling conflict, but we are currently looking at a number of other directors, including Danny Boyle and David O. Russell."" ""Although Russell will only do it if we can get Jack Nicholson to commit for the role of the father, which is unlikely considering he passed on the part of the son in 1969,"" Meyer continued. ""In any event, we should be all systems go for sometime around spring 2015.""","entertainment, news, vol 46 issue 39, entertainment"

2231,Rocky Horror Picture Show's Cult Following Just Doesn't Have The Energy Anymore,"LOS ANGELES'Longtime fans of the 1975 cult classic The Rocky Horror Picture Show reported this week that after 30 years of religiously attending midnight showings of the film, they no longer have the energy to put on red wigs, bras, and lipstick and yell things at a movie screen until two in the morning. Describing the never-ending ritual of gathering together with fellow fans and re-watching the camp musical comedy as ""tiring"" and ""frankly, a little pathetic,"" thousands of once-obsessed Rocky Horror fans across the country made it known that their enthusiasm for the whole cult following in general was beginning to wane. ""I'm just exhausted,"" said Los Angeles attorney Chris Bendel, 51, who has viewed the film with dozens of other mainly middle-aged audience members on an estimated 246 separate occasions. ""Sure, there was a time when the idea of standing up in my seat and singing along with 'Dammit Janet' seemed like the greatest thing in the world, but now the mere thought of having to do it all again next week actually fills me with dread. I am a grown man. What am I doing?"" ""The last screening I went to I sat there the entire time thinking, 'This movie isn't even that great and I kind of feel like an asshole,'"" Bendel added. Citing hours of missed sleep, thousands of dollars wasted on props and costumes, and an overall leveling out of whatever crazed, youthful energy got them so obsessed in the first place, the entire extended fan base of the film has called for a rethinking of the midnight-screening premise itself. ""Would it kill them to play it three or four times a year instead of every single week?"" asked Tom McDougal, 47, who claimed that after a long day at work, staying up all night with 40 near-strangers dressed as sweet transvestites was ""not exactly thrilling"" anymore. ""How about maybe doing a matinee every once in a while? Jesus Christ, I fell asleep last week during 'Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me.'"" In addition, numerous Rocky Horror enthusiasts stated this week that the dozens of audience-participation rituals invented for the screenings over the years had long ago lost their magic, and were now simply a chore. Fan Deborah Wright, 39, announced that she will no longer be going to Shop 'n Save to pick up a loaf of bread in order to make toast to throw at the screen when the line ""A toast!"" is spoken. And Chicago-area computer programmer Rob Levin told reporters he was tired of bringing bags of rice, hot dogs, and toilet paper to local screenings, citing the fact that he is a 47-year-old man with a wife and child. ""I actually go out and spend money on supplies for this thing,"" Levin said. ""Supplies. For a movie. How idiotic is that?"" Rocky Horror fan club president Sal Piro addressed concerns at a press conference Monday, saying that he shared fans' growing lack of interest, and that the film itself was to blame. ""Look, for decades there wasn't a bigger Rocky Horror nut on the planet than me,"" Piro said. ""But my tastes have changed over time, and I've got to be honest with myself: The Rocky Horror Picture Show is actually a pretty irritating movie, and the music, while admittedly catchy on first listen, really starts to grate over time. And dressing up like Dr. Frank-N-Furter or Riff Raff and prancing around like an over-caffeinated teenager doesn't make the movie any better, it just compounds everything that is already annoying about it."" ""So really, this whole thing has been a colossal waste of time,"" Piro continued. ""And now it appears as though the better part of my life is over, so, there you go. There's your fucking 'time warp' right there.","entertainment, news, vol 46 issue 38, entertainment"

2240,"My Sister Actually Went To School With Ryan Reynolds' Brother vs. Cool, I Like You More As A Person Now","You know, it's funny that you mention Ryan Reynolds, because my sister actually went to the same college as Ryan Reynolds' brother. Yeah, my sister Stephanie. You've met her. Remember, at the barbecue over at Josh's place last summer, when she and her husband were in town for the Fourth of July? Yeah. Anyway, she went to school with Ryan Reynolds' brother. I mean, she didn't know him all that well. The brother. His name is Greg. Yeah, Greg Reynolds. But she knew him because they had the same Astronomy 101 class. Yeah, astronomy. I know, right? You wouldn't think she would be into astronomy at all, the way she partied! But I guess they had to take something for the science requirement, and astronomy had the least math, so a lot of people ended up taking that one. Interesting thing is, when she met him, she didn't even know he was related to Ryan Reynolds at all. She just thought of him as this guy Greg. It was like halfway through the semester and she was talking to her roommate, Kendra or something? Kirsten? I can't even remember her roommate's name anymore, but apparently, she explained to my sister that she had seen this guy Greg at a keg party in her dorm, and Ryan Reynolds was there! Yeah, I guess he was visiting his brother for the weekend or something. She said he was totally cool. Yeah, and after the keg party was out, apparently he went out with them all to the bar and bought everybody a round on him. From what my sister said, apparently he was totally down to earth, didn't act like a big deal or anything, just a regular guy. I think this was after he was with Alanis Morissette, because apparently he had some girlfriend there with him, visiting, but it wasn't Alanis Morissette. But yeah, anyway. Ryan Reynolds' brother. Pretty crazy. Really, your sister went to college with Ryan Reynolds' brother? That is amazing. I like you so much more as a human being now that you've explained that to me. Your social standing, in my eyes, has just skyrocketed due to your tertiary association with this famous person, whose name I recognize, and whom I've seen in movies. I'm not sure if this was your intention when you related that anecdote to me, but I am much, much more interested in talking to you now that Ryan Reynolds has entered the equation. Pardon me for a moment while I sit back and try to take this new information in, and fully recognize just how much it changes everything between us. I want to hear more about you now. I am more interested in you, and in being your friend, after having heard about the connection between you and Ryan Reynolds. He is a person in celebrity culture magazines. But this is no magazine: This is real life. And that's precisely what makes it so astounding. You, through your sister, are associated, albeit distantly, with Ryan Reynolds, and therefore, I want to be associated with you. Can we hang out more often now? Maybe, somehow, your social link with Ryan Reynolds will be transferred to me, and I will then be that much closer to the magical world of celebrity and fame, through knowing you. You see, not everybody has a social link to a famous person. And famous people are special because they are famous and more important than regular people. Thus, the fact that you have a sister who went to school with Ryan Reynolds' brother, and the fact that Ryan Reynolds is a movie star, means that you yourself are more important and interesting as a person, and that I am too, by virtue of the fact that I know you. Moreover, your relating to me a salient detail concerning Ryan Reynold's romantic history impresses me greatly, as it further illustrates the fact that you have a higher level of access to the life of movie star Ryan Reynolds than the average person does. I am going to tell all of my friends and acquaintances about this, and they will all be envious and want to know more. Not just about Ryan Reynolds, but about you, and how I know you, and how well I know you. Then they will tell their friends and they will all be envious too, and they will respect me more as a person because I know you, just as I respect you more because you have a sister who went to the same college as Greg Reynolds, brother of Ryan Reynolds. Then they will want to know more about me, and so on. Thank God you told me this. Otherwise, I would never have known I should like you more. I feel so much better about myself by knowing you. Thank you. From the bottom of my heart, sincerely'thank you.","opinion, entertainment, back to school 2010, point/counterpoint, vol 46 issue 37, erin bachelder, marissa lange, entertainment"

2258,Martin Scorsese Attends Free iMovie Demonstration At Apple Store,"NEW YORK'Filmmaker Martin Scorsese went to a free iMovie demonstration at the Apple Store Wednesday, attentively watching the tutorial for the video-editing software from a front-row seat, sources reported. Scorsese, who won the 2006 Academy Award for best director, reportedly interrupted the presentation more than a dozen times to ask questions about importing footage, creating on-screen titles, and adding sound effects. According to Apple Store employees, the 67-year-old film legend regularly jotted down notes on a yellow legal pad while the moderator demonstrated the step-by-step process for creating movies on a Macintosh. ""Importing, editing, post-production'they got it all on the computer,"" said Scorsese, who arrived 20 minutes early for the in-store workshop. ""I like it. You can make your pictures right on there, it's tremendous."" ""And it's so intuitive, my gosh,"" Scorsese added. ""You just take your shots and you drag and drop them'drag, drop, drag, drop, wherever you want them to go. It's going to make things so much easier for me and [longtime editor] Thelma [Schoonmaker]."" Scorsese, who is widely regarded as one of the most important artists in the history of American cinema, was reportedly fascinated that iMovie was capable of making footage slow down, speed up, or play backward. The living legend said he was also impressed that, by clicking a single button, a complex tracking shot could be instantly changed into black-and-white to fully emphasize the repugnance of masculine insecurities. ""I haven't been this enamored of a title screen since my mother took me to see Duel In The Sun when I was 6,"" said Scorsese, standing up to address the iMovie demonstrator and the audience. ""So just to clarify, all I have to do is go to the title menu, type a word, and that will be superimposed over the screen? That's just an extraordinary feature. Look at that, you can make words scroll like credits at the end of a movie. Wait until I tell Brian De Palma about this."" Scorsese reportedly approached the Apple employee after the demonstration and obtained his e-mail address so he could send him any additional questions he might have. ""He was very enthusiastic about how quickly a Hollywood-style movie could be made,"" said Jared Brunner, 26, who gave the presentation. ""He kept talking about how it was going to change the nature of filmmaking, because iMovie allows for effortless self- expression, and then he started listing all these obscure directors."" ""Every time I do one of these things there's a guy like him,"" Brunner added. While viewing the sample movie Day At The Beach, Scorsese inquired about adding a soundtrack to the clip to fully capture the emotional impact of Jenny falling in the sand as she dives for the volleyball. ""You can get Derek and the Dominos, the Rolling Stones, the Ronettes, anybody you want,"" Scorsese said. ""You just take the song you want from your iTunes program and then you can line it up so the music starts playing right when everyone gathers around the bonfire. Boy, that's really something."" After learning that the Apple music application GarageBand could be used to compose original scores for iMovie, Scorsese reportedly contacted Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee Robbie Robertson, guitarist for The Band, and urged him to attend a tutorial for the software. Eyewitnesses reported overhearing Scorsese repeatedly yell ""You can record your own songs, Robbie!"" into a pay phone outside the Apple Store. Scorsese announced that he's currently developing a $70 million remake of the iMovie classic The Dog Wash.","entertainment, news, vol 46 issue 34, entertainment"

2266,"Hollywood Rangers To Manage Overpopulation Problem By Killing Off 1,200 Celebrities","HOLLYWOOD, CA'Calling current population levels ""wildly unsustainable,"" rangers from the Federal Bureau of Celebrity Conservation announced this week their plan to eliminate some 1,200 celebrities from the Hollywood region. While FBCC sources said the number of indigenous celebrities in the region has been increasing steadily since the 1950s, rangers said the past decade in particular has seen an alarming spike in the population due to the rampant spawning of celebrities via the Internet and reality television, leaving the agency no recourse but targeted exterminations. ""Despite our best efforts, Hollywood star levels have been pushed far beyond what is manageable,"" Head Ranger Art McWane told reporters at a Monday press conference. ""Every day we see more and more of them cropping up, and our safest option at this point is a drastic policy aimed at culling their numbers."" ""Population control is the only humane course of action,"" McWane added. ""If we don't intervene now, we will soon be completely overrun by celebrities."" Under the terms of the program, a corps of rangers is patrolling a 30-mile radius centered on the Sunset Strip and has begun to find and eliminate celebrities. At press time, some 20 stars, including Paul Sorvino, Billy Crudup, American Idol winner David Cook, and Khloé Karadashian had been killed and placed in special disposal bins for incineration. Rangers said they have attempted nonlethal methods of population containment in the past, but that their efforts met with little success. ""Unfortunately, the sterilization programs of a generation ago failed to prevent Miley Cyrus, Jaden Smith, and countless other second-generation stars, so we're left with no choice now,"" McWane said. ""But rest assured, population-thinning will be quick and efficient, while primarily targeting the sick, elderly, and C-list."" McWane then ended the press conference by fatally shooting actor Beau Bridges with a .44 hunting rifle. To assist the overburdened federal officials, Los Angeles County has begun offering permits that will allow city residents using registered weapons to kill any current SAG or AFTRA member, with a limit of 1,000 pounds of celebrity per license. However, special restrictions on the use of automatic weapons, as well as hunting in rehab facilities, will continue to apply under the rules of the Fair Chase code. Many Hollywood locals have called the move long overdue. ""The way things have been, even an A-lister can wait 45 minutes for a table,"" said Tracey Spillane, manager of Spago Beverly Hills. ""And from the table chatter we overhear, there just aren't enough projects in the pipeline for the glut of celebrities that exist right now. Believe me, this is a much more compassionate approach than leaving Anson Williams to root in the Dumpster for scraps."" Ranger Paul Cummings agreed, saying few of today's celebrities have any skills other than their notoriety and, left to their own devices, will often continue to breed in a desperate, last-ditch bid to live vicariously through the fame of offspring. Cummings called the federal action an attempt to succeed at managing the population where Hollywood's countless talent agencies and PR firms have failed. Many hunters, including Willard Byrne of Lynwood, are excited about the opportunity to bag some prize specimens. ""There's nothing I enjoy more than a good hunt, so this is a dream come true for me,"" Byrne said while caping and field-dressing MAD TV's Aries Spears at the corner of La Cienega and Wilshire Boulevards. ""What better way to teach my son about the cycle of life than to camp out on Sunset and pick off the cast of Grey's Anatomy one by one?"" Whether the program is useful in finally bringing the star population under control remains to be seen. In the meantime, Hollywood rangers are confident that their plan to reintroduce Charles Manson to the area this fall will help maintain the natural order for the foreseeable future.","entertainment, news, vol 46 issue 33, entertainment"

Weiss, who spoke out loud for nearly four and a half hours as if there were other people in his general vicinity, noted that the series never had network support, and that seasons six and seven would have brought the Jerry O'Connell vehicle to a proper close. Sliders was canceled in 2000. ""Two seasons'44 more episodes'that's all we needed,"" Weiss said as he sat alone in his Los Angeles home, his voice echoing off the living room walls. ""So many threads were left hanging: Sure we know Quinn's mom is safe, but how safe? After Rembrandt injected himself with the virus, was he able to kill the Kromaggs?"" ""Another season also would have given us the chance to explore the fanatical religion of Slidology further,"" added Weiss, who was more than 600 yards away from the nearest human being. ""Much further."" According to Weiss, who even gesticulated as if he were engaging another person in a face-to-face conversation, the producer could have used the extra seasons to return the show to its alternate-history roots. The former showrunner told his bathroom mirror reflection that he had ideas for parallel-reality episodes in which the atomic bomb has never been used, yo-yos are the primary form of entertainment, and the Ku Klux Klan is made up entirely of African-Americans. ""Allegory is a powerful method for examining society,"" Weiss said with no regard for the standard communication model in which a sender relays a message to a receiver. ""If given the chance, me and the whole Sliders creative team would have loved to tackle 9/11. Some shows would have been too afraid to touch it. But not Sliders. We were fearless."" Weiss continued his uninterrupted monologue as he exited his house, got into his car, and drove to a Santa Monica diner and explained to nobody that with 2,000 additional minutes of airtime he could have finally revisited how Logan St. Clair lost touch with the gang after they switched timers in the season-three episode ""Slide Like An Egyptian."" ""It's a fickle business,"" said Weiss, an empty booth before him. ""I was talking to [series cocreator] Tracy [Tormé] the other day and we already have a finale in mind. Imagine this: Quinn and Wade get married on a planet that can only sustain life for two more days. And the final shot is of our Sliders arriving through the gateway and we discover we were watching the other Sliders throughout the entire show. Awesome, right?"" Weiss then meandered through the Farmers Market, down Fairfax Avenue, and along the beach, his words often devolving into muttered sentence fragments, including, ""Second Earth Prime? Could work,"" ""Simple phone call and Jerry [O'Connell] would have come back for season six,"" and ""Canceled? Fuck you, I'm canceled. You're canceled."" Records confirmed that, in the past seven years, Weiss is the only person to speak aloud about Sliders. Standing at the edge of the Santa Monica Pier, with seagulls the closest living organisms capable of hearing him, the producer discussed a potential five-episode arc in which the Kromaggs successfully convince the Sliders that they never slid away from Earth Prime in the first place. He later refined the idea in a desolate downtown alleyway, telling some leaky water pipes that it might be better if just Quinn remembers sliding and the other don't. ""That could be good for dramatic tension. Hey, where am I? Anyway, Sliders was way ahead of its time,"" added Weiss, who later returned to his empty house, lay on his bed, and turned off his bedroom light. ""The bottom line is that the fans deserve closure.""","entertainment, news, vol 46 issue 29, entertainment"

""The corrosive voyeurism incited and succored by this YouTube, and the attendant vomitous mush which masquerades as commentary thereupon, is perhaps the keenest example of the debasement of American discourse, dragging our last guttering ideas of community and fellowship through the electric muck,"" Twain writes in one paragraph before turning his attention to international matters just two pages later. ""As concerns British Petroleum's continued putrefaction of the seas, it is the largest stain yet on the corrupted idea of the world as a market'that same lustful, self-concerned greed in the guise of idealism that perverts our young idealists into thuggish hatchet-men, misled, betrayed, and fated to gasp the blood of their final heartbeats into the Afghani dust."" Editors noted that several passages did display guarded optimism for the innovations of new media, warm affirmation for the ""generous and great-hearted nature"" of health care reform, and enthusiastic praise for High Violet, the latest album by indie-rock favorites the National.","entertainment, news in brief, vol 46 issue 28, entertainment"

""We regret that [Starz] chose to end such an original program at the height of its viewership and right when Henry was finally making strides in his acting career,"" FCC chair Julius Genachowski said. ""The FCC remains committed to serving the public good, and after sitting idly by while Veronica Mars and Firefly got dumped before they were able to find their audiences, we could not let Party Down suffer the same fate.

2344,Children Of All Ages Delighted By Enslavement Of Topsy The Elephant,"TUCSON, AZ'Cheers, laughter, and applause filled the big top tent at the Ringling Bros. Circus Saturday as children of all ages were captivated by the savage enslavement of Topsy the elephant. Whether young or just young at heart, thrilled audience members watched with glee as a circus trainer forced the frightened Topsy to perform tricks by brutally poking and prodding the traumatized 4-year-old pachyderm. ""He's such a funny happy elephant,"" said 8-year-old Madison Helms, referring to the abused creature that spends the majority of his time chained up in a cramped, feces-covered enclosure. ""He loves being in the circus!"" The crowd reportedly let out loud gasps and vigorously clapped when Topsy stood up on his hind legs, an unnatural and excruciatingly painful movement that stresses and permanently damages the 8,000-pound elephant's joints. Topsy also delighted the audience after the trainer repeatedly thrust a hooked rod into his skin, causing the miserable animal to lift one leg and his trunk to simulate waving. ""AwwEE""aid the assembled circus-goers, who were taken by the cuteness of the barbaric spectacle. Branden Helger, 9, said Topsy was his favorite performer at Ringling Bros. because the elephant knew how to do neat tricks like pretending to limp. The third-grader also excitedly pointed out the ""cool necklace"" clamped on the animal's foot. Topsy and the other elephant performers, who are separated from each other at all times, preventing the socialization that's so crucial to their well-being, received a standing ovation from the crowd when they marched into the center ring, nervously rocking back and forth. ""Look, they're dancing,"" said 5-year-old Jonah Meeks, mistaking the elephants' constant swaying for something that wasn't a maladaptive behavior caused by serious psychological trauma. ""I can dance like an elephant, too. Look at me!"" Unaware that the elephant was terrified of the glaring stage lights, deafening crowd noise, and constant beatings, Phil Wingren, who brought his family to the circus, remarked that Topsy must relish being a star. ""Boy, that Topsy's got it made,"" Wingren said to his children, referring to the mistreated, severely neglected creature, who is exposed to numerous diseases and receives no medical attention except when dirt is rubbed into his wounds to hide them from the public. ""Always in the spotlight and everybody pampering you. That lucky elephant."" ""Look, he even has his own ball,"" continued Wingren, referring to the most hated object in Topsy's life. Attending the circus with her grandparents, Gretchen Anderson, 4, was delighted by Topsy and by the other pachyderms as well. ""There's his mama,"" Anderson said of an elephant unrelated to Topsy, who has not seen his parents since being torn away from them shortly after birth, and last nestled up to his mother when he tried to suckle at her corpse shortly after poachers killed her. ""They have a big happy family."" Eyewitnesses who spotted the trainer patting the side of Topsy's body during the final trick were convinced the elephant and the man were best friends, though in fact the look of reverie on Topsy's face was the result of his daydreaming about stomping and crushing the cruel asshole's head like an overripe melon.ii","entertainment, uncensored, news, vol 46 issue 22, entertainment"

2361,"New David Simon Project To Investigate Happy, Upper-Middle-Class Streets Of Wilmette, IL","NEW YORK'Speaking at an HBO press junket Monday, acclaimed writer-producer David Simon, creator of the gritty urban dramas The Wire and Treme, announced that his next project will be an epic, multilayered examination of the contented and comfortable streets of suburban Wilmette, IL. According to Simon, the sprawling new series, tentatively titled The Township, will offer a searing and unsentimental glimpse into the happy social fabric of modern-day Wilmette, an area known for its deeply untroubled history and well-functioning political structure. ""As a writer, my mission is to tell a story that makes viewers think about how conditions in American cities are created,"" Simon told reporters. ""We can't just turn our back on the staggering levels of happiness occurring in a place like Wilmette and say, 'Well, that's not my life.' We have to confront this tranquility head-on and shine a light on the institutions that are responsible for it."" Added Simon, ""I want this show to be an unflinching dissection of how the system has in no way failed the people of this town."" According to HBO sources, the novelistic series will chronicle the interconnected web of police officers, politicians, tradespeople, teachers, and ordinary families who are ""all complicit"" in perpetuating the cycle of institutional effectiveness that makes Wilmette the seventh best place in the country to raise children. Using these disparate strands, Simon hopes to weave a narrative of civil ease and affluence that extends all the way from Wilmette's happy schoolchildren to the competent, fairly elected trustees of its Village Board. ""Each episode will explore, in unsparing detail, many different facets of Wilmette,"" Simon said. ""One might begin by depicting the productive bureaucracy lurking behind the Wilmette PTA, and then suddenly shift its focus to the struggles of a Wilmette policewoman desperately trying to settle on the right color scheme for a new addition to her home."" ""It's a panorama,"" Simon continued. ""A panorama that asks, 'What are the inherent niceties that bind these characters together?'"" The Township will feature an ensemble cast, including actors Wendell Pierce and Dominic West from The Wire as a pair of successful, well-adjusted real estate agents who occasionally grab one quick drink after work before returning home to the families they love. Simon also confirmed that he had hired a number of his usual writing collaborators, including hard-edged urban-crime author Richard Price, to help realistically capture the pleasant, grammatically impeccable vernacular used on the nice streets of Wilmette. Real-life citizens of the town will also be cast in various small roles to lend the show an intense, you-are-there quality. ""It's crucial to the veracity of the series that we depict Wilmette as it really is, frills and all,"" said Simon, who claimed that shooting at the actual promenades and well-maintained public spaces of Wilmette will provide a powerful sense of authenticity. ""The tree-lined avenues, the manicured lawns, the quaint but state-of-the-art school buildings'we're going to take all these things, put them on the screen, and say, 'See? This, this, is the real Wilmette.'"" Simon concluded his announcement by stressing that, even under pressure from the network, he would not shy away from portraying some of the tougher elements of Wilmette life that take place each and every day. ""The truth is that some pretty unpleasant things happen in Wilmette,"" Simon said. ""Sometimes it rains. Sometimes a kid accidentally leaves his backpack at school. Our goal is to show how these problems develop."" Added Simon, ""And to show how they are quickly resolved, too.""","entertainment, news, vol 46 issue 19, entertainment"

2371,"Actress, Musician To Wed","HOLLYWOOD, CA'The actress from the big hit movie and the musician from the popular band who have been photographed many times together out on the town are getting married, entertainment industry sources reported Monday. ""I love him,"" the actress, who has been seen sporting a huge diamond engagement ring recently, told reporters while walking down the red carpet. ""He's definitely the one."" The wedding, which will take place this summer, is expected to be attended by many equally famous celebrities, and will be photographed by many paparazzi, via helicopter if necessary. Insiders expect the guest list to be a veritable 'who's who' of the rich and famous, including the Hollywood director, the reclusive former star who rarely makes public appearances, and the very handsome actor who used to be on television but is now in movies. According to sources, the wedding between the actress and the musician will be the most important social event of the season. ""It's going to take place on a tropical island owned by the couple's super-rich friend,"" said the blonde entertainment reporter. ""And her dress will be created by the fashion designer who did all those Oscar gowns."" ""Wow,"" she added. This will be the second marriage for both celebrities. The musician, who used to be married to the dancer before divorcing amid scandal over an Internet sexual intercourse tape, has recently attended sex addiction rehab and is described as ""ready to settle down"" by his lawyer, the famous bald one with the wife half his age. The actress, for her part, is doing her best to put her disastrous first marriage to the actor who does a lot of drugs all the time behind her. ""It's great to finally see her with a guy she deserves,"" said the actress's close friend and regular makeup artist. ""Especially after all the stuff that happened with you-know-who."" The actress, who almost got the role in the vampire film, and the musician, who recently collaborated with that other musician on the hit song of the summer, met at a gala event for the charity with the colored ribbons. They were later spotted together on the set of her movie about the secret agent who turns out to be an alien, to which the musician contributed several songs for the soundtrack. Described as ""love at first sight"" by sources, the pair's romance has nonetheless caused criticism from some entertainment industry media sources, who claim that the musician's bad-boy reputation could affect the actress's image, possibly jeopardizing her chance of being cast in the big sequel that's coming up. Some even said the marriage will never last. ""If I was that famous divorce lawyer, I'd be rubbing my hands together right now,"" said that gay Internet columnist who always trashes famous couples on his blog. Despite the naysayers, however, most are optimistic about the coupling. ""This is shaping up to be the wedding of the century,"" said the Hollywood gossip columnist in her regular Hollywood gossip column. ""One thing is for certain: Their kids are going to be both good-looking and very talented like their parents."" As is to be expected, the couple themselves have nothing but positive things to say about their upcoming nuptials. ""I've never felt this way before,"" the musician said in a recent issue of a very popular magazine. ""What can I say about a marriage like this? It is truly one of a kind.""","entertainment, celebrities, news, vol 46 issue 18, entertainment"

2384,FBI Uncovers Plot To 'Sex And The City 2',"WASHINGTON'Following an extensive eight month investigation, the FBI announced this week that it had learned of the potentially devastating plot to Sex And The City 2. Speaking at an emergency press conference Tuesday, FBI director Robert S. Mueller revealed details of the 'chilling' romantic-comedy plot, which he claimed could put millions of moviegoers at risk. 'We have strong reason to believe that on the morning of May 27, 2010, Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte, and Samantha will once again be unleashed on the American public,' Mueller said. 'While many details still remain unclear, including how large of a role Mr. Big will ultimately play, our intelligence indicates that countless men and women could soon be made to suffer.' 'The gals are back,' the FBI director continued. 'God help us all.' The terrifying plot, which is expected to last approximately two hours, and which appears capable of irritating on a scale never before witnessed, is being treated as a very serious threat by the FBI. According to federal operatives, unless preemptive measures are taken, Americans will likely face a barrage of highly orchestrated puns, overindulgent displays of fashion, and several rounds of Samantha droning on and on endlessly about her most recent sexual exploit. Even more troubling, however, is evidence indicating that Stanford Blatch'Carrie's insufferable gay friend and confidant'may be directly involved in the plot. 'We're placing the entire nation on high alert until we are able to confirm reports, but at this time, it does appear as though Miranda and perhaps Charlotte will be riding atop a camel in one scene,' said FBI deputy director John S. Pistole, shaking his head in disgust. 'Whatever the goal of thisfthis Sex And The City 2 may be, one thing is certain: This plot was devised for the sole purpose of spreading terror.' 'Terror and pain,' Pistole continued. 'Terror and pain and apparently a 15-minute brunch conversation pertaining to menopause.' According to agents, the FBI first heard rumors of the plot in August of last year, when Internet chatter picked up from People magazine's website was found to contain several red flags, including repeated mentions of 'the girls throwing on their high heels one last time.' By late October, operatives had uncovered a crude plot device, the details of which they would not reveal for fear of alarming an already-tense public. They also came across several script pages hinting that the fabulous foursome would be traveling to Abu Dhabi for a week of decadence, glamour, and no-limit fun. No action was taken at that time, however, because investigators believed the likelihood of anyone carrying out a plot based on such a flimsy premise was 'preposterous at best.' The FBI now admits it was wrong. 'For your safety, and the safety of those closest to you, we advise all Americans to stay indoors on May 27,' Mueller said. 'Women in their mid-30s, especially those with questionable tastes and few actual interests, should remain extra vigilant during this time.' Added Mueller, 'Their boyfriends, husbands, and fiancés are also believed to be at risk.' This isn't the first time the FBI has been criticized for failing to prevent a devastating Hollywood plot. In the summer of 1999, thousands of Americans wer","entertainment, terrorism, news, vol 46 issue 17, robert mueller, entertainment"

2389,Tom Hanks Forces Houseguests To Play 'World War II' With Him,"LOS ANGELES'Two-time Academy Award winner Tom Hanks, 53, once again invited a group of friends to his home and forced them to play a make-believe game of World War II with him, sources reported Saturday. Director and producer Ron Howard, one of the guests, confirmed that Hanks made his visitors pretend they were a battalion of Allied soldiers for more than six hours. 'We were told to come over for a late brunch, but as soon as he answered the door in his tanker helmet, I knew we'd be playing World War II with him again,' said Howard, adding that he realized he was in for the full treatment when he glimpsed Martin Short and Bruce Springsteen standing at attention in the foyer. 'I suggested maybe having some coffee or a muffin first, but he stared at me and said that I was a private and should just follow orders.' According to sources, Hanks barked out pretend mission objectives to his friends before issuing uniforms and M1 Garand rifle replicas to Springsteen and Short. Due to a 'recent attack on supply lines,' Howard was given a green sweat suit and a tennis racket meant to be held backward like a gun. 'Bruce, you're the tough guy from Brooklyn who cares a lot more than he lets on and everybody calls you 'Brooklyn,'' Hanks reportedly said, pacing back and forth in an authentic 1943 U.S. officer's field jacket. 'Martin, you're the funny medic named Dankowitz.' 'Ron, you'll be the weakling Irish kid everybody thinks is going to get us killed,' Hanks added. 'Let's just hope you don't, soldier.' Sources close to Hanks said the world's No. 1 box-office star regularly forces family, friends, and delivery people to pretend they're fighting World War II with him. Though he has been seen splashing in his pool on an inflatable lounger while shouting about kamikaze attacks, past houseguests confirmed Hanks' favorite thing is playing Western Front. On Saturday, Springsteen, a 20-time Grammy winner who has sold more than 120 million albums worldwide, acknowledged that Hanks was highly critical of his performance during the afternoon's World War II game. 'Right away he starts yelling at me that I'm standing in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean and I'm going to drown,' Springsteen said. 'When I told him I was wearing scuba gear he went ballistic, screaming that I'm an infantryman and I wouldn't have that kind of equipment.' Hanks was also seen pointing at two chairs covered by a blanket and ordering Howard, Springsteen, and Short to 'hit the barracks so you can write your gals back home and still get some shut-eye.' He then encouraged them to make snoring sounds to simulate sleep, and several minutes later hummed reveille through a closed hand he said was a bugle. 'Hey, Ron, you just wandered into Germany,' Hanks said. 'BAM! They shot you and now you're dead. You gotta lay down.' Next-door neighbor Stan Herzig, who was 'drafted' last month when Hanks told him Uncle Sam needed an elite paratrooper to join Alfred Molina and Julia Roberts on a special mission behind enemy lines, said he would prefer the actor find a different game to play. 'Whenever I go get the mail, he runs out and tells me I have to wait until the naval blockade is lifted,' said Herzig, 83. 'And I'm getting tired of explaining to him that the Soviets liberated Auschwitz, not the Americans.' Short told reporters that Saturday's invasion of Normandy was called off when Rita Wilson, Hanks' wife, kicked the group out of the house, claiming everyone was making a mess and it was too nice a day to be inside. Though Short said that Hanks 'always has to win, even when he's playing Germany,' he admitted the afternoon could have been worse. Said Short, 'At least this time I didn't get stuck being the mission control guy in his stupid moon man game.'","entertainment, tv, tom hanks, war, news, vol 46 issue 16, entertainment"

2407,New Six Flags Ride Based On Relationship With Deborah,"VALENCIA, CA'Promoting the coaster as 'the most heartbreaking ride on earth,' the Six Flags Magic Mountain theme park unveiled its newest attraction this week: a 395-foot-tall steel roller coaster designed to simulate a grueling three year relationship with Deborah. Developed by world-renowned and recently single engineer Phillip Werner, the Life Force Crusher-X is said to feature six disorienting vertical loops, 150-feet of highly unstable barrel rolls, a portion in the middle where the ride just suddenly stops for no reason and refuses to start again until riders apologize, and an unexpected 310-foot drop at the very end. 'This heart-racing, gut-wrenching 90 mph free fall into unhealthy codependence and trust issues will have even the most extreme thrill-seekers begging for it to be over,' reads a Six Flags press release announcing the new coaster, which promises to require more attention and patience than any one man should reasonably be expected to have. 'Can you survive the Agonizing Vortex of Unflagging Acrimony?' According to park officials, the coaster begins with an impulsive burst of acceleration that, when riders reflect upon the experience years later, will prove to be the only enjoyable portion of the ride. A series of unexpected and painful twists rapidly follow, leaving riders confused, strangely resentful, and wondering if they made a huge mistake getting on the ride in the first place. For the next 25 minutes, the coaster creeps endlessly forward at an agonizing pace, until it actually starts moving backward. When the Life Force Crusher-X mercifully comes to an end, park visitors often find themselves speechless, emotionally exhausted, and completely broke. 'What the fuck just happened?' roller coaster enthusiast Derek Schumer said. 'At first things were great, but next thing I knew, I was throwing my hands in the air and screaming, ''Why are we even doing this? I don't understand why we're doing this! It doesn't make either of us the least bit happy. Just end it, already, just end it!' Added Schumer, 'I think I'm going to be sick.' Despite only opening last week, Life Force Crusher-X is already one of Magic Mountain's main attractions. The park has even been forced to extend its hours to accommodate ticket holders who said they would never come back, only to find themselves pounding on the gates at 2 a.m., desperate for just one more go-round. 'I can't decide if I hate the ride or hate myself for going on it,' read one comment on a website that reviews roller coasters. 'At one point I glanced over at the people on other coasters, and they all looked so much happier.' 'I don't know,' the comment continued. 'Maybe the Life Force Crusher-X is just the type of coaster I deserve.' Park-goer Andrew Murray had a similar experience on the Six Flags ride. 'Pretty early on, I realized that I just needed to get off,' Murray said. 'But by that point we had just passed through the Tunnel of Pregnancy Scares, and there was no way I could up and leave then. God, to think of all the other rides I could have tried if I weren't trapped on that suffocating machine.' Although some have expressed safety concerns with the coaster's structure'more than 7,000 feet of steel tubular track hastily built on a foundation of lust and shared contempt-'both Six Flags and the designer himself have assured riders that the Life Force Crusher-X is nowhere near as dangerous as actually dating Deborah. 'Every inch of my coaster has been biodynamically analyzed by computers to be 100 percent safe, which is far more protection than I ever got from that heart-swallowing banshee of a woman,' designer Werner said at the unveiling of his semi-autobiographical ride. 'In fact, I myself ride the Crusher every morning. Just to remember.' Six Flags officials said they've already begun construction on their next coaster, one they are calling 'even more terrifying than being in a relationship with Deborah.' It's scheduled to open in 2012 and will be based on not being in a relationship with Deborah.","entertainment, amusement parks, news, vol 46 issue 15, entertainment"

2463,Scrappy Crew Of 'Good Morning America' Decides To Put On A News Show,"NEW YORK'Saying they were bored and there was nothing fun to do in the ABC studios, the spunky crew of Good Morning America announced ""really big plans"" Thursday to write and broadcast their very own television news show all by themselves. The cute little program, which will be produced without any help from any grown-ups, and which will feature important news, interviews with funny people, and also weather, will air Friday at 7 a.m. ""We're gonna write our own scripts and read from 'em and tell everyone in the whole world about stuff that's happening,"" said George Stephanopoulos, who led the plucky band of lovable scamps and had everybody line up to try their best newscaster voice. ""I'm gonna talk about the president."" Added Stephanopoulous, ""You'll see. We'll be just like a real news show."" According to ABC sources, the scrappy Good Morning America crew has already begun preparing for their big morning news show, with Robin Roberts organizing the group of happy-go-lucky rascals into teams and ordering them to borrow fancy suits from their parents and gather up as much news as they could find. Juju Chang was reportedly placed in charge of making sure the boy anchors combed their hair nicely to the side. ""This is going to be so much fun!"" said Sam Champion, 48, who looked just like a little man in his blue grown-up suit and told reporters that he would be interviewing zookeeper Jack Hanna on the show. ""I already have all of my questions ready, like five thousand hundred of them, and they said I could use a microphone when I talk about all the different animals."" ""But I have to be careful, also, when I pet the little baby koalas,"" Champion added. ""They're delicate!"" While certain segments have already been confirmed'including the Hanna interview and a weather piece in which Chang will talk about the clouds and sun and point to pictures of the clouds and the sun, much of the two-hour broadcast has yet to be determined. According to sources, Stephanopoulos has decided to fill some of that time by having Robin Roberts file a report on a suicide- bombing attack that killed 23 in Pakistan this month, but told her not to worry if she did not understand what it was about, stressing that it was more important for her to make a sad face when talking about it. ""I'm going to do a good job and talk about very important news events for probably over a whole minute,"" Roberts said. ""I'll also say the words nice and clear so people can understand me, and I'm not going to giggle even once, I swear."" With only minutes to showtime and Sam Champion needing to use the bathroom, many at ABC remained skeptical that the plucky band of ne'er-do-wells has what it takes to make their broadcast work. Still, some are pulling for them. ""They might not be the most capable or the most informed, but I'll be darned if they aren't adorable trying so hard,"" ABC News president David Westin said. ""Robin and George especially were just as cute as a button when they came marching into my office with all of their grown-up ideas. They seemed so excited about putting on a real news show."" Executive producer Tom Cibrowski agreed. ""It was absolutely precious how they wanted to do a piece about the Haitian earthquake right before a segment on low-fat additions to ice cream sundaes,"" Cibrowski said. ""If anyone else tried that it would probably come off as insulting or in poor taste, but you can't get mad at these little guys. They don't even know what they're doing up there."" ""Everyone should make sure and tell them they did a good job,"" Cibrowski continued. ""And that they should be proud of themselves.""

2497,'CSI' Set To Perform At Super Bowl Halftime Show,"MIAMI'Just three weeks before its highly anticipated on-field performance at the Super Bowl XLIV halftime show, the popular CBS crime drama CSI is gearing up for what network executives are promising will be a ""thrilling, high-tech whodunit on fourth and inches."" According to CBS sources, the hour-long live performance on the Dolphin Stadium 50-yard line will feature the CSI cast and crew moving briskly through a tightly plotted narrative involving the investigation of several grisly murders in the greater Las Vegas area. ""Every performer dreams of playing the Super Bowl halftime show, so I can't begin to tell you how excited we are,"" CSI creator/producer Anthony Zuiker said. ""When you look at the legends who've played it in the past'from Prince to Michael Jackson to Bruce Springsteen'it's incredible to think that CSI will soon be able to give screaming football fans a great show packed with all the taut, forensics-based intrigue they crave."" Added Zuiker, ""And I don't want to give away too much, but let's just say things might get a little sticky for Sanders down in the lab."" An estimated $20 million has already been spent on the CSI halftime show, with much of the budget reportedly going toward the opening set piece, in which cast members Laurence Fishburne and Liz Vassey enter the stands to examine a young child's decomposing corpse in the fourth row. While details of the show are a closely guarded secret, inside sources maintained that football fans would be treated to the same exciting twists and turns they have come to expect from the hit CBS drama, including the discovery of a semen stain just feet from the goal line that will leave viewers ""on the edge of their seats."" ""Obviously, the format presents some technical challenges for us,"" said CBS Super Bowl producer Lance Barrow. ""This particular episode of CSI involves about 19 different locations, so it's going to take some effort, for instance, to transition smoothly between the victim's mother's dining room and the central booking station. But that's what the giant revolving set in the middle of the field is for."" Added Barrow, ""The driving scenes might also be a little tricky, but we'll have a team of extras dressed as cops out there who will help clear a path in the crowd to make way for the cars."" Dolphin Stadium officials confirmed that they had hired extra grounds crew for what will likely be a heavy clean-up task. At least two dozen workers will be in charge of managing a 40-foot-long replica of a character's pancreas, which will spill simulated blood and digestive enzymes all over the field when punctured with a 30-foot-long scalpel prop. CBS sources also revealed that CSI's performance would be interspersed with a number of showstopping live advertisements, including promos for upcoming episodes of other CBS series'among them Numb3rs and The Big Bang Theory'performed onstage by the casts of those shows. While some have wondered whether the tense, hour-long narrative played out live in the middle of Super Bowl Sunday might take away from the actual football game, the network is assuring pigskin fans that they will not be disappointed. ""We're pulling out all the stops,"" CBS president and CEO Les Moonves said. ""Tons of impenetrable forensic jargon; a graphic, four-minute conversation about a victim's rectal cavity; plus a special guest appearance from a certain former Nash Bridges star."" Added Moonves, ""Now, if that doesn't say 'Super Bowl XLIV,' then I don't know what does.""","entertainment, super bowl, news, vol 46 issue 03, entertainment"

2509,"Clint Eastwood Continues Desperate, 40-Year Attempt To Win Over Unimpressed Man","LOS ANGELES' Five-time Academy Award winner and Hollywood legend Clint Eastwood attended a press junket Tuesday to promote his new film Invictus, the latest project in the director's long line of failed attempts to impress Wheeling, WV resident Daryl Lorrimer. According to Eastwood, gaining the 53-year-old repair technician's approval has been the sole motivating factor for most of his famed career, dictating everything from the scripts he chooses to a film's wardrobe selection. ""Nothing I do is ever good enough for Daryl,"" the exasperated cinema icon told reporters. ""I mean, why can't Daryl once'just once'say that he enjoyed a movie of mine? Would it kill him to say that?"" ""He's got to like this new one,"" Eastwood continued. ""Jesus Christ, he's just got to."" The 79-year-old Gran Torino star claimed that he has failed time and again to make Lorrimer appreciate his work. Eastwood stopped appearing in Spaghetti Westerns when Lorrimer passed on a chance to see the ""Dollars"" trilogy at Wheeling's Evergreen Drive-In in 1969, and in the 1970s Eastwood made the move to the director's chair only to show the unimpressed husband and father of four that he has talent behind the camera. In 2006, a desperate Eastwood released two separate films about the Battle of Iwo Jima on the off-chance that Lorrimer, who once enjoyed a TV documentary on the subject, might find them interesting. Eastwood even composed the score to one of the films specifically to impress him, though Lorrimer ""didn't even notice."" ""Daryl really likes sports movies, so my gut tells me that Invictus has a good shot,"" the legendary director said. ""I worked really hard on it. Then again, I worked really hard on Million Dollar Baby, too, and Daryl fell asleep right before Hilary Swank's character got paralyzed."" ""I don't get it, because [Lorrimer's wife] Jan loved it,"" Eastwood added. ""I just don't get it."" Eastwood claimed that he has purposefully sought out wildly divergent roles and projects in hopes of somehow wowing Lorrimer, at one point adopting a tough-guy cop image in the Dirty Harry films just to pique Lorrimer's interest. But Lorrimer was reportedly ""never a big fan"" of the Dirty Harry series, having a stronger preference for Charles Bronson's Death Wish films. ""So then I took a gamble and lost on those stupid orangutan movies because I thought maybe he'd want to see me in a comedy,"" Eastwood said. ""Or maybe he'd like a movie with monkeys in it or something, I don't know. I mean, who the hell knows with this guy anymore? I've been busting my balls for the past 40 years, and I'm running out of options."" Those close to Eastwood claim that the actor-director has spent the last few decades pursuing ""total shot-in-the-dark"" projects like Space Cowboys and The Bridges Of Madison County, all of which have failed to strike any chord with Lorrimer whatsoever. ""He's obsessed,"" Eastwood's longtime agent Mark Stafford said. ""Whenever we discuss a possible new film, he paces around saying, 'What would Daryl think?' 'Would Daryl like this?' 'What about Daryl?' The only reason Pink Cadillac was even made was because Daryl had been thinking about buying a used Cadillac."" Despite his frustration, Eastwood has vowed to continue making films, telling reporters he won't retire until he wins Lorrimer's admiration. Meanwhile, he's still holding out hope for Invictus, which Lorimer saw Wednesday. ""Matt Damon was pretty good,"" said Lorrimer, emerging from a 7:10 screening of the film. ""The movie was a little long, though.""","entertainment, celebrities, movies, news, vol 46 issue 01, entertainment"

""While human beings had experimented with rudimentary forms of shimmying and gyration as early as the Neanderthal period, it was not until they were able to reach critical levels of utter inebriation that early cultures finally began to let their hair down and really cut loose,"" said Yu Wei Lin of the Beijing Institute of Dance Studies. ""In fact, we now believe that alcohol-fueled revelry paralleled and probably influenced the practice of the ill-advised hookup, the rambling apology for the previous night's behavior, and poetry."" Lin also said that exciting new evidence indicates that a prehistoric ""Electric Slide"" was practiced in Tibet millennia before the invention of electricity.","entertainment, year in review 2009, news in brief, vol 45 issue 51, entertainment"

2518,Four Or Five Guys Pretty Much Carry Whole Renaissance,"Following 1,000 years of cultural decline and societal collapse known as the Dark Ages, the 15th century brought forth the Renaissance, an unprecedented resurgence in learning and the arts, which four or five guys pretty much just strapped onto their backs and carried the whole way. ""Our research indicates that da Vinci, Michelangelo, Shakespeare, and Galileo basically hoisted the entire intellectual transformation of mankind onto their shoulders while everyone else just sat around being superstitious nimrods,"" said Sue Viero of the Correr Museum of Art in Venice, Italy. ""Here's da Vinci busting his ass to paint such masterpieces as The Last Supper and the Mona Lisa, while some loser like Albrecht Dürer is doing these dinky little woodcuts that are basically worthless."" ""And how pathetic is it that Masaccio wasted so much time churning out his frescoes that barely revolutionized linear perspective or naturalism at all, when without Michelangelo's David, we wouldn't even have a Renaissance to begin with?"" Viero added. ""Honestly, it's not even friggin' close."" According to modern thought on the era, contributors to the Renaissance can be broken into two distinct groups: the brilliant few who, day in and day out, were thrusting society out of the depths of darkness and into the light of learning; and the rest of the so-called artists, mathematicians, and scientists, who were mostly all phoning it in. Among those considered by historians not to have pulled their weight are Sandro Botticelli, Hugo van der Goes, Titian, and Italian humanist and total hanger-on Pico della Mirandola. ""So, Pico's most famous philosophical work was Oration On The Dignity Of Man,"" scoffed Harvard philosophy professor Richard Nostrand. ""I mean, come on. Compare that to Thomas More's Utopia for'actually, you know what? Don't bother. Because you can't."" While some claim the three- century-long movement would not have been possible without the contributions of lesser-known sculptors and thinkers, most scholars said they would challenge anyone to name an image by Jan van Eyck or Francesco Guicciardini that's more iconic than, say, Donatello's Mary Magdalene. ""It's a no-brainer, really,"" cultural anthropologist Diane Messinick said. ""Mediocre talents like the playwright George Peele or renowned court painter Federico Brandani were pretty much the equivalent of the guy at work who brews a fresh pot of coffee while you're busy making sure there's still a company to come back to after everyone gets back from goddamn Christmas break."" Added Messinick, ""Hacks.""","entertainment, year in review 2009, news, vol 45 issue 51, entertainment"

'He flailed around like some kind of caveman for something to say about the Kanye West incident, and then tried to steer the conversation toward the health care debate. I would have pitied the man were he not so unapologetically obtuse.' Sources reported that the unlearned Merriam almost redeemed his intellectual credentials by knowing the name of one of the contestants on Top Chef.","entertainment, taylor swift, music, culture, news in brief, vol 45 issue 50, entertainment"

""To remain silent about the abhorrent methods used to interrogate alleged enemy combatants would be a betrayal of the ideals we hold most dear,"" said New Yorker music critic Sasha Frere-Jones, a spokesperson for the loose coalition of music snobs. ""I mean, 'Enter Sandman,' from Metallica's 1991 self-titled album? Really? Not to say there isn't some classic stuff on the torture playlist, but even my 12-year-old nephew would choose something a little more unexpected than Nine Inch Nails to shatter an utterly demoralized man's already tenuous grip on reality."" ""They could have at least picked an excerpt from Dream Theater's A Change Of Seasons EP to play at 120 decibels for 14 hours a day,"" Frere-Jones continued. ""If I were handcuffed to a chair with something as tired as Tupac's 'Keep Ya Head Up' blasting in my face, I'd probably pass out from boredom, despite the painful sleep deprivation stress positions."" In addition to deriding the CIA's song choices, protesters attacked the playlist's lack of variety, saying the music selected to abuse prisoners fell mostly within the categories of heavy metal and contemporary Top 40 pop. Rolling Stone senior editor David Fricke said the overall effect of the nonstop, unbearably loud music would have greatly benefited from delving into some of the subtler rock styles. ""What those poor people have had to suffer through is a shameful travesty,"" Fricke said. ""Can you imagine being forced to listen to Deicide and Drowning Pool all day long? Yes, the metal genre has a lot to offer, but why not broaden your palette a bit by throwing on something from Minutemen's Double Nickels On The Dime or even Roxy Music's Avalon after a few of the heavier tracks?"" Added Fricke, ""If the prisoner still had any idea who he was at that point, anything from those albums would totally blow his mind."" Last month, ""Dean of American Rock Critics"" Robert Christgau wrote a letter to the CIA offering to assist the agency in producing more sophisticated compilations for the systematic dehumanization of detainees, but he has reportedly not yet received a response. Though the activists all agreed that the musical tastes reflected in the state-sanctioned torture were laughable, the group was split along ideological lines into numerous factions. While many argued for the use of deep cuts from the Rolling Stones' 1972 double record Exile On Main St. to deafen prisoners and reduce them to whimpering children, others demanded that the infliction of irreparable psychological damage incorporate tracks by more esoteric modern artists like Simian Mobile Disco and the Black Lips. A small but especially vocal contingent tirelessly lobbied for the inclusion of at least one selection from Steely Dan's 1977 tour de force Aja, preferably the song ""Peg."" ""Blatantly dismissing what the U.S. government has done to these men is an unconscionable miscarriage of justice,"" Pitchfork.com contributor Andy Ragazzo said. ""I've been here for nearly six hours, and I haven't heard one person other than myself so much as mention the groundbreaking work of minimal techno and microhouse artist Ricardo Villalobos."" ""It almost makes me ashamed to be an American,"" Ragazzo added.","entertainment, music, mental health, prison, news, vol 45 issue 47, entertainment"

2558,U.S. Deports Lou Dobbs,"WANTAGE, NJ'Acting on anonymous tips from within the Hispanic-American community, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials on Wednesday deported Luis Miguel Salvador Aguila Dominguez, who for the last 48 years had been living illegally in the United States under the name Lou Dobbs. According to the Department of Homeland Security, federal agents stormed the undocumented immigrant's home in an evening raid just hours after the 64-year-old newscaster suddenly announced that he was resigning from CNN, and immediately placed him on an Aeromexico flight departing from Newark Liberty Airport. ""Mr. Dominguez did not come quietly, but in the end he came,"" said Sam Whitlock of the U.S. Border Patrol, who was injured during the arrest. ""He pulled a knife on me, like they will, and swore a bunch in Spanish and spit on us when we finally managed to grab him by the serape and throw him against a wall. But the important thing is that he's now back where he belongs."" Evidence collected by investigators indicates that Dominguez/Dobbs, who has long claimed Texas heritage, was actually born in the Mexican state of Puebla to parents of Colombian descent, neither of whom were U.S. citizens. In the summer of his 16th year, he and 14 of his brothers and sisters paid smugglers to let them ride atop packages of cocaine in the cargo hold of a fishing boat bound for Texas under cover of night. In addition to holding multiple jobs without ever obtaining a guest-worker permit or H-1B visa, ""Dobbs"" is reported to have collected welfare every month for nearly five decades. He appeared in good health when apprehended, having used Medicaid to obtain numerous health care services over the years, but immigration officials fear he still may have exposed the American population to the many infectious diseases illegal immigrants tend to carry, including both malaria and leprosy. CNN, as per its policy initiated by Dominguez, is complying freely with the ongoing DHS investigation into the multitude of illegal activities in which its former employee was entrenched. ""No one here knew anything about Mr. Dobbs' past, and to be honest, we never asked,"" said a source within CNN, who asked not to be identified. ""All we knew was that he was willing to take the job most American newscasters didn't want'namely, speaking out hysterically against immigration at every turn to help us gain ratings points against Fox News."" After arriving in Texas in 1961, ""Dobbs"" is believed to have wandered around the American southeast making a meager living as a car thief, low-level drug dealer, and migrant farm laborer. At age 18, he reportedly delivered an ounce of marijuana to attendees at an Atlanta media conference, where his harsh, booming voice and fiery temper caught the attention of none other than Ted Turner. At the tycoon's urging, the young man shaved his long, drooping mustachios, applied for federal tuition waivers, and took advantage of affirmative-action policies to gain admittance to Harvard University. In 1980, Turner gave him a job at CNN that had previously been held by an American-born reporter. When searching the former newscaster's house in Wantage, NJ, Border Patrol agents found several boxes of horded food stamps, a fully-equipped stolen-car chop shop, a 350-deck DVD pirating warehouse, and a garment facility where up to 100 illegal workers put in 85-hour weeks producing knockoff purses, shoes, and other counterfeit clothing. Many younger members of the Border Patrol team that participated in Wednesday's raid said it was ""an honor and a privilege"" to help deport Dominguez, as years of listening to tirades against illegal immigrants on Lou Dobbs Tonight had been a major factor in their choice of career. ""This is a battle for the soul of our country,"" Agent Jared Burns, 23, said as he helped the 17 Dominguez children board the bus that would take them to a detention facility where their legal status will eventually be determined. ""Today is a proud day for any true American."" Immediately before press time, ""Dobbs"" arrived in Mexico City, and was surrounded by members of the international press. ""¡Esos hijos de puta sufrirán por esto!"" a handcuffed Dominguez shouted at reporters from the tarmac. ""Sin mi vigilancia, mis hermanos y yo nos apresuraríamos a la frontera a robar sus carros y a violar sus mujeres. ¡Arriba!""","entertainment, celebrities, tv, immigration, news, vol 45 issue 47, entertainment"

""We're just so proud of Brian and everything he's failed to accomplish in his largely sedentary and insipid life,"" said ABC president Stephen McPherson, whose network was there to receive the Chicago-area infant the day he came home from the hospital. ""Sure, we did our best to try and instill in Brian our own lack of values, and we always hoped he'd follow the trivial lessons imparted by our programming, but with children, you never really know how they're going to end up until you see it for yourself."" ""Just look at him sitting there with absolutely nothing on his mind,"" McPherson continued. ""He's our pride and joy."" Jo Ann Smith, board member of the frozen meals conglomerate Tyson Foods, said she was equally delighted with the dangerously obese young man her company helped raise. According to the wistful executive, she still remembers the first time her ""little darling Brian,"" then only 13 months old, took his first steps toward a plate of deep fried chicken strips, completely ignoring a bowl of fresh fruit as he toddled by. ""I always knew Brian was going to be something special,"" said Smith, adding that she nearly cried the first time she heard Madsen say her company's name out loud. ""We just had this amazing bond right from the start. Whether he was upset about something that happened at school, angry about being rejected by his peers, or just feeling depressed in general, Brian knew he could always turn to Tyson Foods to comfort him."" Noting how willingly Madsen accepted their guidance, and how much he truly loved them both, the nation's television and processed food producers stated that it had been ""magical"" watching the small child blossom into a 241-pound adult. Fox TV executive Mike Darnell told reporters that it didn't seem so long ago that a frightened and confused Madsen turned to his television set late one night with questions about sex, and an episode of Baywatch was there to answer them all. ""It's little things like that you remember most,"" said Darnell, whose network also taught Madsen ""everything he knows"" about disconnecting from reality and staring slack-jawed out into space. ""Just knowing that I played a small part in helping to emotionally and intellectually stunt another life'there's really nothing better in the world."" Irene Rosenfeld, CEO of Kraft Foods, agreed. ""There's just so many great memories,"" Rosenfeld said. ""The time Brian spent all afternoon eating Easy Mac when he could have been out hitting his first Little League home run, the family-size bag of marshmallows he slowly devoured while the rest of his graduating class attended prom. I'll treasure them all."" A number of television and processed food executives admitted that they worried about the growing child from time to time. According to CBS brass, Madsen went through an unusual phase during high school when he began to think and act for himself, a development they found shocking. In addition, Coca-Cola executives said they would never ""in a million years"" forget the scare they received one morning when Madsen briefly expressed interest in joining a nearby YMCA. Nevertheless, sources said, Madsen could not have turned out any better. ""To see him all grown-up and ready to face the world is incredibly exciting,"" said Craig Johnson, president of Philip Morris USA, whose company stepped in and helped the shy and directionless boy to become a man. ""Call me biased, but I have a feeling we're going to hear a lot from Brian in the next decade or two he has left.""","entertainment, food, tv, cooking, fast food, news, vol 45 issue 43, entertainment"

2594,Vince Vaughn Appears On 'Tonight Show' To Deceive Country About Latest Film,"HOLLYWOOD, CA'Popular film actor Vince Vaughn appeared on NBC's Tonight Show Monday to brazenly and unapologetically deceive the American people about his latest movie, Couples Retreat. ""It's a really funny movie, and I think people are going to enjoy it,"" lied the 39-year-old performer, knowing full well that he was misleading viewers into making a decision that was not in their best interests. ""It's got something for everybody."" Added Vaughn, in another willful distortion of the truth, ""It's got a really fun vibe."" Sources reported that Vaughn's Tonight Show appearance was merely the latest stop on a campaign of deception currently being waged by the tall and dishonest funnyman across various media outlets. In the past week alone, Vaughn has appeared on three separate television programs and two syndicated radio programs, offering duplicitous information about Couples Retreat with no outward indication of remorse. ""This was the director's first movie, and he did a fantastic job,"" Vaughn said during Monday's broadcast, ensnaring filmmaker Peter Billingsley into his tangled web of deceit. ""It was a real pleasure working with him. He's a terrific guy."" Aiding Vaughn in his deliberate exploitation of Americans' inherently trusting natures was Tonight Show host Conan O'Brien, who referred to a 22-second clip from the film as ""very funny stuff."" O'Brien then further established himself as an untrustworthy television personality by looking directly into the camera and fraudulently assuring viewers that there would be ""so much more to talk about"" after the commercial break. Vaughn and O'Brien, however, are only two of several thousand performers currently engaged in elaborately deceptive schemes designed to trick the TV-viewing public. Known for their striking good looks and charming personalities, these men and women will reportedly do anything in their power to hoodwink average citizens into watching their latest romantic comedy, network prime-time show, or low-budget made-for-TV movie. ""Why is Vince Vaughn doing this?"" asked Baltimore housewife Beth Delbanco, 46. ""Time and again, from Fred Claus to Four Christmases, this man has gone on TV and told me to my face, 'Go see this movie, you will enjoy it.' He's stealing my money!"" Added Delbanco, ""I thought I could trust these celebrities."" Sources reported that Vaughn's Tonight Show appearance was the most blatant act of televised dishonesty since Sept. 29, when, during an appearance on The Late Late Show With Craig Ferguson, actor Jude Law claimed that it was ""good to be here.""","entertainment, celebrities, movies, tv, featured section: lies, news, vol 45 issue 42, entertainment"

2608,Struggling Museum Now Allowing Patrons To Touch Paintings,"NEW YORK'Hoping to boost attendance and broaden its base of supporters, the Metropolitan Museum of Art launched a new initiative this week that allows patrons, for the first time ever, to prod and scratch at the classic paintings in its revered collection. ""Though it contains more than two million pieces and represents a profound legacy of artistic achievement, most people remain completely indifferent to our museum,"" Met director Thomas P. Campbell said. ""So we decided to try something a little different and give visitors a chance to experience our timeless works of art up close and personal."" Added Campbell, ""Please, bring the whole family and smudge up our paintings as much as you want."" According to Campbell, attendance has increased tenfold since the new policy went into effect, with record turnouts causing 45-minute waits for those wishing to clumsily paw at the works of Vincent van Gogh. ""You can't grasp the brilliance of a great painting just by looking at it,"" said Phil Brehm, 32, who acknowledged that he hadn't set foot inside a museum since a mandatory field trip in high school. ""To truly appreciate fine art, you need to be able to run your fingers over its surface and explore its range of textures."" ""Or just rub your face all over it, like I do,"" Brehm added. Gerard Schmidt, a retired banker who lives near the Met, said he had never much cared for museums until he was given the chance to manhandle one of Monet's Water Lilies. ""At first it just looked like a picture of a bunch of lily pads, but then I started scraping at it with my pocket knife and the whole painting just sort of spoke to me,"" Schmidt said. ""For the first time, I finally understand what Monet was trying to get across in her work."" Art students also took advantage of the Met's relaxed rules, with many photocopying Cézanne canvasses or trying to gain insight into Rembrandt's techniques by tracing over Aristotle With A Bust Of Homer with soft pencils and charcoal. Karen Cooper, a 41-year-old mother of four, said she enjoyed her first visit to the Met, but admitted it was exhausting to spend an entire afternoon touching paintings. ""This is good to know about, though"" said Cooper, before applying another coating of moisturizing lotion to her hands and returning to palm more Vermeers. ""Whenever I need some alone time, I can bring the kids here and send them off to go play with the Picassos for a while."" Museum officials confirmed that many new visitors have given donations to the museum to get special member benefits, such as being allowed to remove works of art from the walls and sit down with them while enjoying food or drinks in the café. The new policy has been so popular that on Monday the Met began extending tactile privileges beyond its paintings. Patrons are now invited to climb inside ancient Egyptian sarcophagi, whether to take a souvenir photo or just carve a message into a 2,500-year-old sacred coffin. Museum-goers are also encouraged to try on the medieval suits of armor and participate in mock battles. Commenting on the diversity of the museum's permanent collection, Met publicity director Sarita Bhakta said, ""Where else can you recline in an original Mies chair, put your feet up on a Rodin, and play ""The Devil Went Down To Georgia"" on a 300-year-old Stradivarius?"" Some, however, remained unimpressed. ""I touched a crapload of Jasper Johns' paintings,"" said Mark Bennet, 67. ""I just don't get why they're supposed to be so special. They feel like any regular old painting."" Still, the Met's success has inspired other institutions to follow suit. The Guggenheim Museum now allows customers to swing from its Calder mobiles, while the American Museum of Natural History has begun charging $2 to ride atop its famed brontosaurus skeleton. And the cash-strapped Boston Symphony Orchestra has created a special ""Jam Night"" during which audience members can come up onstage to play along with the orchestra, improvise lyrics, or just twirl around waving colored scarves. ""Sometimes you have to go that extra mile to grab people's attention,"" said Campbell, the Met director. ""Sometimes it takes more than curating exhibits that bring meaning and context to our complex cultural heritage, more than preserving works of art that capture the spirit of transcendence unique to humankind."" Continued Campbell: ""Next year we're going to let people grab any masterpiece they like and just take a shit on it.""","entertainment, art, news, vol 45 issue 41, entertainment"

2612,Nation Demands Fresh Celebrity Meat,"HOLLYWOOD, CA'Like famished dogs salivating before a warm and steaming carcass, a coalition of bloodthirsty Americans demanded this week that the entertainment industry provide them with newer, fresher celebrities to mercilessly devour. ""Our most sumptuous celebrities have been picked to the bone,"" a statement by the group, Citizens for Renewed Celebrity Consumption, read in part. ""We can no longer subsist vicariously on the travails and public deteriorations of Lindsay Lohan and Britney Spears. These fetid idols are mere shreds of their former selves, and we, the American entertainment consumers, grow ever hungrier for a new crop of stars on which to feast."" ""We need meat!"" the statement continued. ""Raw, bloody meat!"" Calling Shia LaBeouf's substance abuse problems ""unsastifying,"" and the persistent tabloid coverage of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt ""a mere morsel, unfit even for a sewer rat,"" the CRCC claimed that the current batch of celebrities are simply not providing the level of self-immolation necessary to slake the rabid appetites of the American public. In an extensive outline of their demands, the CRCC called for the immediate coupling of 25 emotionally unstable stars, grainy nude photos of Megan Fox, and a new Disney channel devoted entirely to the creation of teenage singing sensations who can be lured into the debaucherous lifestyle of Los Angeles' most rich and famous. ""The nation very much enjoyed sinking its fangs into the flesh of Jon and Kate plus eight, but we gobbled them up much too quickly, and now require a second course,"" said CRCC spokeswoman Ellen Jameson, rhythmically sharpening two butcher knives against each other. ""Feed us. Feed us now or else."" Across the country, consumers echoed the CRCC's call for new celebrity fodder. At an impromptu rally outside a Chicago-area cinema Tuesday, hundreds of moviegoers waiting in line suddenly began chanting ""Meat! Meat! We demand fresh meat!"" before overturning several cars and Dumpsters. And in Miami, there were reports of fevered howling around the city last week following the season premier of Grey's Anatomy. Media experts have been warning for months that American consumers will face starvation if Hollywood does not provide someone for them to put on a pedestal, worship, envy, download sex tapes of, and then topple and completely destroy. Ideally, ravenous sources said, the new celebrity should be under the age of 6, so that he or she can be slowly and fully devoured, much like what has been called the ""perfect storm"" of celebrity self-destruction: the life of Michael Jackson. ""Forced into fame by an abusive father, robbed of his childhood by a greedy public, and then ascending to superstar status, acquiring huge sums of money and even greater debt, growing progressively more and more insane, getting indicted for child molestation, and eventually dying of a heart attack brought on by massive doses of half a dozen different prescription drugs, followed by a hypocritical backswing into near deification after his death, Michael Jackson was a most delicious and bountiful feast,"" Variety writer Janet Cosgrove said. ""But now Hollywood executives must throw us even more to eat or, God help us, we will turn on them and tear them apart instead!"" The industry has so far had no shortage of citizens willing to become the American public's next meal. ""Give me fame'I'm willing to do anything,"" said Los Angeles resident Jenna Sanders, an aspiring singer-actress. ""Dress me up in fancy gowns, parade every detail of my personal life before the world, objectify me, drive me to cocaine and lesbianism. I don't care about the consequences as long as I have my moment in the spotlight!"" ""Eat me!"" she shouted to reporters. ""Rip me limb from limb and eat me alive!""","entertainment, celebrities, movies, news, vol 45 issue 40, entertainment"

2627,I Was Dying Way Before Every Other Celebrity Started Doing It,"Look, I don't want to be one of those whiny famous dudes who spends his days ragging on other famous dudes in the press. That's not what I'm about. But this whole thing with celebrities dying has just become such a crock of shit, man. Such a crock of shit. I'm telling you, dying when you're incredibly famous has been done. By me. I was doing that shit 15 years ago, and now people are acting like it's some new trendy thing. Come on. I was tragically dying before my time way before all these other pop culture mainstays. I was burning out and not fading away back when they were all still living successful, healthy lives a thousand miles from death's door. Honestly, I cannot begin to tell you how fucking weak it is in this day and age for famous people to die like it's some sort of big accomplishment. What is this, 1994? Whatever happened to formulating your own ideas? Don't just die because I did it, man. Find your own thing. See, people don't think for themselves anymore, that's the problem. And why not? Because the corporations who control the media outlets in this country have taught you all to shut up and eat your bowl of slop like good little piggies. Well, fuck them, and fuck their slop. I never played that game. My death existed totally outside of the corporate structure for what famous people 'can' and 'can't' do. And then, a little more than a year after I die, Jerry Garcia drops dead because it's suddenly 'hip' to do so. Give me a fucking break, man. And that shit is still happening, to this day. I mean, if you're going to die famous'like, really fucking die'then at least do it with some originality, you know? Don't cop out with some cancer or cardiac arrest thing. That's not how I wanted to go out. No way. I did it myself, man. DIY style. I didn't need a whole bunch of doctors and fancy medical equipment and the comfort of assorted friends and family to pass away in a highly publicized manner. Fuck that. All I needed was a shotgun, some heroin, a couple of Valiums, and Automatic For The People spinning on the turntable. Simple. Perfect. Punk rock. Not that it wasn't watered down later by the media, of course. It's a shame, because my death was so much more pure and raw before those smiley-faced vanilla merchants tried to sugarcoat it and force it down your throats on MTV. And okay, fine, all famous people who die are inspired by the famous people who died before them, and no idea for dying is original, and all the rest of that tired crap. And of course I acknowledge the influence that the deaths of Sid Vicious, James Dean, Jimi Hendrix, and Dylan Thomas had on me. That's a given. But I worked really hard and paid my dues as an artist to get to the point where I could die in a maelstrom of tabloid scrutiny, and I didn't wait until I was fiftysomething years old to do it, either. No way, man. Twenty-seven years old. Just a crazy punk kid from Aberdeen, WA who made it happen. So if you're some young little fucker sitting in your parents' basement somewhere, listening to your Mudhoney records, jamming on your shitty little Sears-bought guitar, and dreaming of being a big, famous, dead person one day, let me give you a word of advice: Don't bother. Sure, getting famous and dying will bring you more attention than you could ever hope for and make your family tons of money. But trust me, it ain't worth it. Because one day, years later, some freakish R&B; clown, or grizzled old pinup girl, or well-respected newsman is going to kick the bucket and claim all the credit for what you started. And then your ass is nothing but a memory. So just forget about dying famous, kids. It's a sad truth, but one you've got to face: You'd be better off alive.","entertainment, celebrities, death, music, commentary, vol 45 issue 38, kurt cobain, entertainment"

2644,News Of Jenna Elfman Sitcom Sends Herd Of Buffalo Into Wild Stampede,"WYOMING'Hundreds of buffalo thundered across the Wyoming plains Thursday after news of actress Jenna Elfman's latest sitcom, Accidentally On Purpose, spooked the unsuspecting herbivores. Upon learning of the new CBS comedy about a single woman who finds herself pregnant after a one-night stand with a much younger guy, the buffalo charged en masse, responding as if by instinct alone. ""A stampede of this magnitude is extremely rare,"" said Howard Kremer, a specialist in herd-bound behavior who noted that this was one of the most destructive events of its kind he had ever seen. ""Only a large enough threat, such as an approaching pack of wolves, or a quirky prime-time vehicle built around the former costar of Dharma And Greg, could trigger it."" At press time, the frightened herd had run itself off a nearby cliff, so blind was its desire to escape the hijinks and hilarity airing Mondays this fall.","entertainment, celebrities, tv, news in brief, vol 45 issue 36, entertainment"

""These songs are awful. That one sax solo alone has utterly negated the genius of Magical Mystery Tour and Rubber Soul combined.

2659,Film Adaptation Of 'The Brothers Karamazov' Ends Where Most People Stop Reading Book,"LOS ANGELES'Executives at Paramount Pictures announced Monday that production had finally wrapped on The Brothers Karamazov, a new film adaptation that concludes at the precise moment most readers give up on the classic Russian novel. The 83-minute film, which is based on the first 142 or so pages of Fyodor Dostoevsky's acclaimed work, has already garnered attention for its stunning climax, in which the end credits suddenly appear midway through Katerina's tearful speech about an unpaid debt. ""We are very excited to be able to bring several chapters of this timeless masterpiece to the big screen,"" Paramount CEO Brad Grey said of the movie, which was shot, on and off, for two years. ""Anyone who's ever tried to sit down and trudge through this incredible book is going to be absolutely blown away by the faithfulness of our film."" ""It's all here,"" Grey added. ""The opening scene, that part a little bit later on where some big commotion is taking place but you're not quite sure what it is, that monastery thing they all go to'everything, just as you half-remember it."" According to director D.J. Caruso, great care was taken to painstakingly recreate the experience of slowly inching one's way through the dense work of literature. Starring Viggo Mortensen as both Alyosha and Aleksey, depending on the scene, and Laura Linney as someone's mother or aunt, the film opens with a three-minute-long summary taken directly from the novel's back cover. ""I've been picking up and putting down The Brothers Karamazov since college, so this was a dream project for me,"" Caruso said. ""I can still remember the first time I ever tried to read it. The obscure, often archaic prose, the overwhelming cast of characters, the frustration of reading 10 whole pages and then realizing that I didn't understand a thing'it all had such a profound effect on me."" ""I didn't want to lose any of that when I made the movie,"" he added. To that end, the film makes extensive use of a new state-of-the-art ""skim-over"" technology, which allows the more tedious depictions of existential inquiry to be played at double or even triple speed. In addition, the film reportedly contains a number of innovative ""go-back"" sequences, in which early scenes between Dmitri and Fyodor are replayed later in the movie with greater attention to detail, clearer exposition, and many of the actors in their correct roles. According to Paramount executives, The Brothers Karamazov will also include 12 separate intermissions, during which portions of the latest John Grisham'inspired film will appear onscreen. ""We used every tool at our disposal to make the experience of reading The Brothers Karamazov come to life,"" Caruso said of the film, which will be released in a special 15-minute Cliffs Notes version next year. ""I hope this is the kind of movie that, years from now, people are going to talk about maybe watching again from the beginning some day."" Despite sparsely attended screenings in which some viewers reportedly exited the theater quietly before the film's conclusion, initial audience reactions have been very positive. ""To be honest, I was a little worried that they wouldn't do the book justice,"" viewer Joel Ladin said a few days after watching the film. ""But when I saw Michael Caine up on that screen, repeating the same line over and over and over again as the audience looked on blurry-eyed, I knew they had pulled it off. The Brothers Karamazov is just as convoluted and painful as I remember it!"" Sources connected to the film have already confirmed that the DVD release of The Brothers Karamazov will include a special bonus scene consisting of the book's last sentence read aloud over a blank screen.","entertainment, movies, books, news, vol 45 issue 34, entertainment"

Following the announcement, all sources confirmed without hesitation and without prompting that the Beverly Hills Cop superstar's wish should, would, and must be fulfilled. ""Sure, if the right project came along, I would love to get behind the camera,"" Mr. Reiser said in a most fascinating interview on the TV Guide Network, his statement receiving the kind of soaring public ovation typically reserved for baseball stars Derek Jeter, Roger ""The Rocket"" Clemens, and world-renowned badminton legend Lin Dan. ""Right now I'm really focused on my family, but I'm always up for new professional challenges."" ""I am [the best],"" Reiser added. Mr. Reiser has previously delighted viewers in America and in other superior regions of the world with his much-adored Mad About You, a 30-minute comedy program that won the Golden Globe Award and passed the fair and honorable requirements of the State Council of the People's Republic of China. All this Mr. Reiser accomplished while gracefully shouldering the burden of his costar and clear unequal Helen Hunt. It is the opinion of everyone that Mrs. Hunt is inferior in every way to Mr. Reiser and would be nothing if not for his great benevolence toward those far below his station. Mr. Reiser's books Couplehood and Babyhood were excellent additions to both the Eastern and Western literary canons, and their lessons should be adhered to.","entertainment, celebrities, movies, yu wan mei, news in brief, vol 45 issue 30, entertainment"

2718,New Terminator Movie Brings J.D. Salinger Out Of Hiding,"CORNISH, NH'Famed literary giant and notorious recluse J.D. Salinger, who has not published any new work since 1965, came out of hiding Monday to gush about the new film Terminator Salvation, offering the world its first glimpse into his private life since his last interview nearly 30 years ago. ""I believe that a writer's privacy is among his most precious possessions, in that personal information about him distracts readers from what is most important: the work itself,"" the author of The Catcher In The Rye told reporters outside the Claremont Cinema 6 theater, moments after seeing the film for the third time. ""But on the other hand, the new revival of the Terminator franchise is just way too awesome for me to remain quiet any longer. Hello? Time-travel paradoxes? Freaking amazing!"" ""How sweet was it when that giant robot hand reached in through the roof and grabbed that old lady?"" Salinger added. ""Or when those motorcycle terminators detached from its legs and started speeding toward the escaping resistance fighters? Holy crap, was that fucking cool or what?"" Salinger, 90, explained that he first became a fan of the Terminator franchise in 1991, when he saw Terminator 2: Judgment Day and found the character of the young John Connor to be ""a striking figure of teenage alienation and disillusionment."" His interest in the series continued with his rental of the first Terminator film, which he described as ""almost as awesome as the second one,"" and his Amazon purchase of Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines on Blu-ray. Salinger, whose fictional works featuring the Glass family are considered some of the most influential contributions to 20th-century American literature, stated that he ""liked Terminator 3 okay,"" but that it was, in his opinion, ""nowhere near as cool as the new film."" In fact, the latest installment has so far exceeded his expectations that he has reversed nearly half a century of shunning the media. In an interview granted to The Paris Review, The New York Review Of Books, Time, Newsweek, and Us Weekly, Salinger called Christian Bale ""the most badass version of John Connor yet"" and described the film's postapocalyptic war with the machines setting as ""totally mind-blowing."" ""I admit I was worried about it as first,"" Salinger explained to enthralled reporters. ""The decision to go with McG as the new director seemed like a bad mistake'I mean, he made the Charlie's Angels movies for chrissakes'but boy oh boy was I worried for nothing. T4 may well be more awesome than the first three goddamn films combined, if you can believe that."" Added Salinger, ""Those hydrobots are scary as shit."" He then invited reporters into his remote New Hampshire compound to discuss the movie in more detail. ""Come in, come in, sit down, there's plenty of space,"" an exuberant Salinger told reporters, gesturing around his sitting room, which was filled with movie posters, comic books, and other Terminator collectibles, including a life-sized statue of the T-800 Model terminator as portrayed by Arnold Schwarzenegger. ""What a frigging inspired choice to cast Bryce Dallas Howard. She made so much more sense in that part than Claire Danes."" Although the sole film made from Salinger's work, My Foolish Heart, based on his short story ""Uncle Wiggily In Connecticut,"" was considered by Salinger to be such a bastardization of his prose that he never agreed to another adaptation, he now states that ""if McG wants to do any of my stuff''A Perfect Day For Bananafish'; Raise High The Roof Beam, Carpenters; hell, all of Nine Stories'he has my complete permission. Anything. Anything he wants."" When asked what he thought of today's novelists, and whether he had plans to publish any new work, Salinger replied that he loved it when the helicopter crashes and John Connor gets grabbed by that terminator that's only half a torso, and then he blows it away with the mounted machine gun. ""But by far the best part is when they reveal the T-800 for the first time and it looks just like a young Schwarzenegger,"" said Salinger, his voice reaching a fever pitch. ""I was like, 'Holy shit.' I guess they must've used CGI or something to get that face just right. But what a moment! I practically lost it, if you want to know the truth."" Besides setting the literary community abuzz, Salinger's decision to come out of seclusion has allowed scholars access to his massive archive of unpublished work for the first time. So far, critics have examined three never-before-seen novels, eight novellas, and more than two dozen short stories'all of which appear to be Terminator fan fiction. ""But make no mistake,"" said Salinger expert Professor Duane Hartworth of nearby Dartmouth College, ""this is without a doubt the most personal and affecting body of Terminator fan fiction ever discovered."" Salinger had only one negative comment for interviewers: He condemned the TV spin-off series The Sarah Connor Chronicles, saying that people who like that show are ""a bunch of goddamn phonies.""","entertainment, news, vol 45 issue 24, entertainment"

2728,Smoke Monster From 'Lost' Given Own Primetime Spin-Off Series,"BURBANK, CA'Executives at ABC announced Monday that the network will premier a new Lost spin-off series this fall based around that show's popular smoke monster character. The new series, a half-hour family-oriented comedy called Where There's Smoke, is touted by ABC as the new anchor of its Thursday-night lineup. ""Somewhere between the smoke monster's first appearance on Lost' when it was depicted as a strange unseen force uprooting trees'and that episode in season three where it grabbed Mr. Eko and smashed him against the ground until he was dead, this character became the breakout star of the show,"" said Stephen McPherson, president of ABC Entertainment. ""And that's exactly why we're so excited about Where There's Smoke. We get to see the monster's light comedic side in a show about life, love, and good friends having good times."" ""Because after all, Where There's Smoke, there's laughter,"" McPherson added. ABC sources reported that the series will transplant the evil black cloud from the island of Lost to the suburbs of Chicago, where it works as a sports radio host, surrounded by ""a whole new group of crazy characters."" Actress Lea Thompson has signed on to play the monster's long-suffering wife, who must put up with her husband's screwball antics while raising the couple's two rambunctious children, Tanner and Smoky, Jr. Veteran TV producer Chuck Lorre, of Dharma & Greg and The Big Bang Theory fame, will helm the show, which he said will focus mainly on the deadly creature's adjustments to suburbia and fatherhood, and its comically contentious relationship with its boss, a fussy radio station manager played by Richard Kind. ""The whole concept began with us asking, 'So what happens to the monster after it kills somebody and disappears down that ancient temple vent? What kind of life might it have?'"" Lorre said. ""And what we realized is that audiences really relate to this character and would like to see it in everyday situations, shooting the breeze with buddies at a local watering hole or murdering its son's soccer coach and depositing his lifeless body in a tree."" ""And of course, you'll be hearing lots of its classic catchphrase, 'Brrrrr, chk-chk-chk-chk, muuuuuuuuuuuuaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrhhh,'"" Lorre added. Lost producer Jack Bender has confirmed that the smoke monster will no longer be part of his show's regular cast. However, ABC has promised that Where There's Smoke will feature a number of guest appearances from Lost regulars. Sources said the pilot episode will feature an appearance by actor Michael Emerson as a slobby houseguest named Benjamin Linus who overstays his welcome, much to the chagrin of the smoke monster's wife. Though the project has been in development for almost a year, negotiations reached a standstill last winter when representatives for the mysterious, billowing actor expressed concern that their client would risk being typecast as ""just a smoke monster"" if the role were carried into a new series. ""We're always sensitive to these kinds of things, but we actually think this new vehicle will make people realize [the monster] is a sophisticated actor with a great deal of range,"" said McPherson, who agreed to pay the show's star $2 million per episode after scenes between the smoke monster and a nosy, ethnic next-door neighbor tested well with audiences. ""People love the smoke monster, and people love to laugh. This series is a can't-miss."" Added McPherson, ""And I'm not just blowing smoke here.""","entertainment, tv, news, vol 45 issue 22, entertainment"

2734,Radiohead Denies Influencing Local Band,"DAYTON, OH'Although they admit the Dayton-area group may have taken its name from a line in ""Karma Police,"" the members of Radiohead held a press conference in Ohio Monday to dismiss allegations that they played any role in helping to form the musical style of local band Hitler Hairdo. Radiohead front man Thom Yorke told reporters in no uncertain terms that his band has never met the four high school students who compose Hitler Hairdo, and insisted the moody alt-rock songs they perform in local bars ""could not possibly have been derived from [Radiohead's] subtle fusion of electronica, Krautrock, and experimental jazz."" ""There is absolutely no evidence to support Hitler Hairdo's claim that listening to OK Computer for the first time changed the whole way they thought about music,"" said Yorke, flanked by the other members of Radiohead, producer Nigel Godrich, and the band's lawyers. ""It's preposterous to think that, as genre-bending pioneers of post-punk techno-rock, we had anything to do with influencing this at-best average band. Anyone who's listened closely to their demo CD could tell you that."" Hitler Hairdo, whose MySpace page cites Radiohead as a ""major influence,"" has been playing house parties and open-mic nights around the Dayton area for more than a year, but has yet to gain a substantial following. In ""Bassist Needed"" fliers distributed last month, the band describes itself as ""a mix between Radiohead and Smashing Pumpkins, but primarily interested in the earlier guitar-driven sounds of Pablo Honey and The Bends."" ""That's absolute shite,"" Yorke said when asked for a response. ""The epochal, full-bodied shoegaziness of early Radiohead is completely absent from the sample tracks they put online, and where are the bracing yet approachable guitar patterns?"" ""And just look at their stupid band photo,"" added Yorke. ""Radiohead would never dress like that."" Though Yorke claimed the first three minutes of Hitler Hairdo's song ""Death (Or High School)"" are enough to prove the two ensembles are in no way affiliated, lead guitarist Jonny Greenwood said he wasn't so certain at first, and suggested his bandmates attend a live performance before passing judgment. But after chartering a private jet from England to Ohio to watch a Hitler Hairdo show, the space-rock megastars became even more convinced that they could not have shaped any part of the band's songwriting ethos. ""They were less like us live than they were in their abysmal online demos, if that's even possible,"" Greenwood told reporters. ""If that bridge in their fourth song was supposed to be an homage to the cold, esoteric sounds of Hail To The Thief, they missed the mark by a mile. We stayed for the whole thing, and I heard not one ethereal exploration of alienation and longing, no textured soundscapes or sparse, clanging percussion sequences evoking an abandoned playground in winter. Nothing."" Continued Greenwood, ""Just because you use a vocoder doesn't make you Radiohead."" In a recent interview in Rolling Stone, Radiohead members categorically denied any involvement in any of Hitler Hairdo's seven released songs, and assured fans that the subpar band's two unfinished melodies have ""no hope"" of attaining the swelling brilliance of even the weakest track on In Rainbows. ""To be perfectly honest, I think they sound much more like Oasis,"" Yorke told the magazine. ""Or maybe some shit pop band, like the Killers. Their only similarity to us is that they've made their music available for free online, and that hardly counts. After listening to every one of their songs and poring over all of their lyrics, I can say without hesitation that Radiohead has never influenced this band in any way, shape, or form."" When asked for comment, the band Coldplay'also listed by Hitler Hairdo as an influence'told reporters they were ""very flattered"" and ""love those guys.""","entertainment, music, summer music, news, vol 45 issue 21, entertainment"

According to school officials, a total of eight classes will be dropped or scaled back starting this fall, including Introduction to Oprahmatics, 20th-Century Oprah History, and the language arts elective American Winfrey Literature. ""We had to make some tough choices, and in the end, courses like Oprahnomics and World Winfrography were simply too expensive to keep around,"" announced principal Desiree Verdan, speaking before reporters in the school's Harpo Arts Auditorium. ""Sadly, with the high cost of Oprah-based education these days, eliminating these programs is our only recourse."" Added Verdan, ""This is definitely not one of our Favorite Things."" Established in 2007 to provide poor and disadvantaged South African children with the best Oprah-related schooling available, the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy has been instrumental in teaching young girls everything from how to read about Oprah, to how to write about Oprah, to the very basics of Theoretical Oprahology. Unfortunately, decreased funding for arts programs and ballooning expenses in recent months have all but crippled the South African school. ""It's devastating,"" vice principal Lerato Morris said. ""Our music department no longer has enough instruments for students to play the show's theme song, we've been forced to make do with the same old copies of O Magazine for months, and just yesterday one of our third-graders asked me who Gayle was."" ""It breaks your heart,"" he added. ""To have to look a little girl in the eye and tell her, 'No, we won't be learning about how to give away hundreds of free cars today.' It just breaks your heart."" So far, the school's math and science departments have been the hardest hit. Once compulsory courses, Winfranometry and Winfranometry II have had their funding slashed dramatically, while Chemistry'a class that examines the vast inner workings of Oprah and longtime boyfriend Stedman Graham's relationship through a series of controlled lab experiments'is down to its last three Bunsen burners. Extracurricular courses such as Advanced Oprah Studies, Oprah Latin, and the independent study program Laughing at Everything John Travolta Has to Say have also had their class sizes reduced by half. While faculty members have tried to take the cutbacks in stride, the loss of 20th-Century Oprah History this week has left many teachers more frustrated and discouraged than ever before. ""With history gone, how are students going to learn about the great Oprah-defining moments of our time,"" eighth-grade teacher Jakomina Smith said. ""The Phil Donahue Battle of 1985, the Great Tom Cruise Interview Disaster, the three dozen times Oprah has cried about her childhood on the show'we're talking about the fundamentals here."" According to Smith, if the school's curriculum continues to shrink at this rate, students may soon find themselves without the skills necessary to compete in today's Oprah world. ""How do we expect our kids to succeed, if they don't know the first thing about sitting down with Maya Angelou to discuss important life lessons?"" Smith said. ""This is South Africa, after all. We need to give these children a fighting chance."" Teachers aren't the only ones at the private school feeling distressed. A number of students, many of whom walk miles every day just to learn how much weight the talk show host lost on her new diet, also expressed concern over the changes. ""Oprah,"" eighth-grader Kimba Davidson said. ""Oprah, Oprah."" Added Davidson, ""Oprah?""","entertainment, news, vol 45 issue 17, entertainment"

""Hopefully Gary's struggle will inspire other men out there to empower themselves and stand up to frigid women who attempt to micromanage every last minute of their lives."" Early word from viewers has been overwhelmingly positive. Many particularly praised the chilling scene in which Mulkeen, played by actor Steven Weber, is viciously browbeaten by his wife into admitting he has been having an affair. ""I found Gary Mulkeen's harrowing true-life experience to be incredibly moving,"" viewer Richard Downey said. ""Here's a guy who journeyed deep into the heart of marital exasperation and came out the other side a stronger, newly single person. Finally, a movie that tells his side of the story."" Audiences have also responded enthusiastically to the film's suspenseful climax, in which Mulkeen narrowly escapes his wife's nagging clutches by throttling her to death in order to save himself from going out to yet another French restaurant. ""I was touched by the moment when Gary realized he could murder his controlling wife, get away with it, and go on to lead a normal, happy life on his own,"" Lifetime for Men devotee Gary Zander said. ""A life free of shrill accusations and neediness, where he might one day enjoy multiple exciting lovers at once and choose to spend all of his income on classic muscle cars."" ""Plus, it worked out that he got all the life insurance money, which was awesome,"" Zander added. Lifetime for Men debuted the original television movie as part of its spring schedule. Other programs in the new lineup include the weekly drama series A Life Unburdened, starring Treat Williams as a man who enjoys a series of meaningless sexual encounters and then dies rich and happy, and the hit Catching Up, in which two old college friends get together to drink cheap beer and eat sandwiches for 60 minutes. ""At Lifetime for Men, we strive to create programming that reflects the unique problems and issues confronting today's man,"" said Lifetime for Men president and CEO Fred Rasmussen. ""We like to think of it as sort of an entertainment roundtable, wherein we can finally address some of the frustrations that have been holding men back and keeping them from realizing their desire to do absolutely anything they want."" Rasmussen reported that production has already begun on a sequel to A Just Killing, which follows Mulkeen as he summons the courage to leave his dead wife's demanding sister after she becomes overly attached following their fifth night of sex together.","entertainment, featured section: masculinity, news, vol 45 issue 15, entertainment"

2796,'People' Magazine Reporter Held Hostage By Timothy Hutton Extremists,"LOS ANGELES'Law enforcement officials confirmed Monday that a journalist on assignment for People magazine has been taken hostage by a violent group of extremists who worship veteran film and television actor Timothy Hutton. Witnesses at the Sunshine Café said that a heavily armed faction calling itself the ""Ordinary People's Front"" entered the restaurant shortly before 10 p.m., abducted entertainment reporter Ryan Swanson, and fled the scene in a hail of gunfire. A videotape made by the Hutton zealots, who are devoted to such motion pictures as French Kiss and The Last Mimzy, arrived at the magazine's headquarters early the next morning. ""If the cowardly dogs at People do not soon pay tribute to the magnificence of character actor Timothy Hutton, then their colleague shall surely die,"" said a masked OPF member on the tape, which showed a severely beaten Swanson bound and gagged in front of a poster for the 1981 film Taps. ""The American media must recognize the unique talents of this Oscar-winning performer, who is also known for his directing. Unless our demands are met, the streets of North Hollywood shall run red with the blood of all nonbelievers."" ""Praise be the one, true Hutton,"" the extremist added before firing a semiautomatic weapon wildly into the air. The terrorist network, which is believed to contain more than a thousand Hutton sleeper cells nationwide, first formed in 1985 following the poor box-office performance of Turk 182!, an event Hutton fanatics still call ""the Great Injustice."" Since then, the radical organization has been linked to a number of highly coordinated and deadly attacks, including the bombing of an E! television studio in late 2002. ""It is the policy of People magazine not to negotiate with groups such as this,"" editor-in-chief John Huey said in a statement yesterday. ""As concerned as we all are for Ryan and his family, we cannot let fear and intimidation from militant Hutton sects determine the activities of America's favorite celebrity news magazine."" ""We made that vow after publishing a six-page spread on Benjamin Bratt in 2001,"" Huey added. The abduction of Swanson marks the third incident of Hutton-related violence in the past eight months. The OPF has already claimed responsibility for the torture and hanging of Access Hollywood producer Donald Klein earlier this year, as well as the gory beheading of Us Weekly film critic Sue Banks following her negative review of Secret Window in 2004. In addition, law enforcement officials believe that a car bombing during the 2000 Golden Globes may have been in retaliation for the award show's failure to recognize Hutton for his work in The General's Daughter. ""These are criminals, plain and simple, and they need to be stopped,"" said Los Angeles police chief William Bratton, who believes the Hutton extremists train somewhere deep in the hills of Hollywood. ""Rest assured, we will hunt down this group, and all groups like it, until every last Hutton operative from Burbank to Studio City is destroyed."" The kidnappers have reportedly sent a list of demands insisting that People magazine print a half-page feature on Hutton's New York restaurant venture P.J. Clarke's, provide them with a suitcase containing $500,000 in unmarked bills, and include the actor ""without fail"" in the next People.com ""Who Looked Hot?"" web column. ""If we do not receive what we have asked for, then thousands will be terminated as cruelly and mercilessly as Timothy Hutton's overlooked detective series, The Nero Wolfe Mysteries,"" read an accompanying note, scrawled in blood. Moderate Timothy Hutton followers have responded to the attacks with shock and outrage. ""The crazed extremism of a select few should not tarnish the beliefs of those who admire Mr. Hutton for his boyish good looks and offhand charm,"" Hutton moderate Patricia Cook said. ""True followers of The One know that he would never condone the act of murder."" Actor Timothy Hutton is currently filming a new season of the TNT drama Leverage and could not be reached for comment.","entertainment, celebrities, terrorism, news, vol 45 issue 13, entertainment"

2802,"Oh No, Performers Coming Into Audience","PITTSBURGH'Audience members at the Benedum Center for the Performing Arts are reporting that, oh God, no, approximately 20 extremely enthusiastic actors are approaching the edge of the stage and appear determined to continue their current musical number in the main seating area. ""Oh, man, are they? Shit,"" one audience member was overheard saying as the energetic ensemble began filing down previously unseen stairs and past the front row. ""Shit, shit, shit."" Increasingly uncomfortable audience sources have also confirmed that the performers are proceeding down the aisle with crisp, larger-than-normal steps timed perfectly to the music. Even more shocking, some appear intent on interacting with non'cast members. ""Their smiles are so big,"" a female theatergoer said while pretending to look for something in her purse. ""Why does that one have a cordless microphone? Is he going to try to talk to us?"" ""I have to go to the restroom,"" she added. While it remains unclear how long this horrifying breach of the fourth wall will last, or why the actors worked so hard to create a fictional distance between themselves and the audience if they had no intention of maintaining it, past productions suggest there are still five minutes left in the current number. Some predict the cast will return to the stage before the song's conclusion, but others fear they may stay in the aisles, making unnerving eye contact and blocking all available exits. Thus far, the actors have ignored audience members' squirms and anxious expressions, opting instead to clap in an effort to get everyone to clap along with them. Oh, no, more singing and dancing performers have just entered the balcony. ""Their makeup looks way scarier under normal lighting,"" one theater patron whispered. ""Especially that one kid playing the old man."" Audience members have given no indication that the actors' increased proximity has enhanced their experience, or given them a sense of involvement in the production. Some have questioned, however, whether or not it is out-of-character for the play's antagonist to be doing the twist with the show's protagonist, especially before the conflict between the two has been resolved. While most theatergoers have avoided meeting the actors' gaze by smiling awkwardly and staring straight ahead, the roughly 76 people seated on the aisles have been less fortunate. Performers are currently removing them from their seats and are apparently forcing them to participate in some kind of humiliating choreographed dance. Jesus Christ, one actor just did a jumping toe-touch from the stage into the audience, pumped his fist, and high-fived a fellow performer, prompting those in the first several rows to jerk back in their seats and shield their heads. ""Why can't we just watch the play?"" a female audience member asked a man who is possibly her husband. ""When I saw this with Diane in New York, I swear, David, I swear they didn't do this."" Although the exodus into the seating area was not announced, there have been several indications that the actors could be capable of ruining the invisible boundary between them and the paying public. During the previous song, the ensemble sang the words, ""For all of us,"" and gestured not only to themselves, but also to the audience. A second, more ominous sign was the sudden raising of the houselights during the song's chorus'a slight change in mood that caused some worried attendees to look around and ask, ""What's going on?"" And, just before the upbeat percussive section that unleashed the thespians, a male lead turned his head sharply to the audience and said, ""Here we go."" By then, however, it was too late. Witnesses say one actor has now perched himself on the back of a seat and started singing directly to a small child. The boy has responded by clinging to his mother and burying his face into her chest. ""They're bringing that fat guy back onstage with them,"" an audience member said. ""Oh, Christ, what are they going to make him do? Why'why don't they just leave us alone?""","entertainment, news, vol 45 issue 12, entertainment"

2812,Tree Featured In 'The Deer Hunter' Dies,"BLUE RIDGE MOUNTAINS, NC'The tree best known for portraying an eastern hemlock in the 1978 film The Deer Hunter passed away Monday morning on the steep, north-facing slope it called home. The tree was 286. After shooting to stardom in the late 1970s with its scene-stealing turn as a stately old-growth conifer in The Deer Hunter, the tree soon cemented its reputation as one of Hollywood's most dependable character actors. According to its publicist, the woody plant and beloved fixture of nearly 40 feature films died of complications relating to adelgid beetles and lightning. ""It will be missed,"" Deer Hunter costar Robert De Niro said. ""We took a shine to each other immediately. That tree taught me a lot about acting and about life."" The veteran entertainer worked continuously throughout its 43-year career, winning respect in the movie industry for its stoic, graceful presence, its unassuming branches, and its deep commitment to the craft of acting. Much of the tree's success stemmed from its remarkable range across genres and its ability to convincingly portray a wide variety of deciduous and broadleaf North American species. ""[The tree] was a consummate professional that truly lived for its work,"" said filmmaker and friend Michael Mann, who cast the 98-foot-tall plant in its acclaimed role as an Adirondack black spruce in the background of 1992's The Last Of The Mohicans. ""On Mohicans we would sometimes do 30 or 40 takes, and each time it gave us something totally different and interesting. This is a sad day for cinema."" Planted in 1722, the tree got its first taste of show business after a chance meeting with high-powered agent Sue Mengers during her camping trip in the summer of 1972. According to Hollywood insiders, Mengers was instrumental in helping the tree land its breakout role as a piece of riverside foliage in John Boorman's classic Deliverance. ""Even then, you could see this special sort of magnetism that it had,"" said Deliverance costar Jon Voight, who later reteamed with the Tsuga canadensis for a 48-frame tracking shot in the 1985 thriller Runaway Train. ""I remember it seeming very nervous its first day on set. But after a few takes, it was just a total natural and a pleasure to work with."" A number of film and television projects followed, including a memorable guest appearance as a treacherous-mountain-pass fir in a 1974 episode of Gunsmoke. But its most famous role was undoubtedly its portrayal of a melancholy but proud Western Pennsylvania hemlock in Michael Cimino's Oscar-winning epic The Deer Hunter. ""I actually didn't want to cast it at first, because the role was originally written for a hardwood sapling,"" said Cimino, who featured the tree prominently in two long exterior shots in the film's famous ""last hunt"" sequence. ""But its screen test was just so fearless and so moving. It had that rare quality in a coniferous performer where you just believed everything it did."" Failing to capitalize on the success of The Deer Hunter, the tree endured some lean years in the 1980s, including a much-derided appearance in a 1987 Honeycomb Hideout commercial and a series of public service announcements for the Smokey the Bear campaign. It also attracted unwanted attention in 1989 following rumors of a love affair with actress Margot Kidder. But the 1990s saw a series of high-profile comeback roles, and the tree won widespread critical praise in 1993 when it was leaned against by Harrison Ford during a wilderness escape scene in The Fugitive. More recently it was cast as one of the trees glimpsed through the living room window in Monster's Ball, and in the HBO miniseries John Adams, for which it was briefly considered for the title role until disagreements emerged over the project's creative direction. Attorneys announced Monday that, in accordance with its will, the tree will be carved into canoes for underprivileged youths.","entertainment, news, vol 45 issue 12, entertainment"

2861,Tina Turner Burns Down Legs For Insurance Money,"LOS ANGELES'Police officers arrested Tina Turner this week on suspicion of arson, reckless endangerment, and insurance fraud, following allegations that the legendary R&B; singer burned down her legs for financial gain. The arrest is the culmination of a month-long investigation into the four-alarm blaze that injured three firemen, threatened nearby properties, and completely destroyed Turner's lower extremities. Payment of a $3.2 million insurance policy the entertainer had on her legs will be put on hold until after trial. ""At first it appeared to be just another accidental fire,"" lead detective Jason Hendricks said. ""However, something about Ms. Turner's story didn't add up. She claimed to have gone to the store, only to return an hour later and find her lower half already in flames. Yet evidence seems to suggest that Ms. Turner was at the scene of the crime the entire time."" Added Hendricks, ""We have strong reason to believe Tina Turner burned herself down."" According to investigators, Turner was on hand to show officials around the scene of the tragedy, and seemed to exhibit genuine grief over the loss of her two legs. Though Turner initially blamed the fire on an electrical shortage, investigators noted that everything of value in the surrounding area, including a $600 pair of high heels, had been removed prior to the blaze. Investigators also found evidence of an accelerant, and determined that Turner's ankles had been packed with newspapers and other flammable materials. A further search of the wreckage turned up a bottle of turpentine, as well as a quart of lighter fluid, though Turner denied owning either. When confronted with the new findings, Turner claimed that she had witnessed several teenagers sneaking around her legs the night before, and offered brief descriptions of three African American youths in hooded sweatshirts. ""She had us convinced at first,"" said Michael Schwartz, another crime-scene detective, who carried the legendary singer to the L.A. precinct to be fingerprinted. ""But when we discovered that Turner had taken out a second insurance policy, only days before the blaze, our suspicions were confirmed."" ""It's amazing what a little bit of money can make a person do,"" Hendricks continued. This is the latest in a string of high-profile insurance scams. Last year, Jennifer Lopez claimed her posterior had been damaged in a rear-end collision, but was later spotted taking the intact buttocks to the gym. In 2005, Eric Clapton told officials that his hands had been stolen, though a three-month investigation later revealed that they were only hidden inside a pair of roomy sleeves. ""We intend to prosecute this crime to the greatest extent we can,"" said District Attorney Robert Gower, speaking on the steps of the Los Angeles Superior Court. ""I don't care who you are or what you've done, no one'not even Tina Turner'is above the law. Let's just say she'll soon be doing her private dancing behind bars. And without legs."" Because she has residences in London, France, and Switzerland, a federal judge has refused Turner bail, calling her a possible flight risk. Throughout it all, Turner's lawyers have insisted that the charges are ""absurd,"" and that their client will be exonerated. ""A trial will find Ms. Turner innocent of all charges,"" attorney Anthony Puterman said. ""Our client was devastated by the loss of her legs, as she has many fond memories of walking, running, and performing with them. They were very much a part of her."" ""Careless though it may have been, this was just an accident,"" Puterman continued. ""Those legs were old and dry. Anything could have set them off.""","entertainment, news, vol 45 issue 04, entertainment"

2876,What A Year This Was!,"Wow! Has it been 365 days already? It seems like just yesterday I was looking back on 2007. I guess it's true that time flies when you're having funEEHollywood Fun! This year really took the cake, though. Twins for Bradgelina, Olympic mania, and the return of Morton Downey, Jr.! But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's now point backwards to the year that was 2008EE. Before we look back, here's the first of my famous In and Out selections, where I put it all on the line and tell you what we can say ""evoir"" to in the coming year. In for 2009: Hats. Nothing classes up a head like a hat. Out for 2009: Sweatbands. Unless you're at a gym or running a marathon, I don't want to see these. 2008 was the year of the Jonas Bothers. Peppy, good looking, and they can dance, too. ""Burning Up"" was the song for the summer, fall, winter, and spring combined! Now, I love music, and I appreciate cryptic names, but I can't get my head around the Jonas Bothers. What a weird name! The Jonas BothersEEbothers whom exactly? It seems that they're all related, so you'd think that the Jonas Family would have been more appropriate. 2008 was the year of Stephanie Meyers. Since there wasn't""new Harry Potter book to line up for at midnight the day it was released, I had to stand in line for a midnight sale of the new book in the Twilight series. I didn't know anything about it, so I had to buy all four at once, but you know what? It was completely engrossing! I sat down and read about the 100-year-old vampire falling in love with the 17-year-old girl and it took me back to a more innocent time, when I was a young boy hoping for someone exotic and beautiful to come take me away from the boredom of high school. Fortunately, I discovered the Movies, and that was the only exotic affair I needed. Oh, and the great thing about Twilight was that the first movie in the series also came out this year, and I was able to stand in line for a midnight screening of that as well! Firsties! In for 2009: Saying ""Totes!"" for ""totally,"" or to provide an affirmation to something. Out for 2009: Saying ""Not!"" to negate someone else's statement. 2008 was the year for Ashford and Simpson. Just when you think you've heard the last of them, this singing duo proved that they were still ""Solid As A Rock"" and had a baby boy named Bronx! Weirdly, the singer from the band Fall Out Boy was somehow involved as well. I know, I knowEfmusicians. Am I right? 2008 was the year for Beverly Hills 90210. The teen drama that gave us Brenda, Brandon, Dylan, Steve, Kelly, Andrea, David, Donna, Valerie, Claire, Nat, Ray, Carly, Noah, Gina, and Matt came back with a vengeance! Only this new version is updated for today's kids, and has the edgier name 90210.

2877,Dame Judi Dench Begins Dating Female DJ,"LOS ANGELES'Hollywood's paparazzi and celebrity gossip-hounds were abuzz with excitement this year, when notorious party girl and multiple-BAFTA-award-winning actress Dame Judi Dench, 74, entered into a lesbian love affair with a popular nightclub disc jockey. Though Dench had never made her sexual preference public, most assumed her to be heterosexual, since she has been romantically linked to such hunky actors as her late husband, Michael Williams. But she shocked the media when photos emerged in early July showing the classically trained Dench and a 32-year-old female DJ canoodling in L.A. hotspot Chateau Marmont. The Royal Shakespeare Company veteran and tabloid favorite was soon swarmed by paparazzi, who also published images of Dench drunkenly making out with her gaunt-looking, bleached-blonde lover in the alley behind D.C.'s most elite club, the Lotus Range. In September, Us Weekly ran an exclusive claiming that the tomboyish DJ treated Dench to a sexy lap dance in full view of the revelers at New York's Gramercy Room. ""They're definitely into each other,"" one club patron told the gossip rag. ""It was hot and heavy."" The affair caps off a tailspin of erratic behavior by Dench. While shooting Notes On A Scandal back in 2006, the hard-partying septegenarian was known to show up on set late and hungover, or sometimes not at all. In March 2007 she was pulled over for driving under the influence with fellow starlets Dame Maggie Smith and Angela Lansbury, and exposed her crotch to paparazzi while exiting her SUV. While some claim Dench's tryst with the lesbian DJ is bringing the former Masterpiece Theatre star back down to earth, the relationship has not been without its rough spots. This November, several witnessed the Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts sobbing outside the chic London nightclub Boujis, after the waifish disc jockey ""went ballistic"" on Dench for dancing suggestively with close friend and actor Patrick Stewart. The 68-year-old Stewart reportedly had to physically restrain Dench's lesbian lover, who was kicking the British screen legend and spitting in her face. ""The girls are fine,"" Dench's publicist Leslie Sloane Zelnick said. ""They just had a little spat."" Though Dench has said in multiple interviews that her family is supportive of the relationship, her estranged 112-year-old father, Reginald Arthur Dench'a recovering alcoholic and ex-convict'has publicly condemned the romance.","entertainment, celebrities, news, vol 44 issue 52, entertainment"

2888,Staten Island Historians Piece Together Genealogy Of Wu-Tang Clan,"NEW YORK'In what many are calling the most comprehensive study of its kind, Staten Island historians Robert Wilburn and Charles Tinsley have successfully traced the lines of the infamous Wu-Tang Clan all the way back to 1993 A.D. The monumental undertaking, which is being hailed as a major breakthrough in the field of hip-hop genealogy, used a series of historical records'including Wu-Tang Forever, Iron Flag, and 8 Diagrams'to piece together the group's vast and intricate ancestry. ""Through our exhaustive research, we have determined not only the start of the Wu-Tang Clan's reign, but also the very moment of its legendary downfall,"" said Wilburn, who has authored numerous books on the House of RZA. ""Indeed, we now have conclusive proof as to why all the other wannabe MCs bowed down to this dynastic force."" According to Wilburn, it took trained scholars hundreds of hours to parse out Wu-Tang's complex lineage, with experts in nearly every discipline studying the group's dope oral traditions, as well as its customary and often fresh style of dress. ""It was an immense project,"" said Tinsley, who coauthored the 450-page genealogical report. ""For instance, it took us months to conclude that Ol' Dirty Bastard, Dirt McGirt, Big Baby Jesus, Osirus, Dirt Dog, and Peanut the Kidnapper were all the same person."" ""Still, a number of exciting new discoveries were made,"" Tinsley continued. ""We learned that RZA does in fact come from the same royal bloodline as Prince Rakim, and that Method Man, as many have suspected in the past, always holds the mic sideways when bustin'."" In all, nearly 300 descendants of the Wu-Tang Clan were identified and cataloged by the two historians, including Buddha Monk, Hook Ninja, K-Blunt, Tommy Whispers, Kryme Life, and Trife Da God. Tinsley was quick to note, however, that the total number of Wu-Tang descendants was impossible to calculate, and could very well reach into the tens of thousands. ""While the Clan is generally associated with tales of conquest, slaughter, and 'bringing da motherfuckin' ruckus,' it must also be noted that its members were prolific lovers who expanded the empire by sowing their seed all across the country,"" Tinsley said. ""Who knows, perhaps my very own children are direct descendants of Ghostface Killah."" Emerging from the slums of Shaolin'located near Wudang Mountain in Park Hill, Staten Island'the Wu-Tang Clan went on to form the largest contiguous rap empire of the late 20th century. The Clan flourished under the rule of RZA, who led his lyrical assassins into a number of heated freestyle battles, and introduced them to a string of new influences, including Kung Fu films and silver-age Iron Man comics. ""During its height, the Wu-Tang Clan acquired a great deal of wealth and notoriety,"" Wilburn said. ""One need only look at Ol' Dirty Bastard's dental records to get a sense of the incredible treasures they possessed."" Despite conquering nearly 80 percent of the rap world, Wilburn said that the Clan's downfall was inevitable. Seeking even greater riches, and fueled by internal feuds, key members such as GZA, Raekwon, Masta Killa, U-God, and Inspectah Deck soon set out on their own. This dynastic split, Wilburn claimed, is what makes the Wu-Tang Clan's lineage so hard to piece together. ""Tracing the exact origin of descendants like Lord Superb, Maddam Scheez, Free Murda, and June Lova is nearly impossible, as only a small percentage of their personal records were ever released and firsthand accounts often differ greatly,"" Wilburn said. ""However, our greatest challenge may be that many of the artifacts from this era have been completely lost to time."" ""Many believe that the location of the original 36 Chambers is buried somewhere beneath what today is the Staten Island Mall,"" Wilburn continued. ""Unfortunately, unless that T.J. Maxx shuts down, and the mall's food court goes out of business, we may never know the truth."" ""Still, one thing remains certain,"" Wilburn added. ""The Wu-Tang Clan was nothing to fuck with.""","entertainment, celebrities, music, summer music, news, vol 44 issue 50, entertainment"
2889,Why Don't They Make A Second 'Godfather' Movie?,"As a bona fide movie buff, it pains me to see the drivel that Hollywood churns out nowadays. Every week it's another lamebrained action flick or raunchy teen comedy aimed at the lowest common denominator. And the most infuriating part is that often there is an idea for an amazing film sitting right under Hollywood's nose and they don't even see it. Sometimes I just want to grab Hollywood by the shoulders, shake it, and tell it what a masterpiece it's missing out on. For instance, can anyone give me one good reason why they haven't made a second Godfather movie? Think about it. It's a travesty. First of all, a follow-up to the 1972 epic American classic would have tremendous market potential and franchise capability. This is an Oscar-winning tour de force that made millions and millions of dollars we're talking about here. It should be a no-brainer. Moreover, the timing is great. Ideally they would have released the sequel within a few years of the original, but a second Godfather film now would coincide perfectly with the current renewed interest in '70s-era cinema. And what better way to pay tribute to the great filmmakers of the Easy Riders, Raging Bulls generation than to reunite legendary director Francis Ford Coppola with innovative cinematographer Gordon Willis and shoot a little slice of celluloid heaven called The Godfather 2? It wouldn't just be a treat for us die-hard Godfather nuts, either. Audiences would come out in droves to catch up with the Corleones after almost four decades. Granted, they'd probably have to pare down the family drama a bit. If they packed The Godfather 2 full of backstory it would just confuse all the people who never saw the first film. And, while it might be a challenge to come up with fresh dialogue that doesn't feel dated, there are so many great lines from the original that they practically wouldn't have to. ""Don't take his gun, but take the cannoli,"" and, ""Tell Mr. Corleone he sleeps with the fishes."" If they brought any of these classic catchphrases back in the sequel, the crowd would stand up and cheer for more. Just think of all the questions left unanswered at the end of The Godfather! What would happen to Michael? Would he run the family business the way his father did, or would he be more easygoing? And what about Michael's brother Fredo? God, what an amazing character. I could see him taking over the operation one day if Michael ever decided to retire and settle down with Kay. What if the whole Corleone family goes straight and open up a little pasticerria in Greenwich Village'and Michael Jr.'s getting married, so they scramble to get all the preparations done in time for the big day and, in the middle of all the commotion, Clemenza has a heart attack? That could be quite poignant and powerful. The possibilities are endless. Maybe they fall on hard times and team up with the other families to buy a local baseball team, or they decide it's time to leave New York but they come to realize that all their memories are there, and always will be, and the movie ends with Michael standing under the Brooklyn Bridge: ""This is my town. This is home."" Man, I'm getting chills just thinking about it. They would have to get a new cast, of course. After 36 years it would be ludicrous to use the same actors. Luckily, there's a slew of hungry young talent out there ready to knock The Godfather 2 out of the park. Al Pacino never quite had the chance to milk the role for all it was worth, but I think a brooding, intense actor like Armand Assante could really sink his teeth into it. They could get a Michael Imperioli or a River Phoenix to play Assante's trigger-happy, hotheaded nephew who runs afoul of a rival crime family and winds up turning sides. That could be pretty genius, actually. Obviously, the one thing Godfather-lovers are going to want to see in G2 is more Don Corleone. Since he died in the first film, the only believable way they could bring him back in the sequel would be in a dream sequence. The great Marlon Brando has passed on, of course, so they'd have to get someone with the same gravitas. Jon Voight, perhaps. Then they could insert a long, ethereal scene right in the middle of the movie where Assante and Voight walk around on a vineyard and just reminisce about all the things that have happened to the family over the years and what a crazy ride it's been. I can practically smell the Oscars right now. They really should have thought of this 30 years ago. It's a slam dunk! I'm sure Francis Coppola doesn't want to be known for the rest of his life as that guy who made The Godfather and then disappeared off the face of the earth. How many times do you think he's had people come up to him and ask, ""Hey, man, when are you going to make a sequel to The Godfather?"" He probably gets it every day. If I were him, I wouldn't make the same mistake Stallone made by only doing one Rocky. I'd start shooting a sequel immediately, and maybe even get my daughter to write the script. So turn on that green light, Hollywood. It's been decades since America's been entertained by the lives of a fictional mob family, and the time is right. Trust me on this one. I'm making you an offer you can't refuse.","opinion, entertainment, movies, commentary, vol 44 issue 49, william tullo, entertainment"

2893,Blue Angels Hold First-Ever Open Tryouts,"PENSACOLA, FL'Harold Enderby's friends say that when he first saw the Navy's televised announcement that the Flight Demonstration Squadron, better known as the Blue Angels, would be holding open tryouts for the first time in its history, the lifelong aviation buff turned to his fellow sanitation workers at Doug's Dugout Bar-N-Grill and said, ""Mark my words'I'm going to be a Blue Angel if it's the last thing I do."" And this Sunday, that dream came true for an incredible 43 seconds, as Enderby got the chance to fly the famed Blue Angels' F/A-18 Hornet directly into the tarmac during the first day of the Navy's most dramatic'and colorful'audition program ever. Since 1946, the Blue Angels have recruited only elite military fighter pilots. But this week and this week only, the Navy is giving the public a rare treat: allowing ordinary, everyday citizens a chance to try out for the world's premiere stunt flying team. Memorial services for Enderby, along with five other late aspiring aviators and 81 others from the assembled crowd and surrounding communities, will begin Friday and continue throughout the month. ""Some of these folks may not have worked their way through four years of the Naval Academy, 10 years of flying missions as a naval aviator on three different carriers, two sessions at the fighter school at Miramar, and another 18 months of special aerobatics and flight operations here at Pensacola'like I did'but they sure had spirit,"" Blue Angel member Johnny Krewsh said. ""They gave it their all and that's what counts. My hat is off to them, and to their surviving family members."" With would-be pilots lining up by the thousands and crowds predicted to grow even larger over the next six days, the excitement and death toll are both expected to rise. ""It was quite a sight to see so many citizens arriving at the airbase entrance just hours after the initial announcement,"" said Lt. Cmdr. Maxfield Walton, the officer in charge of registering and interviewing the excited applicants, as well as contacting their next of kin. ""Who knows? Your old math teacher, a cab driver, the guy in the next cubicle who can't seem to do anything right'anybody could be the next Chuck Yeager. Now this is their chance to strap themselves into aEE $41 million 1,200 mile-per-hour airplane and show us what they can do.""hough some of the amateur Angels got into the cockpit, suddenly realized they didn't know what they were doing, and jumped right back out, Navy officials said all who put aside their fears or lack of experience or physical disability to climb aboard a fighter jet were stars today. The once-in-a-lifetime tryouts will continue throughout the week. But long after the flames resulting from this unique recruiting experiment have died'which FEMA personnel said should happen within 10 days'the fire of these plucky applicants' enthusiasm will shine on. The enthusiasm of Erin Rappaport, a Springfield, IL eighth-grader who played flight simulators on her PlayStation and impressed Naval flight teams when she sat in the F/A-18 Hornet's cockpit for the first time and already knew, or could guess,EE the functions of many of the jet's 188 different controls. ""at sounds just like Erin,"" said Rappaport's math teacher, Janice Billingsly. ""We'll miss her very much."" Erin wasn't the only special person who flew here today; she wasn't the only female, or the only person to crash into Pino's Pizza on Grove Avenue, or even the youngest. But, witnesses said, she displayed incredible grit and a can-do attitude to her classmates who were inside eating pizza when she tried to fly by and wave. Officials also singled out the determination of San Dimas, CA's Alfred K. McAllister'affectionately described by Blue Angels flight instructor Harmon Links as a ""hell of a tough old guy""'who took off and just kept going. ""We almost couldn't find enough phone books for him to sit on, and he decided against the helmet because it knocked off his glasses,"" Links said. ""But what a trooper. He never once looked back. Radar finally lost track of him about 200 miles out over the Atlantic, still climbing."" ""I think he thought he got to keep the plane!"" Links added. ""If we ever locate and recover the wreckage, we hope to give him the proper burial he deserves."" Others noted the beaming face of Peter Collsworthy, a foreman at an Akron, OH cement plant for the past 25 years, who got the biggest roars from the crowd by far. ""He may have flunked the 'near-miss' part of the high-speed aerobatic pass, caused the death of a man with 17 years' flight experience when he sheared the wing off of Cmdr. Hickock's plane, vomited into his helmet, panicked, inverted the aircraft with the throttles maxed, and hit Mach 1 just before crashing into bleachers full of spectators with almost a full load of fuel,"" Blue Angels commanding officer Brock Saxon said. ""But he nailed the steep climb and the steep dive, and he certainly had showmanship. If there's one thing I keep telling my cadets, it's that you can't teach enthusiasm. I think we all learned a little something about the power of raw enthusiasm here today."" ""That crowd was rocking out to 'Danger Zone' when he plummeted into them at the speed of sound,"" said Lois Collsworthy, Peter's widow. ""That would have meant a lot to him. He always loved that song.""ee  ","entertainment, death, news, vol 44 issue 48, entertainment"

2899,Donald Fagen Defends Steely Dan To Friends,"NEW YORK'While having drinks with friends at a local bar Monday, Donald Fagen, 60, a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee and cofounder of the multiplatinum-selling American rock band Steely Dan, was once again forced to defend his appreciation for the multiplatinum-selling American rock band Steely Dan. ""Look, I understand. It's an acquired taste,"" Fagen said after putting his group's 1978 hit ""Deacon Blues"" on the bar's jukebox. ""I wasn't that into it at first, either. But when you really listen to the unbelievable production values and the wry, perfectly crafted lyrics'it's just great art, okay? You should definitely give 'the Dan' a shot."" Fagen went on to cite additional evidence in defense of his admiration for the music, including the disparate jazz, R&B;, and blues influences that pervade the band's music, and the ultraclean sound that became the group's hallmark. ""No one attained that level of perfection in the studio,"" Fagen said. ""Do you know how many guitar players tried and failed to nail the solo on the song 'Peg'? Six. Six professional session guitar players. That's commitment to a vision, if you ask me."" ""Not to mention almost ruining Michael McDonald's voice just to get the background vocals on that track,"" Fagen added. Though Fagen remained effusive about Steely Dan throughout the debate, he did eventually concede that the song ""True Companion"" from the Heavy Metal soundtrack was ""really gay."" He was quick to point out, however, that the track was not technically a Steely Dan composition, but rather a Donald Fagen solo project. ""No way you'd be saying this crap if you'd seen Steely Dan play live as many times as I have,"" Fagen reportedly told his companions after purchasing them a second round of drinks. ""Plus [Steely Dan cofounder] Walter Becker is a super nice guy."" In an attempt to enlighten his friends and possibly pique their curiosity to the point where they would accept his standing offer to burn them copies of Steely Dan's 1974 album Pretzel Logic, Fagen went so far as to bring up some of the more esoteric trivia pertaining to the group. ""Everybody knows that Steely Dan is named after a dildo, but were you aware that Chevy Chase played drums when the band was called the Leather Canary?"" said Fagen, referring to his formative musical years at Bard College in upstate New York. ""Of course, that was way before he went on to Saturday Night Live fame."" Even after his acquaintances roundly dismissed Steely Dan as ""pussy music,"" Fagen vehemently maintained that the band has contributed significantly to the rock and roll genre, and described his and Becker's unorthodox instrumentation choices and song arrangements as ""bold."" ""God forbid someone take a chance by having more than three chord changes in a song,"" Fagen said. ""You can't just write it all off as 'shitty jazz fusion' because there are a few horns in the band. And what about 'Bodhisattva' and 'Show Biz Kids' on Countdown To Ecstasy? Don't sit there and tell me that those tunes don't rock."" Though Fagen remains loyal to Steely Dan and more or less has reverence for the band's entire catalog, he said that he is the first to admit the shortcomings of the music. ""No one knows better than I do that this stuff can get extremely self-indulgent,"" Fagen said. ""And, yes, I realize that all the preciousness and apparent awe at its own cleverness can be a little too much to stomach sometimes. Hell, some of Gaucho is even too goddamned smooth for me."" ""It's no Dire Straits, I'll give you that,"" Fagen added.","entertainment, celebrities, music, news, vol 44 issue 46, entertainment"

2902,"As An Older World's Strongest Man, There Are Certain Trucks I Can't Pull Anymore","Aging is tough. The hardest part for me has been coming to grips with the fact that some of the physical abilities I took for granted when I was younger deteriorated before I really had the chance to appreciate them. I thought I would be fit and healthy forever, and then it's like I woke up one day and suddenly I couldn't see as well, my hearing was bad, and when I went to pull a 40-ton timber truck 110 feet, I could barely get the thing moving. As a 54-year-old World's Strongest Man, I like to think I've aged with dignity and grace. But as I enter my golden years of deadlifting 17,000 silver dollars, I realize that you must approach life with a certain amount of acceptance. Acceptance that you just can't walk up to a Mack truck filled with 40,000 pounds of coal, strap yourself into a harness, grab a rope, and start hauling anymore. Christ, these days I'm sore for a whole week after pulling 20,000 or even 15,000 pounds of coal. Sometimes, depending on how my old bones feel in the morning, I have to replace the Mack truck with a smaller dump truck, or a tractor. Unfortunately, with the way my muscles stiffen up nowadays, my time of competitively hauling heavy-duty flatbeds and fire engines are long past, and can only be relived by watching old home videos or ESPN2 at three in the morning. It's tough not to reminisce about your days as a younger World's Strongest Man when you get to be an older World's Strongest Man like myself. I remember in wilder times my strong-man friends Geoff Capes, Lars Hedlund, and I would get together and toss a couple dozen 50-pound kegs over a 14-foot steel wall with ease. Now when we get together, it's like watching a bunch of nursing home patients let out for their daily recreation period. ""Can we lower the bar to 7 feet?"" Lars will say. ""Thirty-five-pound kegs today?"" Geoff jokes. Sure, we'll laugh at ourselves while we foolishly try to act like the young strongest men we once were, but I've always felt that underneath that laughter is an undercurrent of deep uncertainty. I wonder if we'll ever experience the same kind of fulfillment that came with lifting and placing 350-pound concrete balls onto chest-high platforms. Will anything ever fill the void left by no longer being able to lift a really, really large log over our heads? These are the kinds of things I think about when I'm sorting through boxes in my attic and I find myself unable to bend a steel bar around my neck as fast as I used to. I guess when you get down to it, what really bothers me is, now that I'm an older World's Strongest Man, I finally see how our society celebrates the World's Strongest youth, and pretends like its World's Strongest elders don't even exist. I get it. No one wants to pay to see a guy get winded after turning over only two cars. But sometimes I start to wonder if anybody even cares about me anymore, or remembers that there was a time when I was the young, massively built Adonis waddling along a dotted line with a 400-pound metal pot between my legs. Am I of no use to society unless I can squat a platform of eight women dressed in bathing suits? The ghost of my former self haunts me still. ""Don't hurt yourself, Dad,"" my kids will say in a patronizing tone when I strap a refrigerator to my back and start pacing back and forth. They don't have to remind me I can't carry the ones with built-in freezers anymore. I know I can't, and it kills me. Every day I look in the mirror and see a shell of the World's Strongest Man I used to be'a man who made the audience pause when they saw how fast I could load the bed of a truck with 12 heavy barrels. Now folks just humor me and say, ""Good for you, Bill!"" when I lift a 700-pound ox wagon. And why should they be impressed? Only 700 pounds? My wife can lift that, and she's two years older than me. And it's only getting worse. The other day I had to go to the doctor, because during one of my speaking engagements, I threw out my back trying to pick up a child with my pinkie finger. Do you have any idea how embarrassing that was? I guess I don't know what I'm going to do with the rest of my life. There's nothing out there for a World's Strongest Man past his prime. I suppose I could travel, or take up gardening, but I'm afraid nothing will ever be as satisfying as competitively flipping over a giant tire, walking after it, flipping it again, walking after it, and flipping it again. Well, whatever I decide to do in my later years, I better do it quickly. After all, when you're an old World's Strongest geezer like I am, and you've taken a colossal amount of anabolic steroids, the old ticker could explode at any moment.","opinion, entertainment, sports year in review 2008, commentary, vol 44 issue 45, bill kazmaier, entertainment"

2906,Burned Lower Half Of Mort's Face Revealed In 'Bazooka Joe' Stunner,"NEW YORK'The world of bubblegum- related comics was forever changed Monday, when, after more than 50 years, the Bazooka Joe supporting character known as ""Mort"" finally revealed the lower half of his face to be a grotesque mask of third-degree burns. The eye-opening strip, unveiled earlier this week by the Topps Company, is being called the darkest, most compelling installment in the entire Bazooka Joe series. In the strip, a wisecracking Mort pulls down his trademark red turtleneck and, for the first time, exposes millions of readers to the jumbled mass of flesh and bone that lies beneath it. ""Readers will never look at Mort or, for that matter, any of the other Bazooka Joe characters the same way again,"" said noted bubblegum-art historian and author Phillip Weissenthal. ""This changes everything'Mort's relationship with Jane, the time he and Bazooka Joe went to the zoo together, his fervent dislike of Metaldude. It's a paradigmatic shift on a scale never before seen in bubblegum literature."" ""That face,"" Weissenthal continued. ""God, that scarred and blistered face."" According to sources at Topps, the shocking revelation represents five decades of careful planning on the part of the strip's many artists. Though initially concerned about unveiling Mort's scorched and deformed face to the public, all agreed that the time had come to show what had remained covered all these years. ""This was perhaps not what people expected from Bazooka Joe,"" said the strip's current art director Anthony Sheppard. ""It may not be pretty and it may not be easy to swallow, but it's the truth. This is Bazooka Joe. This is two square inches of real life."" Created in 1953 by World War II veterans Woody Gelman and Wesley Morse, Bazooka Joe was reportedly started as a way for its two creators to deal with the horrors they had witnessed while fighting overseas. ""Bazooka Joe has always been about mankind's search for meaning in a world marked by pain,"" said staff artist Martin Shore, who claimed that the idea for Mort first came to Gelman after he watched entire villages burn to the ground in the Philippines. ""Sure, the sight of Mort's charred and blackened jaw may shock some of our readers, but maybe they should be shocked. Maybe it's time they woke up and realized the true, unrelenting nightmare that is our very existence."" Added Shore, ""If they don't like it, they can buy another fruit-flavored gum."" A number of Bazooka Joe writers, some of whom have been with the comic since its inception, said that Gelman and Morse would be proud of the controversial strip were they still alive today. According to veteran gag-writer Henry Paluschi, the latest Bazooka Joe strip is a living testament to the spirit of the bubblegum comic. ""Why do you think it's called Bazooka Joe?"" said Paluschi, explaining that Morse named the strip in honor of Pvt. Joseph Weinek, who was blinded in his right eye by a surprise bazooka attack shortly before U.S. forces were overrun in the Battle of Mindanao. ""All this time'haven't you ever wondered what's beneath Bazooka's eyepatch?"" Paluschi continued. ""Well, I'll tell you. It's nothing. Nothing at all'just an empty, gaping mass of pus and scar tissue. A gaping hole, one as dark and bare and devoid of all hope as the future we face."" Though some have called the controversial comic strip ""inappropriate for the majority of its intended audience,"" others have praised the strip, heralding it as a profoundly moving and inspirational artistic risk. ""Seeing Mort reveal the source of his inner demons is what finally gave me the courage to stop pulling my own turtleneck over my face,"" said Ted Hyams, a cancer survivor who lost his lower jaw to the devastating disease. ""He is a symbol of that which enables us, at our best, to transcend man's inhumanity to man."" ""And also, you can win prizes, like a fun Bazooka Joe bobblehead figure, if you collect enough strips and mail them in,"" he added. Hyams' support is reflected by many within the creative world who have been affected by Bazooka Joe over the years. ""There are those who may be angered by the frankly disturbing imagery the Bazooka Joe comic strip is choosing to present,"" said Art Spiegelman, a Pulitzer Prize'winning artist and former Topps employee. ""But it's the job of all true art to challenge and subvert the assumptions of its audience, and to confront them with the brutal realities they may not otherwise want to see."" ""Hehe,"" Spiegelman continued. ""Face facts.""","entertainment, health, scandal, art, comics, news, vol 44 issue 44, entertainment"
2907,Supremes Court Upholds Stopping In The Name Of Love In 2-1 Decision,"WASHINGTON'After months of deliberation, the Supremes Court, the soulful judicial body that oversees federal matters of the heart, issued a historic decision in the case of Holland v. Baby, Baby, opting to uphold the practice of stopping in the name of love by a 2-1 vote. ""The court has given careful consideration to arguments from both sides, and tried so hard, hard to be patient,"" Justice Cindy Birdsong said in her well-choreographed majority decision. ""It is our opinion that stopping in the name of love is not only the compulsory duty of the philandering party, but it would be irresponsible for him to do otherwise, pursuant to the aforementioned instances in which we have been both good and sweet to you, as well as the imminent risk of breaking the court's heart."" Added Justice Birdsong, ""Think it o-o-ver."" This case marks the first challenge against the stopping-in-the-name-of-love doctrine first established more than 40 years ago by the Supremes Court, the nation's highest judicial trio, which presides over the federal government's Motown branch. The Supremes Court has set numerous anti-heartbreak precedents since that time, including the 1964 overturning of Georgia's breaking-up laws in favor of more lenient kissing/making-up statutes, and a 1966 decision that deemed unconstitutional the practice of hurrying love, which was determined to be in direct violation of what the court's mama said. Although some analysts speculated enough time had passed for the impartial, perfectly harmonized justices to get over it, with this near-unanimous decision, the court once again demonstrated a hard-line stance against messing around. Some critics have said that the latest ruling shows an unethical bias that could affect the court's upcoming decision in the case of the People of the State of California v. This Feeling Inside Me. ""We have concluded this matter is not just a simple abstraction,"" Justice Mary Wilson explained in a written statement. ""The language of the Constitution is unclear on the matter, but it is the court's belief that, had the framers known of your secluded nights, they would have done anything to prevent losing you forever. Including supporting a 28th amendment to force you to stop this infatuation. Ooo."" Assistant attorney Lamont Dozier, who spoke on behalf of romance-related halting, said he was overjoyed with the court's ruling. ""Today, the highest court of soul has spoken for every citizen who has ever had someone take their heart and leave them sad,"" Dozier told reporters. ""I must confess, I became so emotional when I heard them read the decision that I cried tears for those who had never felt the joy we felt and, for a moment, experienced an auditory hallucination of an orchestral performance."" While it was thought the court would hand down a unanimous ruling on the case, Chief Justice Diana Ross provided the sole dissenting opinion, saying that she could not endorse a blanket decision that did not take into consideration the varying degrees of love. ""As an individual, I emphatically support stopping in the name of love,"" Justice Ross said in her five-page written dissent. ""However, I believe it is a states' rights issue and should not be legislated from the highest offices. Additionally, it should be noted that the so-called 'love' referred to in this instance has already been wasted and, in fact, may have been nothing more than a handful of promises. Therefore, I believe it is imprudent to waste further tears on reflections of the way life used to be, reflections of the love you took from me."" Ross then returned to her private chambers without making eye contact with the other two justices. Justice Ross's written statement has fueled already existing speculation that she may be attempting to draw the court in a more Berry Gordian direction'one that would grant greater authority to the position of chief justice than is given to the Supremes Court as a whole'particularly following the abrupt departure of Justice Florence Ballard. Congress is expected to support the stopping-in-the-name-of-love ruling by passing a round of legislation first proposed by Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) last year when his wife was caught running around with the gardener.","entertainment, celebrities, relationships, music, legal, courts, justice, news, vol 44 issue 44, entertainment"

2914,"When Life Gets You Down, Sometimes You Just Have To Make 'D4: The Mighty Ducks' Yourself","Life is unfair. That's just a fact. But when you've got no money and no family and it's been three years since Hollywood offered you a role in a film, you've got to ask yourself, ""Am I going to sit here on the couch all day and wallow in self-pity, or am I going to get out there and make D4: The Mighty Ducks on my own?"" Well, for me, the answer is simple: The Quack Attack is back, Jack! Sure, I could wait for the studio to contact me. I could wait for the script for D4: Running Afowl to magically appear in my mailbox with a neat little bow on it. Or, I could brush these Sun Chips crumbs off my stomach, put on some pants, and do this thing! How hard can it be? All you need is some pluck, determination, a buddy with a camera, one of those long microphones they hold above you when you talk, a videotape, and a head full of good ideas. Ideas like that the Ducks are pro hockey players now and I'm the coach. Bingo bango bongo. Something the whole family can enjoy. Folks, the real message I'm trying to convey here is that we all face tough times. We all get stuck in a rut. We all contemplate slitting our wrists with the blade of the ice skate we wore in the original Mighty Ducks movie, released in 1992 to warm reviews. I know I've been there. But we have to rise above all that and keep calling Josh Jackson until he returns one of our voicemails, keep trying to figure out how to do a special effect that makes it look like a really fast slap shot burned a hole through the net and set it on fire. Because if we don't do that, I ask you, how are we ever going to get work again? Now, I've been kicking around D4 ideas for the past 12 years, and it's high time I start putting them out there, because they aren't doing any good rattling around in my head. I got this one idea that Coach Bombay (i.e. me) is skating on a frozen pond in slow motion, sort of reflecting on his life like he always does, and then the ice cracks and he falls in. For a second it looks like he's going to drown, but then you see someone extend this hockey stick into the ice-cold water, and the camera zooms up, and it's Charlie (i.e. Charlie Conway, my protégé). He saves me. He's old now and has a beard. And he says in this really gravelly voice ""Ducks fly together"" and I nod at him and then the team gets back together to play in the Olympics. Then ""Whoomp! (There It Is)"" starts playing. It's really all a metaphor for life and for saving people. But like I said, that's just one idea. I'm coming up with things all the time. Like the other day, I was doing some doodles of cartoon hockey players, like a pig who's a goaltender because he's fat. It got me thinking that D4 could be half animated, half live action. Like the movie Space Jam was. This could be like Space Jam, but it can be called Hockey Jam. I could be the Michael Jordan guy. I didn't get to where I am in life by sitting back and not making Mighty Ducks movies. And I'm sure as heck not going to stop now. I've just got to type up these scripts, and do some funny jokes and some cool new characters like a guy who can shoot a puck backwards through his legs. Also I have to find a budget somewhere, because movies need budgets. Then it's just a matter of picking up the phone and calling the old gang. I'm sure they'd be up for another sequel. Guys like Fulton, Lester, Jesse. I wish I knew their real names. Of course, if I can't get the original actors, am I going to whine and give up? No. When life gives you shit, you've got to turn that shit into D4: The Mighty Ducks: The Prequel. I've even got some great ideas for awesome new moves. You can't have a Mighty Ducks movie without having cool and funny ways to score goals. In the first one, we had the Flying V and the triple deke. Then in D2 we had the knuckle-puck. Well get ready for this, because this is going to blow you out of the water. Are you ready? Quadruple deke. That's four dekes! Like D4, get it? Four. The movie will hinge on this, because'spoiler alert!'it's the thing the players will do at the end to win the final game that it looked like they would not be able to win. So this cool move, or ""trick,"" will be an important part of D4. If anyone reading this has any equipment for making movies with, or is a movie executive, or would like to look over my script and give me some feedback, you can reach me at coach.bombay57@gmail.com. Wait, I just thought of another thing. We could have the Ducks face the terrorist's hockey team, and if we win, they have to stop being terrorists. That could not only be funny, but also symbolic.","opinion, entertainment, celebrities, commentary, vol 44 issue 43, emilio estevez, entertainment"

2917,900-Pound Giant Squid Joins Cast Of 'The View',"NEW YORK'The View, a daytime talk show featuring a panel of women who discuss current events and topical issues, has found its newest cohost'a 53-foot-long giant squid. 'We feel that the squid brings a fresh new point of view to the program,' said View executive producer and host Barbara Walters. 'We looked at hundreds of potential candidates, but in the end, this rare and exotic creature from the darkest depths of the sea truly stood out.' 'And as far as we can tell, it is a female,' Walters added. The 900-pound cephalopod from the family Architeuthidae joins cohosts Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, and Sherri Shepherd. Like many past hosts, who have come from such diverse backgrounds as law, stand-up comedy, and local news, the squid was a virtual unknown before joining the cast. Plucking it from relative obscurity, producers discovered the squid 26,000 feet below sea level in the Mariana Trench and said to themselves, 'This is the perspective the show has been lacking.' 'After the squid's years spent dwelling on the ocean floor, I think viewers will be interested to hear its take on the hustle and bustle lifestyle of New York City,' said ABC programming director Cyndi DeHart. 'And personally, I can't wait to see how the squid interacts with Whoopi. Watch out!' 'This sassy cephalopod takes no prisoners,' she added. In its debut on the show, the marine life form was very animated, thrashing wildly and whipping its clawed tentacles across the studio during a heated debate about the Iraq War. Since then, however, the squid has been quiet and largely motionless. Many critics say the squid's reserved nature provides the perfect contrast to the louder, more opinionated cohosts such as Goldberg, Behar, and Hasselbeck. According to fans of the show, the squid's most memorable moment thus far occurred last week, when it got a little testy during a discussion on whether teenage girls are getting 'too sexy too soon' and squirted 12 gallons of ink onto Sherri Shepherd. The antic was met with laughter and applause from the studio audience. 'That was the moment this squid became a star,' said View co-executive producer Bill Geddie, who has already booked the multi-tentacled mollusk on The Tonight Show and Live With Regis And Kelly, and has laid the groundwork on a deal for it to take over hosting duties of the syndicated version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire in 2010. In addition, the squid has already netted its own weekly segment on The View, 'The Giant Squid's Gourmet Corner,' which features quick and easy culinary tips for viewers at home. Fan reaction to the giant aquatic invertebrate has been mostly positive. A recent ABC poll claims that the squid is connecting well with housewives and single mothers over 35. 'I like the squid,' said Chicago resident Anna Herskowitz, 46. 'I really relate to it. More than I relate to Elisabeth Hasselbeck, anyway.' Some viewers, however, have complained that the squid is too conservative. During an interview last week with Republican presidential candidate John McCain, the squid sat silently sprawled across the center of the studio and didn't ask the senator a single hard-hitting question. 'That squid is there for one reason, and that's to push its right-wing conservative agenda,' Denver, CO viewer Mary Foley said. 'Come on, give us viewers a little credit here.' Critics have also noticed some tension between the squid and the rest of the cast. The squid has been known to start arguments with Behar by wrapping one of its 27-foot tentacles around Behar's torso, lifting her into the air, and drawing her toward its powerful beak. The producers, however, say that such spur-of-the-moment conflict is what makes The View what it is, and that the attack was not personal. In an interview last Friday, Behar voiced her support of the creature. 'We might argue on set'I might jokingly call the squid 'disgusting' or 'decomposing' or 'stupid,' and poke fun at its awful stench, and it might sometimes try to shred my body with its razor-sharp radula'but once the show is over, we're all friends,' Behar said. 'The squid even came to my daughter's piano recital.' According to a network insider, the squid is planning an emotional segment that will air next Wednesday in which it reveals that it has breast cancer.","entertainment, celebrities, tv, news, vol 44 issue 42, entertainment"

2922,Members Of Twisted Sister Now Willing To Take It,"NEW YORK'In a stunning reversal of their long-stated reluctance to take it, members of heavy-metal band Twisted Sister announced Monday that, after 24 years of fervent refusal, they are now willing to take it. ""I acknowledge that we promised not to take it anymore, but things change. The world is a different place today, and with that in mind, we would like to go on record as saying that, starting right now, we are going to take it,"" read a statement released by the band's lead singer, Dee Snider. ""To clarify, we would still prefer not to take it, but as of now, taking it is an option that we would be open to. That is all."" Bassist Mark ""the Animal"" Mendoza also stated that, in regards to what he wants to do with his life, he no longer solely wants to rock, but would instead prefer doing other things, such as raising a family and working as a claims adjuster in Rye, NY.","entertainment, celebrities, music, summer music, news in brief, vol 44 issue 40, entertainment"
2923,Bands Don't Ever All Get The Same Haircut Anymore,"There's nothing quite like a rock concert. I remember how exciting it was to sit in a packed stadium, watching four or five young men with indistinguishable haircuts run toward the stage and grab their instruments. And then, then they'd start playing'and boy I'll tell you, that's when those haircuts would really start moving. Swaying to and fro at equal lengths above their shoulders, shimmering in the same tones of brown, black, or blonde. That, my friends, was true rock and roll. But it just couldn't last. The kind of musical rebellion those uniformly mop-topped or bowl-cut or side-parted young men brought into our lives was a flame that burned too brightly. Gone are the days of the Beatles, the Partridge Family, the Monkees, the Who, and the Beatles during Sgt. Pepper, when they all grew matching mustaches. And, in place of those great, similarly hairstyled songsters we have'well, I don't quite know what to call them. A bunch of strangers with different haircuts. I wouldn't be surprised if the members of these so-called ""rock bands,"" with their wildly differing haircuts, aren't actually best friends who spend all their time together, laughing, smiling, and pulling innocent pranks, for crying out loud! EEThe last time I tried to go to what now passes for a ""ck concert,"" I was just plain confused. Was it a band I was watching? Or was it a collection of four random people who just happened to be standing near one another with instruments in front of thousands of screaming fans, singing the same lyrics? Can you even call it a song if it's performed by a group of people with such dramatically varying hair lengths? I paid $45 for this ticket, and they can't even buy matching hats. Having a different haircut for each band member is not only disorienting'it's completely insane. Hey, why don't we just let a horse play drums while we're at it? If the bass guitarist doesn't have the same hairdo as the guitarist, how am I supposed to know they aren't really two solo artists having a two-hour guitar battle? Maybe my straight-haired neighbor Cliff is in the band, too. Maybe I'm the lead singer! (I'm not, by the way.) But that's what these ridiculous, haphazard band hairstyles today would have you thinking. We need to get back to the days of being able to distinguish, by hairdo alone, who is part of a musical combo, and who is just a normal person going about his evening. I know there were some bands in the 1980s who at least made an effort to have matching long hair'I think ""Bands with the Long Hair"" is what they were called'but they were still all over the place with the different colors and curly versus not curly. Usually, I'd be hesitant to call them a band at all, but I'm grasping at straws here. If it weren't for my favorite 900-person African-American R&B; group, the MoTowns, I wouldn't have anything to listen to. The real tragedy is, the kids today don't know what they're missing. My daughter goes crazy for these kids, the Jonas Brothers, who she claims are the best band ever. But there's nothing band-like about them! One has straight hair, one has wavy hair, and as for the one that sings, well, he can't keep the same hairstyle for more than a month. No daughter of mine is going to listen to some pack of do-nothings who can't even visit the same barber before embarking on a sold-out tour. Why, just about the only thing that unifies them as a band is the fact that they're all homosexuals. Times sure have changed, for the worse, I guess. Hopefully the ""different haircuts"" fad of these last few decades of bands will fade, and we'll return to the glory days of music, when a band's drummer was only distinguished from the rest of the group by the trademark sunglasses he wore to disguise his identity while eluding mobs of screaming girls who would chase him down the street, forcing him to duck into an old-fashioned phone booth and pretend to make a telephone call. Until then, I guess I'll just satisfy myself with these old album covers.ss","opinion, entertainment, music, commentary, vol 44 issue 39, vernon boyd, entertainment"

2928,What Am I Going To Do With All These Dog Uteruses?,"Anyone who enjoyed my historic 35-year run as host of The Price Is Right knows there's no cause I feel more strongly about than the crisis of animal overpopulation. That's why I made sure to close every show by reminding viewers to have their pets spayed or neutered, and why I took that correspondence course on in-home animal surgery. But after four decades of personally removing as many dog uteruses as I could get my hands on, they're really starting to pile up. I've got dog uteruses everywhere. In the living room, dog uteruses. In the attic, dog uteruses. In the drawers of my night table, dog uteruses. In the vegetable crisper, dog uteruses. My study is so packed with dog uteruses, I can't even get in there to spay dogs anymore. Where am I supposed to store all of these things? Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining about the work of spaying these dogs myself, or even the smell of decomposing canine reproductive systems, which I've come to accept and, to some degree, even enjoy. It's really just the issue of space. I tried lofting my bed to make more room for them, I ordered some of those space-age vacuum-sealed storage bags and stuffed them full to bursting'heck, I even used a few dozen to edge my garden. I used to be proud of my house, but now it seems like everywhere you look, there's a giant pile of dog uteruses. I honestly don't even know how I've accumulated so many dog uteruses so fast. I guess it's like any other hobby: You start making model airplanes, then you have to build a special shelf to store them, then they start filling a bookcase, and before you know it, you've got a bloody, sopping-wet heap of dog uteruses in the trunk of your car. What's really sad is that I've gotten so used to these dog uteruses that they just seem like part of the decor at this point. Just the other day, I caught myself setting the mail down on the waist-high stack of dog uteruses in my foyer. Last week, I had guests over, and when one of them asked where the bathroom was, I told her to ""go down the hall, take a right at the third mound of discarded dog uteruses, and it's the second door on your left."" That's when you know you've got too many dog uteruses. Before I left The Price Is Right, I tried to warn the new boy they've got hosting the show about all of this. On my last day, I handed him the skinny microphone, looked him square in the eye, and said, ""Pretty soon, your whole basement is going to be swimming with dog uteruses."" He just looked at me like he didn't know what I was talking about, but he'll learn soon enough. Gee, I wonder how many dog uteruses I have at this point. Let's see, five dog hysterectomies a day, plus 20 on the weekends, times 52 weeks a year, times 37 years. That's whatEE90,000 dog uteruses? Wow, 90,000 dog uteruses. That's a lot. And that's not even counting all the cat uteruses. At the risk of sounding ungrateful, I'd like to be able to use my dining room again. But I can't.

""Twenty-three times throughout the film, a crotch is kicked, punched, raked, shoveled, bitten, or hit with either a baseball bat, tennis racket, or nunchucks, but 20th Century Fox keeps invoking Hollywood's 'rule of 24,'"" said Friedberg. ""In their opinion, the film could use a second crotch-hitting joke right at the beginning to really set the tone. Aaron and I feel strongly that 23 crotch jokes is enough, and 24 would be overdoing it. But that's not to say we wouldn't be willing to compromise with the studio if necessary to bring our creative vision to the screen.""

""Who is going to care for my loved ones when I am gone?"" said the unemployed, unmarried Grossman, who also thinks he may have an enlarged prostate, and is wondering why he's been picking up his pet medication at the vet when he could have it delivered right to his door for just a small monthly fee. ""Isn't it about time I gave my family the peace of mind they deserve?""

2934,Report: More Television Viewers Becoming Desensitized To Drama,"LOS ANGELES'Researchers at the USC Center for the Study of Television announced Monday that a new report points toward a drastically impaired response to real-world dramatic incidents among America's habitual television viewers. ""We found that a majority of viewers who watch a normal amount of television'between 32 and 56 hours a week'were relatively unmoved by such personal traumas as divorce, financial disaster, or the death of a child, compared with their reactions to similar events on television,"" said Dr. Fernando Alonso, whose team conducted the study. ""Respondents consistently said that predicaments they'd seen play out on House were worse than their loved ones' bouts with emphysema, and that they had experienced greater rejection over unrequited love during Grey's Anatomy than they had in their own lives."" Alonso said the study, performed on adults over the age of 21, does not necessarily contradict an earlier report that found children who witnessed drama on TV were more likely to commit drama themselves.","entertainment, tv, news in brief, vol 44 issue 37, entertainment"

2939,Juicer Infomercial Sweeps Early Morning Emmys,"LOS ANGELES'Expectations were running high for Jack LaLanne's Power Juicer going into the 2008 Early Morning Emmys, the annual award ceremony honoring television's finest programming between the hours of 3 a.m. and 6 a.m., but no one expected it to be so dominant. When the night was over, the paid program had netted itself a record 10 awards. The 15-minute juicer infomercial won every category in which it was nominated, taking home the gold-colored plastic trophies for Best Program, Best Infomercial, Best Writing, Best Casting For An Infomercial Or Televangelism Program, Most Economical Sound Editing, Most Kitchen Appliances Replaced By One Product, Most Special Offer, Most Convincing Testimonials, and Most Enthusiastic Announcer, as well as a Best Endorser win for LaLanne, his fifth. The night marked the first-ever win for the spot, which began airing in 2003 but had never previously been nominated. ""This is the kind of special evening that makes a career in As-Seen-On-TV products worthwhile,"" said Keith Mirchandani, CEO of Tristar Products, the company that manufactures the juicer. ""But truly, it was an honor just to be nominated alongside the Total Gym."" Mirchandani then graciously thanked the Academy of Early Morning Television by eliminating one payment and throwing in a recipe guide absolutely free. The 14th Annual Early Morning Emmy Awards kicked off at 2 p.m. Monday in their most luxurious fashion ever. The ceremony was held in the beautiful Auxiliary Ballroom C of the Marriott LAX, located right in the heart of the area surrounding Los Angeles International Airport. VIP guests dined on beef jerky, dehydrated pineapple, and juicy, no-fuss rotisserie chicken catered by Ron Popeil and company. The filmed event was broadcast at 1 a.m. on the ION television network, formerly known as PAX TV. ""This is early morning TV's biggest afternoon,"" said the event's celebrity host, Donny Osmond, during his introduction. ""The stars have all come out in their Bedazzled finest to celebrate this year's most exceptional work in informational product-driven features and syndicated entertainment."" ""I just saw Tom Bosley at the buffet,"" Osmond added. ""He must be excited about his chances for a Best Actor win. I thought his work on the Season 2 reruns of Murder, She Wrote was outstanding again this year."" In perhaps the ceremony's most poignant moment, a tearful Kevin Trudeau, fresh from losing another Federal Trade Commission lawsuit, accepted a lifetime achievement award and announced the release of his new book, The Speed Reading Secrets ""They"" Don't Want You To Know About. The juicer's multiple wins were especially surprising considering that previous juicer nominees, including the Jack LaLanne' endorsed Juice Tiger in 1993, had all been snubbed. Many critics had said it was impossible for a juicer to win in the top categories, especially when competing against acne cream and fitness equipment infomercials, which are often viewed as more serious works. Though Jack LaLanne's Power Juicer made winning look easy as the afternoon went on, the infomercial faced stiff competition in nearly every category. Many thought the Magic Bullet To Go infomercial, which saw the return of all the stars from the original critically acclaimed Early Morning Emmy'winning Magic Bullet infomercial, would take home wins in a category or two. But the portable Bullet only managed to walk away with one statue for Best Vaguely British Or Australian Accent. Also nominated against the juicer were the Little Giant Ladder, Orange Glo cleaner, the Oreck Air Purifier, Slim 'n Lift, Wizetrade, and the Mr. T'endorsed Flavor Wave Oven. According to Nielsen Media Research, the broadcast of the star-studded event attracted 25,000 viewers, the same number it draws every year. ""The [Jack LaLanne Juicer ad] is a modern early-morning classic and it deserved to win,"" said home viewer and insomniac Alex Guerra, who watched the ceremony while pacing back and forth in his den. ""LaLanne and his wife give performances you could only see from a Billy Mays or Tony Little in their prime."" ""With all the montages and added awards and product demonstrations they did this year, though, it lasted almost six hours,"" Guerra continued. ""Thank God. I thought I would have to watch Weird Science again."" Other notable 2008 winners included Loretta Swit for Best Actress in M*A*S*H; Cocoon for Best Film; Best Television Series Maximum Exposure; Jack Van Impe for Best Televangelist; and, receiving an award for lifetime achievement, the blue color bar used when stations go off air. In what was perhaps the ceremony's most emotional moment, Brandy Norwood of Moesha made history when she became the first non-televangelist African-American to win an Early Morning Emmy. About a third of all statues were awarded posthumously.","entertainment, celebrities, food, products, tv, television, news, vol 44 issue 35, entertainment"

2945,"Darling, There's Something I've Been Hiding From You'I'm Jimmy Buffett","Darling, I know we've been together for over 30 years, and we've always promised that we would never keep any secrets from each other. But I think you should brace yourself, because, well, there is one thing I haven't been completely honest about: I'm Jimmy Buffett. Please don't be mad! I know that for all these years you thought I was ""Jimmy Buffett the boat salesman who had to travel a lot for work."" But no. I am Jimmy Buffett the multiplatinum recording artist known for such songs as ""Margaritaville"" and ""Son Of A Son Of A Sailor."" It's not something I'm very proud of, but it pays the bills. I understand it's a lot to take in right now, but it's true. Your husband and the father of your children wrote and recorded the song ""Cheeseburger In Paradise."" I actually wrote the lyrics to it the night we met. I understand if you never want to speak to me again. It's been tearing me up inside, lying to you like this. I can't stand all the sneaking around, so as much as it pains me, I must reveal the awful truth. Last night when I told you I was going to run to the store for a second, I actually flew down to Miami and performed in front of 45,000 people for my Year of Still Here Tour. Also, that Country Music Award on my dresser? That wasn't a gag gift like I said. That is real. And I didn't save up for your diamond engagement ring by taking extra shifts at the marina. Something called ""Pencil Thin Mustache"" bought that ring. It's a song about a guy who wants a pencil thin mustache. Jesus Christ, what have I done? And all those times I told you that I was ""going to the Jimmy Buffett concert""? Well, I wasn't attending those concerts, I was standing on stage singing songs for thousands of screaming fans. Yes, the very same people who come up to me on the street and tell me how much they love me. They're calledEEthey're called Parrotheads and I'm sorry! Please, don't let this change the way you think of me. I'm still the same guy I've always been, except that I don't actually sell boats, and occasionally I yell to thousands of people to ""t your fins up"" and then they wave their hands around above their heads and pretend they're sharks. If it's any consolation, I'm also a bestselling author. That's not so bad, right? My newest novel is called Swine Not? and on the cover there's a picture of me in a hammock next to a pig, andEE. Oh God, you know what, just forget I ever mentioned that. I didn't want you to ever have to find out about this, but I knew you were starting to get suspicious. Especially the other night, when we were watching TV and the A&E; Biography on Jimmy Buffett came on, and he looked exactly like me, and then they showed a picture of the two of us together while they were talking about his family life. I tried to throw you off the trail by accusing you of having an affair with Jimmy Buffett the singer, but deep down, I knew it was time to come clean. ""Pirate Looks At Forty,"" ""Why Don't We Get Drunk (And Screw),"" ""Jamaica Mistaica""'all me. Every single one of them. That was me. I'm sure this probably explains a lot, like how we're able to eat for free twice a day, every day at the Margaritaville Café. Also, the reason I don't let you into the garage and scream at you if you even go near the door is because it's not really a garage, it's a $4 million recording studio. And it's tropical- themed. You know our friend Greg Taylor who I always call ""Fingers"" and who is always carrying around a harmonica? Well, he's Fingers Taylor, the guy who plays the harmonica in my backup band, theEEugh, the Coral Reefers. I know, it sounds stupid! It all sounds so stupid, but it's my life! I still don't know how you didn't figure out my horrible secret last year when we were at that Alan Jackson concert together and he pulled me up on stage. Remember? See, I wasn't doing Jimmy Buffett cover songs for karaoke, I was actually being Jimmy Buffett because I am him, and I was performing songs that I wrote, sometimes right when you were in the next room with the kids. Oh my God, the kids! They must never find out..Ltt","opinion, entertainment, celebrities, music, summer music, commentary, vol 44 issue 34, jimmy buffett, entertainment"
2946,Soderbergh In The Park To Stage Production Of 'Ocean's Twelve',"NEW YORK'In what has become a summer ritual for thousands of New York City theatergoers, the Independent Soderbergh Company will return to Central Park's Delacorte Theater this month to stage another free production of one of the Great Bergh's famed works. Coming off the success of last summer's open-air performance of the crowd-friendly Erin Brockovich, the ISC has gone with an admittedly unorthodox choice this year, deciding on Steven Soderbergh's 21st-century comedy Ocean's Twelve. Although it is widely considered one of Soderbergh's minor works, ISC creative director Kara Fletcher defended the selection, claiming that there is something to be learned from all of Soderbergh's pieces. ""The mission of Soderbergh in the Park has always been to bring Soderbergh to the masses,"" Fletcher said. ""And that includes even his more inaccessible material. Those who are skeptical will be pleased to find that many of the traditional Soderberghian themes are present in Ocean's Twelve: anger, betrayal, despair, the travails of cool wealthy people who plan crime capers, and brotherhood."" The ISC's production of Ocean's Twelve, which opens tonight and runs through Aug. 28, stars Patrick Stewart as the suave Danny Ocean and Kevin Kline as his main cohort, Rusty. Claire Danes, who portrayed Erin Brockovich last year, returns to the outdoor stage as Danny's wife, Tess. The remainder of the cast will be rounded out by more than 100 New York theater regulars and nearly 150 extras, as well as Casey Affleck, who will reprise the role he played in the original production. According to Kline, even the most seasoned Soderberghian actors were nervous about tackling Ocean's Twelve. ""Soderbergh is never easy,"" Kline said. ""I remember when I first saw Ocean's Twelve. I didn't get why the jokes were funny, it was way too long, and the plot was so incomprehensible that I nearly walked out of the theater."" ""But since then, I have come to appreciate the scope of the piece,"" he added. ""Though I admit that even after extensive study, the ending still remains a mystery to me."" The play also presents a challenge for director Steven Todd and set designer Molly Durang, as the script calls for quick scene changes that are both out of chronological order and set in multiple exotic locations, including Monaco, Paris, Rome, Chicago, and Los Angeles. In addition, Todd promised that the house-lifting sequence'in which the characters lift a mansion two inches off the ground by inserting compressed air into the foundation via a submarine'will remain true to the original. ""I am also happy to report that our props department has created a perfectly detailed hologram of a golden egg,"" Durang said. Debuting with a free showing of Sex, Lies, And Videotape in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park in 1997, Soderbergh in the Park has since become an American institution. This summer alone will see nine classic works of Soderbergh produced at more than 200 outdoor theaters across the nation, as an estimated 3 million theatergoers lay out blankets, sip some wine, and watch Full Frontal, Out Of Sight, and The Good German under the stars. ""For many people, the park is where they are first exposed to Soderbergh,"" Fletcher said. ""The outdoor setting fosters a more accommodating atmosphere for those who, under more traditional circumstances, are unwilling to give Soderbergh a chance."" At press time, hundreds of people had already formed a line to receive their free tickets for tonight's show, including many high school and junior high students who will be studying Soderbergh in the upcoming academic year. ""I've started a few Soderbergh movies, but I can never get through them,"" 16-year-old Jennifer Martin said. ""The dialogue is hard to understand, and the stories are confusing. But I came out to the park last year and saw Solaris, and maybe it was the trees, the feeling of the summer breeze, or that they actually launched multiple women into space, but I thought it was pretty cool."" Added Martin: ""Nathan Lane was great.""","entertainment, celebrities, movies, culture, news, vol 44 issue 33, entertainment"
2947,Violence Must Only Be Used To Make Hundreds Of Millions Of Dollars,"Whenever I'm paid $200,000 to demonstrate my martial arts abilities and give a short speech to a gathering of young people, I always speak about the same thing: the epidemic of violence we see in our society today. Why do so many kids think using their fists is the answer to all of life's problems? Where do they get these ideas? That's why I'm using my status as the world's most famous martial arts movie star to teach children an important lesson. Never, ever take a fist to another person unless you're profiting handsomely from it. I was a child once, and I know what it's like to want to settle your differences with a fight. There were many times I dreamed about giving a swift roundhouse kick to the bullies who tormented me. And I could have, too. I was trained. Ready. But when I entered the Peking Opera School to learn kung fu, my master Yu Jim Yuen told me that the true warrior must never strike first. He must sit and wait'at least until he has secured a three-picture deal with Warner Bros. and has fully developed his persona as a highly marketable, family-friendly Bruce Lee. Only then can you justly throw a large jug to someone to catch and then kick them in the face, shattering the jug, and their face. I recall one bully who used to taunt me when I was growing up in Hong Kong. He would call me horrible names and try to egg me on, but I always stuck to my principles. ""My friend, I have no quarrel with you,"" I would say. ""I will not fight you unless I'm given $5 million up-front, 3 percent on the back end, and first rights to star in any sequels."" The bully would beat me soundly, of course, but there's a lesson here: Unless you're getting a good cut of the profits, you must turn the other cheek. If and only if the person fighting you is a trained martial artist or an actor, and only if you're on the set of your 12th blockbuster film and your performers' union is not on strike, only then should you grab hold of your enemy's arm, spin him and swing him around behind you to take out five other extras playing henchmen, slide down a tapestry, crash through a glass wall, quip a disarming one-liner, and finally set your sights on taking down the mafia boss character who is trying to turn your native village into a lucrative casino. Remember: The wise fighter knows that violence may only need to be used once in an entire lifetime, especially if you have a good agent and can make sure the studio is giving you at least what they're paying Chris Tucker. Using force should be avoided at all costs, so it is important to pursue all of your options when faced with an opponent. If they strike you in the stomach, try to talk it out. If they kick your chest, suggest taking some time apart to cool off before coming together to work through your differences. And if they have stolen a Ukrainian warhead, and you catch up to them at an abandoned warehouse, and they start throwing tables and chairs and anything in the vicinity at you, and the director has said, ""Action,"" consider grabbing a nearby stepladder, swinging it around your back, and roundhousing them all in the face with its legs before twirling it around your neck, throwing the ladder up in the air to land over the biggest guy, and'while he's disoriented'punching him through the rungs. At least, that is what has always worked for me. Sadly, I have seen many a young man fall victim to an obsession with his own power. This is why one must be always wary of self- serving thoughts. You may have a swift right hand and foot, and be able to knock your foe to the ground with just one punch, but what will you do when he rises up against you with three or four others? If you meditate on this, you will see the error. You have involved yourself in a group battle, and no one is filming it. You may have won the fight, but you have lost millions in box-office receipts, DVD sales, action-figure licensing deals, maybe even a very popular series of video games. There is no honor in violence that doesn't make $67 million its opening weekend. For now, I will leave you with this thought. If I have learned anything from my long and profitable career as a martial artist, it is that spitting a mouthful of industrial alcohol onto an opponent wielding a hot glass rod to make him catch on fire'even if it's being filmed for your smash hit, Drunken Master II'is wrong. You should save a move that good for later in your career, when you're an established name and can command a larger percentage of the box-office gross.","opinion, entertainment, movies, commentary, vol 44 issue 33, jackie chan, entertainment"

2950,Soundgarden Inadvertently Reunites At Area Cinnabon,"SEATTLE'Members of the popular 1990s grunge band Soundgarden shocked critics and fans alike Tuesday, appearing together publicly for the first time in more than a decade after accidentally running into one another at the Northgate Mall Cinnabon. The unplanned 15-minute reunion was the result of a number of unrelated events, including lead singer Chris Cornell stopping by the baked-goods franchise to buy a Caramel Pecanbon, drummer Matt Cameron taking a break from shopping at the nearby Banana Republic, bass player Ben Shepherd walking by and noticing his one-time bandmates in the food court, and former guitarist and Cinnabon daytime supervisor Kim Thayil working the 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. shift. According to those in attendance at the packed fast-food venue, the highlight of the incidental Soundgarden reunion came when the rockers reconciled their differences and teamed up for the first time in years to finish off an order of Cinnabon Stix. ""At first it was pretty awkward and none of them seemed like they were really into it,"" said Al Helbling, 30, a Northgate Mall Sam Goody employee and Soundgarden fan. ""But then the drummer comes in and right after that the bass player comes in, and it was like, 'Yes, Soundgarden is back.' It was so intense."" The former members of Soundgarden, who have not released an album together since 1996's Down On The Upside, reported that it was initially difficult to find common ground, but once they began exchanging ideas and riffing on which sugar-filled dessert they were going to order, the chemistry felt ""as strong as ever."" While Shepherd told reporters he enjoyed seeing his old bandmates, he admitted to experiencing some last-minute doubts about going through with the encounter. ""I got all the way there, but then I just didn't know if I could do it,"" Shepherd said. ""I had a huge lunch that day. And Cinnabon, that's some really sugary stuff, even if you have a sweet tooth like me."" Thayil, who joined the band shortly after it was formed in 1984, said some tension arose between himself and former front man Chris Cornell early on in the reunion, after Thayil scolded Cornell for entering the cinnamon-bun snack purveyor without a shirt. ""Honestly, I didn't even recognize Chris at first,"" Thayil said. ""All I saw was this bare-chested guy entering the store, and that's unacceptable in the food-service industry. I hate to be the enforcer, but just because we were in a band together doesn't mean I can allow him to create an unhygienic environment."" The heated situation was quickly settled, however, when Thayil offered Cornell a complimentary 12-oz. CarmeLatta Chill. In turn, the 44-year-old lead singer responded by serenading Thayil with a version of the group's hit song ""Black Hole Sun"" in which he replaced the titular phrase with the word ""Cinnabon."" Cornell, former singer for the now-defunct group Audioslave, then stuffed his pockets with napkins, saying he needed them for a later solo project. The two soon moved to a back table, where they joined Shepherd and drummer Matt Cameron, the latter of whom said he was overjoyed to see his old bandmates, since he had to ""kill some time"" before Pearl Jam practice. Although Tuesday marked the first time the group has fully reunited, the members of Soundgarden have had a few near-misses in the past 10 years. In August 2000, all four members were seen entering Seattle-area Arby's restaurants, but the reunion never materialized: Cornell and Cameron visited the Meridian Avenue location, while Thayil and Shepherd decided to visit the Michigan Street franchise. The afternoon did, however, mark the largest Temple of the Dog reunion to date, when Cornell and Cameron ran into the rest of the supergroup's members in the restroom. After the success of the Cinnabon reunion, Soundgarden is reportedly planning a tour of the Sunglass Hut and Piercing Pagoda.","entertainment, celebrities, food, music, culture, shopping, summer music, news, vol 44 issue 32, entertainment"

2952,Everybody On Television Needs To Stop Talking So Loud,"I'm going to get right to the point, because hemming and hawing and being polite has gotten me nowhere. The people on television need to stop shouting at the tops of their lungs and start talking at a much lower volume. It's that simple. I've asked them to quiet down over and over for the past 15 years, but they don't listen to me. They probably can't even hear me over all their yelling. Why do they think they need to talk so loud? I'm sitting right here on the couch three feet away! There's no need to shout. I'm not deaf. Just talk to me in a normal tone of voice like I'm a normal human being. That's the way I talk to people'at a nice, respectful level. Ask anyone if Bob Denino shouts at folks when they're directly in front of his face and they'll tell you that he doesn't do that. Even as I'm writing this, they're shouting. Yak yak yak. There's just no stopping them. SHUT UP! STOP YELLING! PLEASE STOP ALL YOUR YELLING! They're still going. My neighbors are always complaining, telling me to keep it down and to knock off the racket. Me? It's the people on TV making all the noise! My neighbors have televisions. They know what the people on there are like. Screaming all day and all night. They just never'hold on one secEf. Pipe down in there! You're going to wake up the whole block! These people, I swear. You can't be rational with them. I wish there were a way to make them talk a few decibels softer. I've done everything I possibly can. I've shushed them, I've threatened to call the police, I even picked up the remote control one day and threw it at the television screen. They just kept right on yapping. It's not like I'm some 85-year-old man with big old hearing aids'I hear fine. Sure, I miss a word or two when I'm on the phone trying to order food, but it's because the people on the television are talking so loud that I can't even hear myself speak.

2961,"You're Never Too Old For Laser Tag vs. Sir, If You're Not Accompanying A Minor I'm Going To Have To Ask You To Leave","When I walk into the office on Monday, the guys always ask me what I did over the weekend, and my answer is always the same: I played laser tag! Laser tag is a fun game of strategy, quick thinking, and constant action. When I was younger, I used to spend hours playing tag with my friends'but this game of ""tag"" is not just for kids. Adults can have a great time playing it too! Whether you're 7 or 107, laser tag is the best! Okay, everybody enjoys playing sports, right? Well, laser tag is just another kind of sport, except better! Laser tag gives you all the thrills of competition with none of the contact. Plus, it's great exercise, and the simulated ""warfare"" gives you a huge adrenaline rush. You can have fun playing laser tag at any skill level, whether you just started or you've been playing for 20 years. It may just be the best sport on earth. I certainly think so! In a lot of ways, laser tag is like a game of cowboys and Indians set in the future. Remember how much fun you had playing that game? Well, who said you had to stop? Being an adult doesn't mean you have to give up the stuff you love! In fact, I'd go so far as to say laser tag is an improvement on cowboys and Indians, because with laser tag you've got the computerized sensor system, so there's no debate over whether someone has ""hit"" you. Just imagine if we had had that kind of technology when we were kids! ZAP! Now, I know some people are opposed to laser tag because they think it promotes violence. But to all those sticks in the mud I always say, ""And what's football, then? Athletic hugging?"" Come on! I think it's pretty difficult to confuse a laser gun with a real gun, even for kids. Maybe one day we'll be shooting lasers at aliens out in space, but for right now, it's just good clean fun for every age! And anyway, the lasers used in laser tag are real low-grade, so you don't have to worry about hurting your eyes. Take my advice: Get a big group of friends or coworkers together, head down to your local laser tag arena, and get ready to have the most fun you've ever had in your life. I don't think there's anything in the world like the thrill of playing laser tag. It's like being on another planet or in some video game, except this is not a video game'it's the real thing! Just make sure you've cleared your afternoon, because once you're suited up, you're not going to want to leave! Trust me, as soon as you fire your first laser gun, you'll wonder why you ever stopped playing tag. So just let go and allow yourself to have a great time. After all, why should kids get to have all the fun? Excuse me, sir? Could you step into the hall, please? Thank you. We've received some complaints from the other parents about your behavior in the arena, and it has come to my attention that you may not be here with a child. Sir, I'm going to need you to stop watching the game for a minute and look at me. I'm afraid that the rules are clear and as it is our policy here at LaserAdventure to provide fun family entertainment to players 7 years and older, unless you are here with your son or daughter, I'm going to have to ask you to turn over your gun and sensor pack. No, sir, I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to let you ""get back out there"" unless it is to accompany a minor. But if you'd prefer it, I could have my manager speak to you about our Player's Code, which you signed on the way in here. As you can see on the banner above me, we here at LaserAdventure always put fun first and the fun at LaserAdventure is simply contagious. It is our goal to give everyone the best experience possible, which is why we do not allow aggressive or ""professional"" play in the main arena. Sir, please stop pointing your gun at me. I've already deactivated it, and I'm not wearing a laser sensor. If you don't stop, I will be forced to have you escorted off the premises by mall security. I am not an ""enemy combatant,"" nor do I have any idea who this ""they"" is you seem to think has sent me, unless you're talking about the team of 8-year-olds from the Hannah Montana birthday party you've been picking off from atop the refueling station for the past half hour. And yes, before you say anything, I admit, there is nothing explicitly written in the Player's Code that prevents a man in his mid-30s from playing laser tag at 1 p.m. on a Wednesday against no one but middle schoolers, but frankly, sir, it's never been an issue before. Most of the adults who come in here just stand on the sidelines in case the children need them. We also traditionally allow players to pick their own names, although I'm sure you'll agree that choosing ""Blood_Shall_Run"" was a less than appropriate selection given the circumstances. Also, the release you signed before playing makes you financially responsible for any damage you cause, and I'm fairly certain the pee-wee baseball team you were playing with didn't get the idea to kick out the black lights in the corner and start a POW camp on their own. Yes, sir, I agree with you that ""war is hell,"" but may I remind you that offensive language and threats directed to either the LaserAdventure staff or the parents of players, even those whose children you do not feel are pulling their weight, are not permitted at any time within the establishment? I understand you were just having fun, but since you are clearly unable to follow the rules and regulations of LaserAdventure, I'm going to have to ask you to vacate the premises immediately. Fine, sir. You are more than welcome to come back next time ""with a real gun"" and see if we listen to you any more closely then, but I can assure you we won't. Good day, sir.","entertainment, point/counterpoint, vol 44 issue 30, will gallant, alex hart, laseradventure mission commander, entertainment"

2969,Steven Tyler Laid Off From Aerosmith As Band's Jobless Rate Hits 20%,"BOSTON'After years of relative stability, the Aerosmith unemployment rate soared to an all-time high of 20 percent Monday following the downsizing of the band's vocal sector, Steven Tyler. The announcement of the largest-ever round of Aerosmith layoffs sent shock waves throughout the group, but band leaders said that four decades of perfect employment was ""unrealistic"" and that it was necessary to shed some of the graying, outmoded workforce. ""Explaining to a longtime Aerosmith employee that his or her job is being eliminated is one of the most difficult challenges we face in this business,"" Aerosmith manager Trudy Green said in a statement released this morning. ""We thank Steven for his many years of loyal service, and wish him the best of luck in all his future endeavors."" Analysts speculate that the sector-wide layoff was a result of multiple factors, including redundancies in the singing-songwriting division, rising rehab fees that have cost the group millions, and a 34 percent decline in jump-kicks since 2003. In addition, some of Aerosmith's younger, more ambitious employees, such as Joe Perry, 57, are willing to sing and play an instrument at the same time, often for half the salary. ""Tying a scarf to a microphone stand is unfortunately no longer a marketable skill,"" IndustryWeek editor David Blanchard said. ""To compete in today's job market, you need to diversify your skill set. Someone who can not only sing, but also play tambourine and haul heavy equipment, is infinitely more valuable to a company."" Aerosmith, whose unemployment rate has held steady at 0 percent since the start-up rock outfit went public in 1970, recently underwent a paradigm shift away from what many deemed an antiquated business model. In the early 2000s, Aerosmith stopped manufacturing hits and instead began to focus primarily on repackaging and redistributing its existing product. This, Green said, made Tyler dispensable. Tyler was reportedly informed of the decision 45 minutes before the band was scheduled to go onstage for a performance, and was told to pack up his belongings and turn in his Aerosmith ""wings"" pin before the audience arrived. ""Thirty-eight years of work, and this is the thanks I get?"" said Tyler, who was set to retire in just 18 months. ""It's embarrassing. When [guitarist] Ray [Tabano] left back in '71, we all got treated to a nice dinner and some cake on his last day. And he was only in the band for five months."" ""The only reason I came on with Aerosmith in the first place was the job security,"" added Tyler, who said that after nearly 40 years of waking up at 5 p.m. sharp and going to work, he won't know what to do with himself when unemployed. ""And I liked being able to come in wearing an unbuttoned leather shirt and a leopard-print cowboy hat. Where else am I going to find a job like that?"" Morale among the remaining Aerosmith employees, Tyler's coworkers said, is low. ""I'm going to miss Steven,"" said rhythm guitarist Brad Whitford. ""He was a good guy, and, I don't know, I thought he sang pretty well."" This cost-cutting personnel change is Aerosmith's most radical shift in economic model since the band's experiments as a drug-trafficking cartel from 1978 to 1984, their brief 1986 merger with Run-DMC, and their short-lived 1994 attempt to switch over to fabricating microchips. ""This restructuring is exactly what Aerosmith needs right now,"" said Justin Levine, an analyst at Lehman Brothers. ""Frankly, they've been in brand decline since that Super Bowl halftime show with Britney Spears."" ""Everyone was hurt badly in the big 1998 Armageddon Bubble,"" said Bill Griffeth, host of CNBC's Power Lunch. ""At that point, practically everyone'even members of the younger generation'bought into Aerosmith, but it was clear that they would not be able to sustain that level of global interest. In truth, purchasing any of their material since Get A Grip has involved a substantial level of risk."" Tyler is not the only one in the industry to be affected by the recent recession. In January, Bad Company was outsourced to China, and just last week, Don Henley of the Eagles was replaced by a drum machine.","entertainment, economy, music, news, vol 44 issue 28, entertainment"

""Unfortunately, the program lacked the petty and reprehensible acts that demean all humanity and make for good, compelling television."" Dauman added that VH1 would consider bringing the show back if Knight were to become so distraught by the cancellation that he had to be hospitalized for an unsuccessful suicide attempt.","entertainment, music, tv, news in brief, vol 44 issue 25, entertainment"

""Due to what can only be described as gross incompetence, this poorly placed advertising block left us with little option but to sit through the commercials in their entirety so that we would not miss any part of the show when it returned,"" the statement read in part. ""We sincerely hope this unfortunate incident is not repeated, especially right before we find out whether or not contestants on our favorite game shows are going to win big money."" TV viewers last mobilized in December, when a late-night program that at first appeared to be a television talk show was later revealed to be a 27-minute-long advertisement for a juicer.","entertainment, television, news in brief, vol 44 issue 24, entertainment"

""This is the first work to integrate the elements of Caroline's writing block, her friends' efforts to cheer her up, and her constant need to find a husband.""

2980,"Now That I've Learned About Foreshadowing, I'm Going To Use It In All Of My Stories","Guess what? There is this really neat literary device I just learned about, and it's called ""foreshadowing."" It's this thing where, in the beginning of the story, you put in all these little ""hints"" about stuff that's going to happen later on. I can't wait to try it out! I think the best part about foreshadowing is that it doesn't come right out and tell everyone what's going to happen. Instead, it does this thing called ""planting a seed"" in the reader's mind, so that the ending will still be a surprise but also seem logical. At least that's what it said on WritersZone.com, which is a really good site with lots of fun tips on writing. Foreshadowing is awesome. You can foreshadow anything. One thing you can foreshadow is a high-powered attorney billing the hours, making the money, and rushing relentlessly up the corporate ladder of a giant D.C. law firm, and then in an instant, it all comes undone. I am definitely going to try foreshadowing that. Another thing I like is that you can put foreshadows in anywhere: in the dialogue, in the descriptions, even in the rising action. I suppose you could even plot out the whole story arc ahead of time, before you start writing, and put in the hints as you go along. Usually I just sit down and start typing, and then come up with a climax when I get to 450 pages. I wish I had learned about this foreshadowing technique earlier. Like, in the beginning of The Partner'this story I wrote about a junior attorney who pulls off the white-collar crime of the century'I could have put in some ""clues"" that the guy's lover is greedy or evil. That would have ""foreshadowed"" the end where she steals all his money. That would've been so cool! Foreshadowing also builds suspense. I used to think the only way you could build suspense was with rising action. Or maybe with the climax. But with foreshadowing, you can ""build expectations"" that make the reader want to keep reading to find out what's being foreshadowed. Now I think foreshadowing is the coolest way to hold the reader's attention. There is also something called a ""red herring,"" which is another thing I just found out about, which is like foreshadowing except the thing you foreshadow doesn't happen. A red herring is like a trick. I don't think I want to use a red herring. Going back to foreshadowing, you can foreshadow in a bunch of different ways. You could have a character say something that foreshadows something else, or you could use events to foreshadow later events. I think my favorite way is using a single word with two different meanings to foreshadow. For example, I learned that if a notorious D.C. power broker who knows a secret that goes to the top of the U.S. government is going to die, it's better to have him say ""I'd rather die than go to prison"" than something like ""I would never want to go to prison."" Because the first way has the word ""die"" in it, and then he does die. Foreshadowing is so much better than rising action. I was talking to my friends James Patterson and Patricia Cornwell the other day, and they told me about this new thing called ""symbolism,"" where you make one object ""represent"" another more ""abstract"" concept. Like, in my new story about a brash young attorney straight out of Harvard Law who's standing on the brink of a brilliant career and risks it all for a death-row convict and an impossible case, I could make the inmate's scar stand for something. It could stand for the judicial system, or for peace. In fact, depending on the way I ""describe"" it, I could make it stand for just about anything. This is all so exciting. I'm going to go write a new story right now!

2981,MTV Movie Awards Snubs Director Jonas Mekas Yet Again,"LOS ANGELES'Eighty-five-year-old Lithuanian avant-garde filmmaker Jonas Mekas, director of more than 50 movies including Zefiro Torna and the five-hour diary film As I Was Moving Ahead, Occasionally I Saw Brief Glimpses Of Beauty, was again overlooked by the MTV Movie Awards Sunday. This marks the 17th straight year in which Mekas, known for his signature single-frame style and a penchant for interrupting scenes with several seconds of black space, has failed to join the pantheon of such past winners as Lindsay Lohan, Jon Heder, and Chewbacca. ""It is a travesty that Mekas' stark vision of elegiac melancholia has not been rewarded with the coveted Golden Popcorn statue,"" Boston University film studies professor Ray Carney said. ""His [1997] film Letter From Nowhere'Laiskas Is Niekur No. 1 should have easily walked away with Best On-Screen Duo, or Best Kiss, or at least Best Ass.""

2987,"San Diego Zoo, Prison Merge","SAN DIEGO'Plagued by a lack of funding and growing staff shortages, the San Diego Zoo and Ironwood State Prison were combined earlier this week, bringing local inmates and wildlife together for the first time under the same roof. The new state-of-the-art facility'which will house 12 separate cell blocks, a reptile house, two weight rooms, and a primate sanctuary'is expected to save the state of California up to $5 million in operation costs over the next year. ""It is with great pride that I announce the opening of the San Diego Maximum Security Zoological & Convict Reserve,"" director David Hennessey said at an opening ceremony Tuesday. ""From southern white rhinos to repeat offenders serving 20 years for drug trafficking'you'll find them all here at our amazing new facility."" Construction on the resource-sharing project concluded last Wednesday, after which felons and fauna were carefully transferred to their new joint living space. According to Hennessey, the 40-acre facility features one of the largest collections of migratory birds, hoofed mammals, and hardened inmates in all of North America. ""This is, without a doubt, the only facility of its kind,"" said warden Jeff Thurston, noting the zoo-prison's authentic natural environments and thick bullet-proof glass. ""At any given time, visitors may be able to spot as many as three parole violators and up to five adult black bears in the same holding cell. During scheduled feedings, that number may be even higher."" The San Diego complex is open to schoolchildren on field trips, family members of convicted felons and state-appointed defense lawyers, and is expected to help boost the city's struggling tourism industry. Thurston said that visitors have so far responded favorably to the new facility, with many citing the ""Emperor Penguin And Death Row"" exhibit as their personal favorite. The complex will reportedly also feature a number of ""Scared Straight"" talks each week, during which young visitors will simultaneously learn about the dangers of breaking the law, as well as what happens when a male lowland gorilla suddenly feels threatened. ""I got to see the little baby pandas, and the monkeys, and the zebras,"" said 8-year-old Michael Nayman, who was taken by his mother to the part-zoo, part-prison compound. ""And then I went and saw Daddy. But he wasn't as much fun as the pandas. He just sat in his cage and cried a little."" Despite a positive opening day, officials admitted that the San Diego facility has experienced a number of setbacks. On Tuesday, a scuffle in the shared cafeteria forced officials to fire a series of elephant-tranquilizer shots, leaving three inmates unconscious for days. In addition, a red-tailed Indonesian peacock was found stabbed to death on Thursday, after a group of prisoners accused the three-foot-tall bird of flashing colors of a rival gang in their direction. ""We've been forced to expand our infirmary unit nearly tenfold in the last week,"" chief nurse Margaret Hodge said. ""Unfortunately, the arrival of rhinoceros mating season has made things worse, leading to the gruesome deaths of almost 50 inmates in our communal showers."" According to officials, the institution has also suffered from three recent breakout attempts, including an ill-fated effort last Friday by Enrique Gonzalez, 36, to scale a reticulated giraffe up and over the compound's barbed-wire perimeter fencing. In addition, a 280-pound Bengal tiger was accidentally granted parole after its file was confused with that of mail-fraud convict Cole Bucholz, 47. Since the merger, officials at San Diego Zoological & Convict Reserve have received a record 600 requests from inmates wishing to be transferred to another maximum-security facility. In addition, officials have received 20 requests from inmates begging to have the dates of their execution pushed forward. ""I've been in a number of prisons in my life, but nothing compares to this,"" said inmate Casey Ingersoll, who despite previously committing violent murders was still horrified after witnessing a fellow convict ambushed by three Komodo dragons. ""If I stay here much longer, I'll have to join up with either the Anteaters or White Supremacists for protection."" While many local residents support the new facility, particularly due to the large number of jobs it has created, some have recently spoken out against the Zoological & Convict Reserve. ""To see all those poor souls forced to live in confined living quarters, with little to no sunlight, and no hope of freedom, it's just so inhumane,"" San Diego housewife Carol Wurster said. ""Those otters deserve better."" The San Diego Zoological & Convict Reserve's formation has been the most controvercial merger since Orlando's SeaWorld and the Ryan E. Puttnam Mental Asylum were hastily consolidated earlier this year.","entertainment, animals, news, vol 44 issue 20, entertainment"

2991,I Can't Believe I'm Being Forced To Sit On This Couch While Jay Leno Interviews Josh Hartnett,"Don't get me wrong: It's great being on the show. Love Jay, love the audience, really. And this JoshfHartnett, is it? He seems like a good kid. Reminds me a little of myself before I hit it big. I honestly think it's great to see him up there telling Jay how 'weird' it was to do his first sex scene and all, but I'm just a bit worried that some people might be a little put off by the fact that I am asked to 'scoot over' while Jay Leno interviews someone else. I know, I can hardly believe it myself. Believe me. I will move over. Always do. I'm a professional actor, after all, so I'm accustomed to adapting to strange and completely unbelievable situations. Remember the time on ER when I saved that boy who was trapped in a flash flood while the local news crews filmed the daring rescue? If I could make that look realistic, it should be a piece of cake to convince 11 million viewers that I flew in from Italy just to sit quietly off camera and listen to Josh Hartnett tell stories'none of which involve cowriting the critically acclaimed Good Night, And Good Luck, mind you. Look, I'm just happy that I got to show the audience a clip of a movie I directed and starred in, Leatherheads, and chat for a few with Jay about how 'sophisticated' my performance was in Michael Clayton, which left theaters less than eight weeks ago. To even have the opportunity to get up there is absolutely amazing, and I still can't get over the fact that so many people seem to think I'm good at what I do. Once again, though'no offense to Josh here'I can only lean casually into frame and deliver one of my disarming and self-effacing asides so many times before it gets a little, well, not cool. I know asking the guest to 'stick around' is tradition, but so was curing baldness with leeches until someone realized it didn't make any sense at all. Let's just analyze this logically. Over there, you have Jay Leno, who doesn't break eye contact with me the whole time I'm there, despite the fact that he's supposed to be asking Josh Hartnett if he's got any pets. Next, we have Josh Hartnett, who not only has to follow the crackling excitement over ","opinion, entertainment, george clooney, celebrities, commentary, vol 44 issue 20, entertainment"

2993,Michel Gondry Entertained For Days By New Cardboard Box,"NEW YORK'Director Michel Gondry has spent nearly a week developing his latest flight of artistic fancy by playing make-believe in a large corrugated cardboard box, sources close to the daring filmmaker announced Tuesday. The 45-year-old Gondry, who directed the critically acclaimed films Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind and Be Kind Rewind, reportedly dragged the washing-machine box into the foyer of his $2.1 million Upper West Side apartment after it was discarded by a neighbor Saturday morning. Using only a crayon and his imagination, Gondry was able to effortlessly transform the box into a submarine, a spaceship, and a castle. He also reportedly turned the box into a super-secret fort. ""This particular medium is wonderful to work in because of its limitless possibility,"" Gondry said from his curled-up position inside the box. ""I'm working at the bubble factory right now, but later I'm going to go bobsledding down a rainbow."" Gondry's latest project has already garnered a great deal of interest among Hollywood insiders. Although the former music-video director has thus far only invited Science Of Sleep actress Charlotte Gainsbourg over to play in the box, a number of A-list actors, including Tim Robbins and Sean Penn, have expressed interest in getting involved in any way Gondry sees fit. Comedian Dave Chappelle, whose documentary film Dave Chappelle's Block Party was directed by Gondry, has also offered to perform a free concert in the box next month. ""Everyone wants to be in that box right now,"" actor Jim Carrey said. ""Whatever he's doing in there, I'm sure it's genius."" According to Gondry's son, Paul, the box has not only engaged the Academy Award'winning screenwriter's whimsy, but has also afforded him a private space where he can nap, eat all of his meals, and store his dress-up clothes. ""I've never seen him so excited about anything before,"" said the 17-year-old. ""His dedication is inspiring. It's cool to see someone spend 20 hours a day doing something they love."" Gondry, who has been praised for using innovative visual effects over two decades of filmmaking, said that by arranging the box in various positions he was able to pretend it was a flying dinosaur's nest, a witch's cauldron, a chariot, a ghost box, a whale's stomach, and a table. After much anticipation, Gondry held a press conference in his home Monday evening to unveil the box and answer questions from eager entertainment journalists. ""You're standing in hot lava,"" Gondry said. ""That's going to melt you."" Gondry told reporters that immediately upon acquiring the six-sided carton, he abandoned his paper-towel tube, which he had previously used as a spyglass to watch pirates, a horn to turn himself into a unicorn, and a trumpet to make ""mouth jazz."" Gondry concluded the press conference by placing the box over his head and declaring that he was a lonely building without a skyline to call home. Richard Lovett, president of Creative Artists Agency, which represents Gondry, said that where others only see an empty cardboard box, Gondry sees the opportunity for distinct artistic expression with commercial viability. ""Thanks to Michel, cardboard is hot,"" Lovett said. ""Cardboard boxes are in. When you see Michel Gondry with a cardboard box, you want to green-light that."" According to Lovett, CAA is already entertaining an offer from an unnamed studio to purchase domestic and international rights to Gondry's cardboard box for $18.4 million. While Gondry has not yet come out of his box to negotiate the deal, he has reportedly said that the money would cover much of the yarn budget for another upcoming project.","entertainment, celebrities, movies, news, vol 44 issue 19, entertainment"

2995,Atlantic City Cocktail Waitress Crowned In Mistress USA Pageant,"TRENTON, NJ'Lacey Lauderdale, a 25-year-old cocktail waitress at the Showboat Casino & Hotel in Atlantic City, was named the winner of the 2008 Mistress USA Pageant, a competition held each year since 1954 to honor the country's most beautiful and talented other women. The clandestine pageant took place Sunday evening in a New Jersey motel room off Exit 23, shortly after the nation's males told their wives they were going out bowling with some friends. Sixty-three mistresses'one representing each state and 14 representing Carson City, NV'competed for the coveted crown, traditionally awarded to the woman who best exemplifies the qualities of youth, sexiness, and having large breasts. ""We are proud to present Ms. Lauderdale with the grand prize of one year's rent, a basket of erotic massage oils, and this red lace undergarment, which she must try on right now,"" said the Mistress USA chairman, who identified himself only as ""Mr. R."" ""Lacey, we admire you for your dedication to not getting emotionally involved with the nation, and for your willingness to do things my wife would never try in a million years. Now twirl around a little so we can get the view from the back."" The 62 losing contestants were then told to get lost. Lauderdale became eligible to enter the Mistress USA Pageant last October, when she was crowned Miss One-Night Stand New Jersey. She joined a field of mistresses from all different backgrounds and walks of life'waitresses, secretaries, hostesses, and even bar girls. Lauderdale excelled in nearly every event, including the swimsuit competition, the evening-wear- removal competition, and giving hand jobs. She also received the high score from judges Adam Carolla, 47-year-old accountant Cy Weintraub from Chicago, and former New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani. The mistresses were rated in areas such as firmness/roundness of breasts, color of hair, level of economic dependence, willingness to answer to the name ""Hazel,"" and then their breasts again. The talent portion of the competition was phased out in 1974. ""I can't believe I went from being a cocktail waitress to being Mistress USA,"" Lauderdale said after the ceremony. ""Dreams do come true."" While she received the highest score in pageant history, Lauderdale faltered in the Q&A portion of the competition, giving less than satisfactory answers to the hypothetical questions ""How would you act if you ever ran into me and my wife at the grocery store?"" and ""How many times have I told you not to call the house phone?!"" Last year's Mistress USA, Tiffani Saunders of Miami, was on hand at the event to present Lauderdale with the ceremonial Mistress USA sash and cab fare home. ""I think Lacey will do a fine job as Mistress USA,"" said Saunders, who has been instructed to go live with her mother and raise the kid on her own. ""I just hope she knows that while the job can be fun at times, it is also really, really exhausting work."" On Friday, Lauderdale embarks on a nationwide tour, during which she will meet with admiring men from around the country in roadside hotels, shopping-mall bathrooms, and other discreet locations. Historically, the main duties of Mistress USA have included standing there and looking pretty, not giving American males a hard time, light clerical work, and keeping her damn mouth shut. Though most men claimed they ""could not wait"" to meet Mistress USA, some were disappointed with the decision. ""I would have preferred Mistress Missouri, just because she's a little bit closer,"" said a Missouri husband and father of two who wished to remain anonymous. ""But honestly, I'm just excited about the possibility of having sex with someone who is not my wife."" He added: ""After all, that's what this competition is all about."" Just two days after being awarded the title, however, Lauderdale's Cinderella story was mired in controversy when the New York Post revealed that the new Mistress USA had never worked as a stripper.","entertainment, gambling, news, vol 44 issue 18, entertainment"

2997,Oprah Launches Own Reality,"(CHICAGO)'Calling it the next logical step in her celebrated career, and a groundbreaking achievement in applied quantum field theory, media giant Oprah Winfrey unveiled her latest project Monday: a completely separate realm of existence, known as >OpraH, which she will control on the subatomic level. ""Now, Oprah's always on!"" Winfrey said through an interspatial image of herself broadcast between her world and ours. ""I've created a place where anyone can come to share and laugh and feel totally free from the conventional laws of the physical universe."" ""I invite you all to be guests in my new reality,"" she added. This latest addition to Winfrey's empire'which already includes her flagship talk show, a reality TV program, an influential book club, O magazine, the thoughts and emotions of millions of viewers, and two television networks'is Oprah's first foray into large-scale nucleosynthesis. Developed over the past three years by the theoretical physics wing of her company, Harpo Productions, >OpraH was reportedly created by tearing a small hole in the fabric of known reality. The talk-show host then went about restructuring an infinite number of never-before-seen particles to produce a separate dimension, which is currently oscillating around Chicago. According to her aides, Winfrey was personally involved in the most minute details of planning, from the type of coffee served in the green room of her new studio facility to the genetic makeup of every organism she deemed worthy of receiving life. ""Oprah has always been the queen of her time slot, and now she is the queen of Time,"" said publicist Jackie Guerwith, who noted that Tuesday will be the first day of ""Year O"" in Winfrey's reality. ""All events, sequences, and measurements of motion will now take place between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. Eastern."" Guerwith would not disclose how much Winfrey spent to construct >OpraH, but said that the Emmy Award winner had patented several particles, known as Winfrinos and Oprons, and was looking forward to making a difference in people's lives on a deep, molecular level. ""Oprah's working with Dr. [Mehmet] Oz right now to make some fun and exciting changes to the double-helix structure of common DNA,"" Guerwith said. ""And because Oprah is so giving, you can also expect a few surprises in cellular reproduction, a new and improved visible light spectrum, and maybe even a visit from Gayle!"" Added Guerwith, ""Whether it's rising from poverty to become the richest woman in America, or punching a wormhole through the multidimensional fabric of space-time in order to rule over her own universe, Oprah has proved once again that no obstacle is too big. While she claimed that many standard principles such as Hoyle's steady state theory and relativistic time dilation would function the same way in >OpraH as they do on Earth, Winfrey said the new reality will afford her the opportunity to accomplish some things that were ""just not possible"" in the three-dimensional world of mortal humans. Certain concepts reportedly do not exist in >OpraH, including prejudice, greed, unsuccessful adaptations of Toni Morrison novels, the second law of thermodynamics, and human suffering. To begin populating her new Oprahverse, Winfrey reportedly instructed her staff biologists to obtain semen samples from some of her favorite celebrity guests'most notably actors John Travolta and Denzel Washington'and use them to fertilize eggs harvested from Julia Roberts. Winfrey also maintained that, in >OpraH, all women will be strong and confident while retaining their femininity, pollution will not exist, and no one will die of disease without first making an appearance on her show. ""This is all for you,"" Winfrey told a live studio audience while she used her hands to split a uranium 235 atom following an interview with actor Sidney Poitier, her new biological father. ""I'm going to show you how to live your life better, easier, and more happily. I'm going to show you the best books and the best foods and the best fashions. I'm going to show you everything. Everything."" ""They say the universe is always expanding and contracting,"" added a smiling Winfrey. ""But I'm going to make Pilates mandatory in >OpraH, because there ain't going to be any more expanding, if you know what I mean."" The crowd then burst into uncontrollable laughter for three minutes until a concentrated beam of light emanated from Winfrey's mouth and all fell silent. Despite the mostly positive feedback, a number of scientists have warned that because >OpraH is a solid-state representation of unstable probability fields, it could become dislodged from its self-generated foundation and move across dimensions into our own. ""If that were to happen, all known matter in the universe would implode instantaneously,"" said Mark Chan, a professor of quantum mechanics at Caltech. ""But, God, I'm such a huge fan. Who doesn't love Oprah?"" Though Chan's theory remains contested, every physicist interviewed for this article agreed that, even in >OpraH, the odds of Stedman ever proposing remain too small to calculate.","entertainment, news, vol 44 issue 16, entertainment"

3005,Guy Who Says 'Previously On Heroes' Wishes He Was Guy Who Says 'Previously On Lost',"LOS ANGELES'David Cavanaugh, best known as the guy who says ""Previously on Heroes"" at the beginning of the hit NBC program, revealed to reporters Tuesday that his true career ambition is to become the guy who says ""Previously on Lost"" on the popular ABC show Lost. ""I'm extremely proud of the crucial part I play on Heroes,"" said the 47-year-old voice-over actor, whose role on the show primarily entails alerting viewers that they are about to watch a short montage of scenes from prior episodes. ""I've taken this unseen narrator character as far as anyone can, and I've done everything I set out to accomplish on Heroes. Now I'm ready for the big leagues."" Cavanaugh, who landed his first big ""Previously on"" role during the short-lived CW program Veronica Mars, said he had struggled for years to make ends meet by doing freelance ""To be continued"" jobs and the occasional ""Promotional consideration provided by"" gig. But after landing a dream ""Previously on"" opportunity with the premiere of Heroes, Cavanaugh says there was no looking back. ""Don't get me wrong, there are 'Use only as directed' guys who would kill to be where I'm at, but I know I was meant for so much more,"" Cavanaugh said. ""I'd lose a full syllable making the transition to Lost, but the show has such complex and mysterious recaps that I feel it would give my voice some real opportunities to shine. No offense to the way they do it on Lost, but I can take it in so many new directions."" ""First and foremost, I would hit that t in 'Lost' a little harder, instead of trailing off and leaving the viewer confused and directionless,"" Cavanaugh added. ""That's 'Previously on' 101, if you ask me."" Though Cavanaugh has no professional experience saying 'Previously on Lost,' he said he is confident that his years of vocal training, his love of performing, and his familiarity with speaking two-thirds of the phrase would adequately prepare him for the new challenge. ""It's a daunting task, especially since you can't rely on such actorly tricks as facial expressions and body language,"" Cavanaugh said. ""All I have is my finely tuned instrument and its subtle tones of honesty and vulnerability that envelope the viewers and make them feel safe and informed."" While the increasingly complex plots of network dramas forecast limitless possibilities for the ""Previously on"" industry, Cavanaugh expressed concern over the recent trend of television shows using their own characters to introduce their summarizing montages'seen on both Battlestar Galactica and 24. ""I applaud those shows for taking a creative risk, but it's just not professional,"" said Cavanaugh, singling out Edward James Olmos as the worst offender. ""On-screen actors don't have the skills to pull off a 'Previously on.' They think it's all about hitting the 'P,' because that's the flashy bit, but they have no respect for the 'on.'"" ""Battlestar Galactica'what's that, seven syllables?"" he continued. ""What a waste."" Cavanaugh stressed that while it is important to be technically proficient with enunciation, the quality of the introduction must be rich and compelling or viewers will lose interest before watching a summation of events from previous episodes. ""They record my voice once to play over and over again, so I have to provide a wide scale of emotions in that phrase,"" Cavanaugh explained. ""I need to capture a spectrum of feelings for every conceivable situation that could happen during a recap. That's just the kind of adaptability I could bring to Lost."" Though his desired position at Lost is not yet open and producers have not shown any interest in rerecording the show's recap introduction, Cavanaugh has begun compiling a three-hour demo reel to showcase the thousands of ways he can deliver the three-word narration. But as the plots to network dramas grow increasingly complicated, Cavanaugh believes the ""Previously on"" field is wide open. ""There's so much that can still be done with short-form, pre-episode narration,"" Cavanaugh said. ""Between Grey's Anatomy, Lost, and the occasional reality TV show episode after there has been a fistfight between the contestants, we are truly entering a golden age of saying 'Previously on.'""","entertainment, celebrities, tv, news, vol 44 issue 13, entertainment"
3006,Dancer Risks Everything,"CHICAGO'Although she stood to lose her friends, her family, and everything she had worked for her entire life, classically trained dancer Cassie Lisbon, 18, put it all on the line Saturday night when she performed a highly controversial ballet/hip-hop-fusion routine at the Chicago Academy for the Arts' annual spring recital. The routine, which defied all reason and social order by combining the elegance of ballet with dangerous, never-before-seen ""street"" moves such as spinning on one's knees and snapping fingers, reportedly lasted four and a half minutes. According to Lisbon, the bold and provocative number was the culmination of a month of rehearsals, 18 years of feeling like she was destined for something special, and six weeks of dating a troubled, but gifted, in-your-face competitive dancer and high school dropout. ""It was like my whole life was just preparation for that one moment,"" said Lisbon, who added that everything had gone silent as she stood backstage before her routine and suddenly realized that it was this recital or never. ""I danced the only way I know how'from the heart. Because in the 'hood and on the dance floor there are no second chances."" ""I don't care what they say,"" Lisbon added. ""It's my life, and I'm playing for keeps."" Taking the featured spot in the school's final showcase after her uptight former rival, Annabelle, realized she had been following someone else's dream all along and dropped out at the last minute, Lisbon shocked her teachers and fellow students when the classical Stravinsky piece she was dancing to abruptly stopped and morphed into a slightly faster version with a bass beat and rapidly spoken vocals. ""At first I thought something was wrong with the sound system,"" fellow student Maggie Pinchion recalled. ""But when I saw Cassie smile and take out that folding chair, I realized she was just bringing together two radically different worlds to show us all that we can follow the music that beats in our own hearts. It was so tight."" While school administrators are still baffled as to where such a talented ballet dancer could have learned a second form of dancing, some speculate Lisbon may have ventured out into the rough but vibrant neighborhoods surrounding the private academy. ""I can only assume that Cassie must have visited one of the local nightclub establishments where teens hang out and perform spontaneous, elaborately choreographed one-on-one dance competitions to the music of a young gentleman named Soulja Boy, among others,"" head instructor James Tillingford said. ""Of course, there's no way Cassie could have infiltrated this subculture, unless she entered a biracial relationship with a young man who wanted a better life for himself than stealing cars and playing ball, someone who could teach her how to let go of her formal training'along with the pain of her mother's untimely death'and just let it flow so she could, in turn, convince his hardened, cynical friends that she was 'not bad for a white girl.'"" Continued Tillingford, ""But she'd have to really bring it."" The only student in the history of the form to realize that ballet is incapable of expressing a whole range of different but equally true emotions, Lisbon said the road to popping and locking onstage wasn't an easy one. At times, Lisbon admitted, she felt like giving up and just performing the highly technical routine of graceful leaps and spins she had been training for over the last decade. Fortunately, her friends were there to encourage her. ""I could never have done it without my new girl Shandra by my side, telling me I had a chance to be somebody and I shouldn't let anyone stop me from achieving my dreams, because where she's from, 'hope' is a four- letter word,"" Lisbon said. ""I have to accept that full scholarship to Juilliard on my own terms."" ""You can't rehearse for life,"" Lisbon added. ""The rhythm is in you."" Lisbon expressed thanks for the support she received from her father, who thought she was throwing her life away with her ""ridiculous dancing hobby,"" but made it to the recital to stand in the back and cheer her on anyway; her boyfriend, Tay, who not only taught Lisbon how to hear the beat of life but also performed a showstopping break-dance routine in the middle of her performance; and her new group of multiracial friends'especially Little Jay, who was tragically killed in a knife fight only two days before Lisbon's final performance. Although she is excited to start her new life at Juilliard, Lisbon said she may defer enrollment for a year in order to mentor a promising, similar-looking sophomore who has plans to shake up next year's lower-budget recital in a style all her own.","entertainment, movies, news, vol 44 issue 13, entertainment"

3010,Novelists Strike Fails To Affect Nation Whatsoever,"LOS ANGELES'The Novelists Guild of America strike, now entering its fourth month, has had no impact on the nation at all, sources reported Tuesday. The strike, which scholars say could be the longest since 1951, when American novelists may or may not have voluntarily committed to a six-month work stoppage, has brought an immediate halt to all new novels, novellas, and novelettes from coast to coast, affecting no one. Nor has America's economy seen any adverse effects whatsoever, as consumers easily adjust to the sudden cessation of any bold new sprawling works of fiction or taut psychological character studies. ""There's a novelists strike?"" Ames, IA consumer Carl Hailes said. ""That's terrible. When is it scheduled to begin?"" The strike kicked off last fall when the NGA announced it had hit a roadblock in negotiations with the Alliance of Printed Fiction and Literature Producers, failing to resolve certain key issues concerning online distribution, digital media rights, and readers just not getting what writers were trying to do with a number of important allegorical devices. After a press conference at the Massachusetts home of NGA president John Updike'who called the strike an attempt by novelists ""to give both the sublime and mundane alike their beautiful due""'members of the guild began picketing their studies, desks, and libraries and refusing to work on any further novels until the APFLP and the American reading public agreed to their demands. So far, sources say, no one has attempted to cross the picket lines, most of which are located in private homes. However, unconfirmed reports indicate that at least one novelist may be breaking the strike by writing under the pseudonym ""Richard Bachman."" ""We must, as a people, achieve a resolution to this strike soon,"" novelist David Foster Wallace said at a rally Monday at Pomona College in Claremont, CA, where he is a professor. ""The thought of this country being deprived of its only source of book-length fiction is enough to give one the howling fantods."" ""I thank you both for coming,"" he added. While the strike has been joined by an estimated 250,000 novelists'225,000 of whom have reportedly stopped in the middle of their first novel'it has done no damage to any measurable sector of the economy, including bookstore chains, newspapers, magazines, all major media, overseas markets, independent film studios, major film studios, actors, editors, animators, carpenters, those in finance or banking, the day-to-day lives of average Americans, or anything else anyone can think of as of press time. A report published last week by the University of Pennsylvania Annenberg School for Communication found that the strike has thus far had an economic impact of approximately 0.00 to 0.01 percent. In addition, consumer habits remain unaffected, with 0 percent of those polled saying their reading habits had changed ""significantly,"" 0 percent saying they had changed ""somewhat,"" and an additional 0 saying they had changed ""slightly."" A significant number of respondents reported no reading habits. Although some initially worried that the strike could affect Hollywood by limiting material for television or film adaptation, fears were quelled when studio executives announced in January that they would continue optioning comic books and graphic novels. The publishing industry itself, which many believed to be most vulnerable, has nonetheless managed to weather the crisis. Publishers have reissued new editions of early, pre-union novelists'such as Robert Louis Stevenson and Jane Austen, both of whom have previously established successful track records'and have seen no no change in monthly sales. Some members of the public attempted to express concern over the prospect of the strike going on much longer. ""If this situation is not brought to a halt soon, it could have serious ramifications for, you know, literary culture, I guess,"" said Kyle Farmer, a Phoenix-area real estate consultant and avid golfer. ""It would be tragic if we had to go a whole year without a new novel from Kurt Vonnegut or Norman Mailer,"" he added, unaware that both authors died in 2007. No high-profile, red-carpet, star-studded telecasts of the PEN/Faulkner Awards, the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction Awards, or the Man Booker Prize Awards were affected by the strike, since no such telecasts have ever existed.","entertainment, economy, news, vol 44 issue 11, entertainment"
3011,Some Old Man Still Churning Out Marmaduke,"MONTGOMERY, TX'Inching his feeble frame toward an old drafting table for quite possibly the millionth time, 83-year-old Brad Anderson begins his day the same way he always has: by closing his eyes and tracing the well-worn outline of America's most lovable dog. Anderson, who completed his 20,000th Marmaduke cartoon last month, first created the funnies-page staple in 1954. Today, almost six decades later, this plucky octogenarian continues his tireless work, bringing laughter and joy to millions of readers long since dead of old age. ""I love what I do,"" said the elderly cartoonist, his body and mind left crippled by an endless and repetitive stream of doodles featuring the Great Dane. ""Working on Marmaduke all this time'why, I couldn't imagine anything more fulfilling."" Apparently uninterested in a life of creative growth and social relevance, Anderson stumbled upon cartooning in his late 20s. Before long, Marmaduke had captured the imaginations of men and women still decades away from owning a color television set. ""To have success like that, it's really quite astonishing,"" said Anderson, who on his deathbed will hopefully be comforted by the knowledge that he has spent an accumulated nine and a half years of his life drawing canine slobber. ""Suddenly, you feel a great sense of validation. A feeling that this was something you were meant to be doing all along."" ""I'll never forget it,"" added Anderson, his famous creation now permanently burned into his failing retinas. Although muscle memory has all but supplanted artistic inspiration and the assistance of a live-in nurse is now required to steady his quivering drawing hand, Anderson said he still has fun with his daily strip. ""Believe it or not, I still get a kick from getting inside Marmaduke's head,"" said Anderson, who, as he grows old alone, can actually better relate to a fictional dog than to most human beings. ""In in some strange way it's almost as if he's alive. Sitting right here, next to me, as I draw."" Though half of his readership was lost to a cholera outbreak, and hundreds more fans likely perished during the Great Chicago Fire of 1959, Anderson has never given up on Marmaduke'a strip that has survived 10 U.S. presidencies, as well as everyone the cartoonist has ever known and loved. ""Throughout my career, the one thing I've tried to do more than anything else was make people smile,"" said Anderson, referring to a goal that now rivals being able to dress himself in the morning and get into bed without the aid of a stepladder at night. ""That's what Marmaduke was always about."" Anderson will be honored this week by the National Comic Strip Artists Association, which had no choice but to acknowledge the now-obsolete senior for his contribution to the art form, his influence on today's cartoonists, and his sheer bewildering duration. When asked if the soulless conduit for another 20 years of Marmaduke cartoons had any new and exciting projects up his sleeve, a coy Anderson replied, ""No.""","entertainment, media, art, news, vol 44 issue 11, entertainment"

""When denied access to IMDb, subjects who were able to correctly remember semi-obscure movie trivia invariably used the tri-snapping method,"" head researcher Dr. Ward Connell said of the study, which consisted of asking volunteers several questions pertaining to a photograph of Dermot Mulroney. ""Secondary findings indicate that using the word 'um' and phrases such as 'oh, you know' enhance the efficacy of this method by nearly 35 percent, and those who used expletives were on average three times more successful.""

""If at all possible, we'd prefer some sort of self-moistening orifice that grips tightly enough to constrain fingers and foreign objects, but also gapes wide enough to fit a human head.""

3018,Area Man Honored To Be One Who Added Death Date To Heath Ledger's Wikipedia Page,"CEDAR RAPIDS, IA'Blake Yardley, 34, told reporters Monday that he felt extremely humbled to have been the individual who, amidst the chaos and sadness of actor Heath Ledger's recent untimely passing, had the foresight and due reverence to add the death date to the star's Wikipedia page. Saying that he is not looking for credit or public acclaim, the Wikipedia editor and Best Value Windows employee called his addition of ""' 22 January 2008)"" to Ledger's online encyclopedia biography a distinct privilege, and something he will cherish for the rest of his life. ""To have my name even associated with Heath Ledger's is a triumph in and of itself,"" Yardley said at a press conference held at his Cedar Rapids apartment. ""But to be the one who was actually responsible for inserting that fateful month, day, and year, and to have essentially closed the parentheses on Mr. Ledger's life, fills me with a tremendous sense of humility, pride, and accomplishment."" ""I just want to thank Heath Ledger's family and friends for giving me the opportunity,"" Yardley added. ""I'm sure they knew of his passing well before I did."" According to Yardley, upon reading the news of Ledger's death on CNN.com, his first thoughts were for Ledger's parents, baby daughter, and Michelle Williams, the actor's former fiancée, . His next thought, for Ledger's Wikipedia page, came immediately, Yardley explained. So immediately, in fact, that, according to a list of IP addresses found in the entry's editing history, Yardley added the date into the free, user-generated online encyclopedia just three minutes after Ledger's death was first reported. ""When I saw that the only thing following Mr. Ledger's name was '4 April 1979,' I knew it was my responsibility as a citizen and a member of the online community to do something,"" Yardley said. ""Somebody had to click on the page's edit function, and, using the correct font and syntax, bring the acclaimed actor's life to the solemn close it rightfully deserved."" Yardley said he had never met Ledger, but just weeks before his death watched A Knight's Tale on TBS and enjoyed it very much. Knowing that Ledger's Wikipedia page would be read by hundreds of millions of people, Yardley frantically wrote and rewrote the 15-character entry multiple times, repeatedly clicking on the ""show preview"" option to make sure the spacing was perfect. ""I couldn't decide whether to write January as 'Jan.' or 'January,'"" Yardley said. ""I ended up spelling out the month because I thought it was the respectful thing to do. That's also how whoever added the day of Anna Nicole Smith's death did it."" However, only moments after clicking on the ""Save page"" button, Yardley realized he had neglected to change the word following the closing parenthesis from ""is"" to ""was."" But when he attempted to make the correction, Yardley told reporters, he was ""deeply saddened"" to find that somebody, between the time he added the death date and the time the page went live, had already altered that portion of Ledger's biography. ""I was shocked when I saw that,"" said Yardley, adding that he took a personal moment to grieve the lost opportunity. ""But I guess that's how unpredictable life can be sometimes. One second you're on top of the world as the author of a crucial Wikipedia entry, and the next second it's all gone. Poof."" Said Yardley: ""If I could go back and change anything about that fateful day, that would surely be it."" Though Yardley is proud of all his contributions to the user-moderated encyclopedia, he noted that this recent triumph brought with it a greater level of fame than any of his previous Wikipedia updates, which include the number of attendees at a 2006 Dave Matthews concert and the name of Bruce Willis's dog. ""I don't want this to turn into some type of media spectacle,"" Yardley said. ""I just want to continue doing what I do, far from the national spotlight, without worrying about who's keeping track.""","entertainment, celebrities, death, old internet, news, vol 44 issue 07, entertainment"

3020,World Leaders Gather To Roast Mahmoud Ahmadinejad,"GENEVA'In what observers are calling an unprecedented opportunity for the international community to express its grievances against Iran's controversial leader, dozens of world leaders and key U.N. delegates gathered Saturday to roast Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The event, which took place beneath U.N. headquarters in the historic Geneva Friars Club, brought together the heads of every G8 member state, as well as some of today's top foreign policy makers and peace brokers. Roastmaster and former U.N. secretary general Kofi Annan kicked off the evening by welcoming President Ahmadinejad to ""what [was] sure to be the first and last time Mahmoud would ever be surrounded by 72 virgins."" ""Ladies and gentlemen, and Tony Blair, we stand here in the presence of one of the most vicious and destructive forces in the world today'but enough about Bea Arthur,"" said Annan, gesturing with a tumbler of Makers Mark across the long white tables of chuckling diplomats to the former Golden Girls star. ""Some people here tonight will tell you that Mahmoud refuses to engage in diplomatic talks, that he is the most ruthless stonewaller who has ever lived. Well, those people have obviously never met my first wife."" The black-tie affair brought together representatives from warring nations and longtime enemies who sat in the hallowed, oak-walled dining room and patiently awaited their turn to lambaste Ahmadinejad. Some of the evening's most pressing topics included the Iranian president's insistence on developing a nuclear program, his possible involvement in the 1989 assassination of an exiled Kurdish leader, and his excessive body hair. ""You know, a lot of folks have been criticizing Ahmadinejad for covering up one of the most horrifying and unspeakable crimes ever perpetrated on humankind,"" Russian president Vladimir Putin told the assembled guests. ""But don't you listen to them, Mahmoud. I happen to like your beard."" Ahmadinejad, seated in a plush red armchair just to the right of the podium, seemed in high spirits as he calmly endured countless ribs from his allies and fellow arms-race competitors. Rolling his eyes and shaking his finger in mock disapproval, he was taken to task for everything from his brutal treatment of political dissidents to his recent visit to Columbia University. ""Mahmoud'now this is true'said that there are no homosexuals in Iran,"" roaster and Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf said, ""and I for one believe him. After all, if a cock-hound like Mammers can't find a single puckered asshole in all of Persia to slap his balls against, then what's the use of any of us trying?"" Musharraf went on to update the group on the status of Ahmadinejad's mouth, opening the floor to debate on whether or not it has sheltered a greater number of fundamentalist Muslim dicks than the Sudan. Also speaking at the event were Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, Japanese prime minister Yasuo Fukuda, and longtime foreign policy adviser and roast favorite Henry Kissinger, who spent the majority of his speech making sexual overtures to French president Nicolas Sarkozy's bride, model Carla Bruni. Although Bruni was seated in the audience, Kissinger politely offered her a seat on his face so he could get a better look at the only place a French leader has successfully invaded since Lombardy. But a surprise visit from Israeli president Shimon Peres may have been the most popular act of the evening. ""On the way here tonight, someone told me that Mahmoud was a Shi'a,"" said Peres, placing one hand on Ahmadinejad's shoulder. ""At first I thought they were saying 'He's a shit,' because the two sound so similar. But there's a big difference: One's a brown, foul-smelling tube of solid waste'and the other comes out of my asshole."" Peres then addressed Ahmadinejad's well-known denial of the Holocaust and his recent statements that Israel and all Jewish people should be ""wiped off the map."" Taking a long pull from his cigar and adjusting his shirt cuffs, Peres concluded that, in all likelihood, the president of Iran has fucked more Jews than Sarah Silverman. Next up was President George W. Bush, who began his remarks by pulling a small piece of what he claimed was plutonium from behind Ahmadinejad's ear. Bush then told him that this was only the first of two bombings he would witness an American president perform this year. ""What the hell is with that last name, anyway?"" Bush said. ""Ahmadinejad? Ahmendinifragelisticexpialidocious? I can't even pronounce it, let alone write it on a top-secret Black Ops memo.""

3021,Milla Jovovich Inducted Into Basic Cable Hall of Fame,"CINCINNATI'Screen star Milla Jovovich, famed for her work in Resident Evil, Resident Evil: Apocalypse, and The Fifth Element, was inducted to the Basic Cable Hall of Fame in a semi-lavish ceremony held in the organization's Swayze Auditorium Friday.

""I definitely think the verdict is still out,"" said Dylan, adding that time will be the ultimate judge of whether he or the elder Dylan will turn out to be more influential. ""Sure, by the time Dad was 21, he had already written 'Blowin' in the Wind,' but let's not forget I'm only 38. I'm still maturing as an artist, and I have a whole notebook of ideas."" Dylan added that he may have caused a greater stir in the music world than his father ever did when he was mercilessly booed for performing an acoustic version of ""One Headlight"" at Pennsylvania's Fayette County Fair in 2005.","entertainment, family, summer music, concerts, news in brief, vol 44 issue 05, entertainment"

""In fact, Brett Butler has not been photographed at all since 1999."" ""Thank you, Ms. Butler,"" Newton added. ""Finally, there is someone whom young girls can truly look up to as a role model."" Though Butler has had her share of problems in the past, her publicist, Cindy Brenneman, proudly noted that Butler has been sober for three years, no longer abuses sleeping pills, and rarely leaves her house. ""Brett is doing relatively great,"" Brenneman said. ""She has shown incredible class and integrity recently by not getting wildly intoxicated and climbing behind the wheel of a car without a license, abusing narcotics to the point that she is putting her own children's lives in danger, sobbing uncontrollably on live television about a puppy, or killing a man in cold blood, like Home Improvement's Patricia Richardson did in July."" Despite her current state, however, experts predict that the exposure Butler will receive from being thrust once again into the national spotlight will likely send her spiraling into a drug-fueled depression and will be capped by a fatal overdose of painkillers in her Miami hotel room early next year.","entertainment, celebrities, drugs, women, news, vol 43 issue 51, entertainment"
3038,Jackie's 10 Best Entertainment Moments of 2007!,"Item! Should old acquaintance be forgot? No, it should be remembered and celebrated. And what better way to remember our favorite acquaintances'celebrities'than by counting down the 10 biggest celebrity moments of 2007! Are you ready, celebrity friends and celebrity fiends? Live Earth! When I was younger, there was a concert event that swept the world, and that was Live Aid! All the greats were there: Phil Collins, Ashford and Simpson, Ultravox, the Four Tops, you name them and they played! I was too young to go to any of the performances, but I was swept up in whatever cause it was for, and in the music. I made myself a promise that if there were ever such a rocking event again, I wouldn't miss it for the world. Then, this year, it was announced that Live Earth would be another global concert held for global warming, with tons of bands and Al Gore. Wow! The thing was, it was right during July Sweeps, so I couldn't go. I did watch parts of it on AOL, though, and it was pretty good. Bob Baker Leaves The Price Is Right! Big money. No whammys. STOP! But it's too late. The Whammy has taken one of our greatest television personalities off the air for good. I have three cats, and every time I pet them, I say a quiet thanks to Bob Baker for reminding me to spay or neuter them. Farewell, sweet prince. Shrek 3 Fever Hits Our Shores! You could run from this green ogre and his sassy donkey, but you couldn't hide. Shrek 3 fever hit our shores, leaving millions afraid that they wouldn't be able to hide from this entertaining malady. The only cure for this incredibly infectious disease? Laughter! And fortunately, that's one of the symptoms! Rosie Leaves The View Baker wasn't the only one who left a void in daytime television. The View, daytime programming's oasis of sanity for women, lost one of its strongest voices. Rosie O'Connell is one of the brassiest dames out there, and the silence from her abrupt departure was deafening. Posh Spice Moves to the U.S.! Years after The Spice Girls broke up, Posh Spice was shrouded in mystery. That veil of secrecy came down when she and her football-playing husband decided to take up residency here in the good old U. S. of A. And it's about time! We could use a little royalty here. I mean, we got Princess Fergie, but she's become a lot less royal since she started singing about her humps, whatever those are. Everyone Went To Jail! I promised not to mention them until they cleaned up their act, and with one out of rehab but without a blockbuster under her belt, and one pregnant out of wedlock, there's only one left who seems to have turned over a new leaf. So I officially dust off the name Paris Hilton and say, ""Welcome home, sister!"" I think that 2008 will really be the Year of Paris. Whoopi Joins The View After endless weeks of waiting, the question ""Who will be the next View talker?"" was answered with a resounding ""Whoopee! It's Whoopi!"" Any fears people had that the woman filling the seat wouldn't have the outsider view of a world-famous celebrity were put to rest. The Matrix Reloads! The new View host wasn't the only lingering question in people's minds. The question of what would happen to Keeneau Reeves character Nee-Yo was finally answered as well. I can't give it away, because I'm no spoiler, but let's just say that he sure can dance! Now if only they would resolve The Ring Trilogy. The Reunion Shows! The Police. The Eagles. There were probably more, but those are the only two I cared about. Could a dream double-bill be in the future? I can only imagine a Policing the Eagles or Getting Pulled Over in the Fast Lane tour. Imagine? I'm already in line! Jackie Harvey Loses 10 Pounds! The haters said it couldn't be done, but I showed them. What's my secret? I cut down on the cupcakes and did a little more time on the Nordic Trek. And if I can do it, so can you! Wow! What a year that was. It made me a little sad that it was all over, but it makes me more eager than ever to see what 2008 brings. Will Viggo Morganstern grow his beard back? Will Will Smith drop a new joint? Will Kate Pearson from the B-52s ever answer my letters? I know one thing: The only way to tell for sure is to check back next time and see what's inside the Outside. And for my New Year's resolution, I resolve to be a leaner, meaner (but still nice) entertainment journalist, digging deeper than ever before. So until then, bring the popcorn, and I'll see you on the Outside! Jackie Harvey graduated from Viterbo University with a degree in English literature in 1990. After honing his writing and copy-editing skills at The Sunshine Shopper, he became The Onion's entertainment columnist in 1994, replacing the outgoing Archie 'Arch' Danielson. Currently, Harvey writes his regular column, ""The Outside Scoop,"" as well as his blog, ""Harveywood!""","entertainment, commentary, vol 43 issue 51, jackie harvey, entertainment"

3042,Sources: George Clooney Looking Good,"HOLLYWOOD'According to sources from every imaginable demographic across the United States, Canada, Europe, and the rest of the civilized world, Academy Award'winning actor and two-time People magazine 'Sexiest Man Alive' George Clooney is looking good. 'I saw him on the cover of Vanity Fair, clean shaven, and he was looking good,' Austin-area film and TV buff David Haas said Monday. 'Then I saw him on the cover of GQ with a few days' growth, and he was still looking good. He's been looking good since he was Dr. Doug Ross on ER, and he'll probably be looking good for his next 20 roles.' 'I wish I looked one tenth as good as he's looking,' Haas added. Clooney ' whose steely gaze and easygoing personality have consistently captivated millions around the globe, across all categories of race, religion, class, gender, and sexual orientation ' has for the past 25 years attained the highest possible scores in every known measure of physical, psychological, and spiritual attractiveness. A recent poll conducted by the Pew Research Center revealed that 18 percent of respondents described Clooney as looking 'distinguished,' 11 percent found him looking 'sharp,' and 3 percent found him looking 'square-jawed and rugged, yet stately and reserved, as one would expect a baron or king to look.' The poll had no statistical margin of error. 'When you think of George Clooney, the first thing you think is 'sexy,'' said Julia Allison, editor-at-large for Star magazine. 'The second thing you think is 'hunky,' and the third thing is 'dishy.' Then you think that, even if he were to get into a disfiguring accident, he would probably still come out with a face too dreamy for words. I love you, George Clooney.' Whether viewing Clooney in a meticulously posed portrait by famed celebrity photographer Annie Leibowitz, in a candid photo toweling off his tousled hair near a pool, or in a paparazzi snapshot emerging from a grocery store, modern science remains unable to quantify just how phenomenally attractive the universally beloved Kentucky native actually is. 'The subject's masculine yet disarmingly friendly features, from what we have been able to determine, do not appear to be constricted by the laws of physics,' said Princeton University geneticist Dr. Janet Hargrove, whose exhaustive, decade-long study of Clooney's appearance concluded that the 46-year-old has only gotten better-looking with time. 'From his modest beginnings as George Burnett, the long-haired repairman on the 1980s sitcom The Facts of Life, onward through his sexy ascent to Hollywood leading man, his facial features have defied the Second Law of Thermodynamics by being impervious to entropy.' Hargrove continued, 'Unlike most carbon-based organisms, which will, over time, succumb to the ravages of cellular decomposition and genetic degradation, Clooney, with his puppy-dog eyes and salt-and-pepper hair, has aged like a fine wine.' The multitalented actor-director-producer-humanitarian has further impressed audiences and critics alike by choosing his projects judiciously, working on films with artistic integrity and social merit, and lending his A-list status to high-profile charity work. His down-to-earth persona and deep belief in equality for all'as evidenced on the set of Three Kings, where he came to blows with director David O. Russell over the treatment of an extra'only adds to his overwhelming charisma. Plus, sources agree, he has this little thing he does with his eyebrow that is just adorable. 'Just look at the guy,' Center for Media Studies director Robert Kubey said. 'That jaw, those eyes. And he's not just some pretty face'he's a very talented actor. Even I would probably follow him to the end of the earth if he asked me to, and I've been happily married for 14 years.' Despite the mounting scientific evidence and overwhelming public sentiment, some continue to disagree with the assessment that Clooney is looking good. 'Looking good?' Nutley, NJ resident Laura Fine said. 'You must be kidding. Did you see Ocean's Thirteen? He's looking better than ever.' Clooney, in typical humble fashion, had no comment on this story.","entertainment, celebrities, george clooney, movies, news, vol 43 issue 50, entertainment"

3057,Mel Brooks Starts Nonprofit Foundation To Save Word 'Schmuck',"NEW YORK'Saying he could no longer stand idly by while a vital part of American culture is lost forever, activist and Broadway producer Mel Brooks has founded a private nonprofit organization dedicated to preserving the word ""schmuck."" ""Schmuck is dying,"" a sober Brooks said during a 2,000-person rally held in his hometown of Williamsburg, Brooklyn Monday. ""For many of us, saying 'schmuck' is a way of life. Yet when I walk down the street and see people behaving in foolish, pathetic, or otherwise schmucky ways, I hear only the words 'prick' and 'douche bag.' I just shake my head and think, 'I don't want to live in a world like this.'"" The nonprofit, Schmucks For Schmuck, has compiled schmuck-related data from the past 80 years and conducted its own independent research on contemporary ""schmuck"" usage. According to Brooks, the statistics are frightening: Utterances of the word ""schmuck"" have declined every year since its peak in 1951, and in 2006, the word was spoken a mere 28 times'17 of these times by Brooks himself. The study indicates that today, when faced with a situation in which one can use a targeted or self-deprecating insult to convey a general feeling of disgust, people are 50 times more likely to use the word ""jerk"" than ""schmuck,"" 100 times more likely to use ""dick,"" and 15,000 times more likely to use ""fucking asshole."" Perhaps more startling, only 23 percent of men know what schmuck means, and only 1.2 percent of these men are under the age of 78. If such trends continue, Brooks estimates that by 2011, such lesser-used terms as ""imbecile,"" ""dummy,"" ""schlub,"" and ""contemptible ne'er-do-well"" will all surpass schmuck, which is projected to completely disappear by the year 2020 or whenever Brooks dies. ""We must save this word!"" Brooks said to thunderous applause as those in attendance began chanting ""Schmuck! Schmuck! Schmuck!"" ""How will we be able to charmingly describe someone who acts in an inappropriate manner? Especially given the tragic loss of the word 'schmegeggie' in 2001. So I urge you: Tonight, when you get home, please, call up your family, your friends, your loved ones, and tell them they're a bunch of schmucks."" ""I've never told anyone this before,"" Brooks added, choking back tears, ""but my father was a schmuck."" The foundation has already raised more than $20 million, thanks to donations from supporters such as Jackie Mason, Albert Brooks, the Schtupp Institute, Sen. Russ Feingold (D-WI), and the Henny Youngman Endowment for the Preservation of Schmekel. The money will go toward projects aimed at reintegrating ""schmuck"" into the English lexicon, including billboards and flyers plastered with the word ""schmuck,"" the upcoming 5K Schlep for Schmuck Awareness, and a new Mel Brooks film. ""The world cannot afford to lose this valuable and versatile word,"" Brooks told reporters during a charity auction in Manhattan's Upper West Side Tuesday, where attendees bid for the chance to have a private lunch with Brooks and repeatedly call him a schmuck. ""You can be a poor schmuck, a lazy schmuck, a dumb schmuck, or just a plain old schmuck. A group of people can be collectively referred to as schmucks. You can call someone a schmuck, and you can be called a schmuck. You can even call yourself a schmuck."" ""Plus, it's just so fun to say,"" Brooks added. ""Schmuck."" Many of the foundation's volunteers say they share Brooks' passion for the word ""schmuck,"" as well as his outrage that it is slowly disappearing from everyday use. They claim that if they do not act now, the trend could create a snowball effect. ""Today it's schmuck, tomorrow it might be toochis,"" said SFS volunteer Harry Steinbergmann, 82. ""What's next, schlemiel? Putz? Schlimazel?"" Steinbergmann went on to classify this scenario as farcockteh. Brooks will be appearing at Brooklyn's Francis Scott Key Junior High on Nov. 12 to give an informal lecture about his experiences using the word ""schmuck,"" and build grassroots support among a key group of young Americans by explaining that ""schmuck"" is a Yiddish term for the foreskin on the head of a penis. In addition, he has hinted at the possibility of a reunion with longtime comedy partner Gene Wilder, during which the two will call each other schmucks.","entertainment, human interest, activism, news, vol 43 issue 44, entertainment"

3060,Sugar Ray Thrilled To Be Playing In Man's Head,"SAN DIEGO' After nearly four years without a major live show, alternative rock band Sugar Ray announced Monday that they were ""thrilled beyond words"" to be playing inside San Diego resident Robert Waldie's head. The impromptu concert, which took place between Waldie's temporal lobes early Monday afternoon, was the largest venue Sugar Ray had played since 2001's Surf's Up Festival in Los Angeles. ""It's great to be back,"" announced Sugar Ray frontman Mark McGrath, whose band followed thoughts of a turkey sandwich on rye and a nagging reminder to pay this month's electricity bill when taking the mental stage. ""Playing in front of all our fans like this'we couldn't have asked for anything more."" Sugar Ray headlined the forefront of Waldie's mind through much of Monday afternoon, playing the chorus of their 1997 hit ""Fly"" seven consecutive times before segueing into an all-hum rendition of their second-most popular single, ""Every Morning."" Sugar Ray then played the refrain from ""Fly"" an additional four times before closing their set. ""This was a huge gig for us,"" said Sugar Ray guitarist Rodney Sheppard, who at different times during the show was suddenly replaced with Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry, legendary musician Carlos Santana, and once even Waldie himself. ""I think we were all feeling some pressure at first. After all, so many great bands have played inside Rob's head over the years. We definitely didn't want to disappoint."" ""Hopefully, he liked the show enough to have us back,"" Sheppard added. Although many members of the band claimed the performance was their best in years, the show was reportedly not without its share of mishaps. Halfway through the third repetition of his opening number, McGrath began unexpectedly singing ""Rock Lobster""'a song written and recorded by pop sensation the B-52s'only to return to his original set list moments later. The group was likewise unable to drown out interruptions from Waldie's subconscious, which heckled the band about the need to reconcile with loved ones and nearly derailed the cerebral performance entirely when one of Waldie's coworkers, Heather Forte, appeared half-naked as a backup dancer. In addition, while Sugar Ray was open to playing requests from any of their five studio albums, not a single suggestion came from the one-member crowd. ""Some parts were definitely touch and go. I kept singing 'put your eyes above me, baby' instead of 'put your arms around me, baby,' and Rob didn't call us out for an encore until he was taking a shower later that night,"" McGrath said. ""All in all though, it was a great time. We totally rocked his mind."" According to McGrath, Monday's show was only the beginning of the band's comeback, with future concerts expected in the heads of those within earshot of Waldie's whistling. Though not official, McGrath said a West Coast tour, including a silent, solo performance in San Francisco teenager Mandy Taylor's daydreams, was already being considered. Despite initial excitement from the band, public reaction to Sugar Ray's return has been anything but enthusiastic. ""I wish I could get this stupid song out of my head,"" Waldie said. ""I don't even like Smash Mouth.""","entertainment, music, mental health, summer music, concerts, news, vol 43 issue 43, entertainment"
3061,Report: Everyone In Hollywood Great Friends,"LOS ANGELES'A study released today by the University of California, Los Angeles is sending shockwaves through the social, behavioral, and publicity sciences, after finding that everyone in Hollywood is close personal friends with everyone else in Hollywood. ""The evidence shows that our nation's show-business capital is a town of virtually boundless goodwill and camaraderie, where the backstabbing, ego-rivalry, and grudge-holding common to the rest of society do not exist,"" said UCLA sociology professor Gina Carlisle, lead author of the five-year, 700-page study. ""The entire region is a veritable utopia of deep, abiding interpersonal affection and mutual respect."" Additionally, the report found that 98 percent of Hollywood residents ""love [their friends'] work."" The findings, published this month in the journal American Psychologist, were based on information culled from DVD commentary tracks, promotional junket footage, talk show appearances, more than 1,500 behind-the-scenes magazine profiles, and hundreds of poolside cocktail party conversations. ""I love David Caruso,"" said Caruso's CSI: Miami costar Khandi Alexander, one of thousands of celebrity best friends quoted in the study. ""He's just a great guy'always joking around on the set, making the crew laugh, and just being an all-around wonderful person. At first I thought it would be intimidating to work with such an iconic star, but after a few days, I thought of him as a great friend."" But the intense friendships that run through the Hollywood community also extend to those beyond the red-carpet elite, the study found.  ""Even persons with relatively limited connections to the Hollywood hierarchy, such as caterers and valet attendants, regularly cited such A-list celebrities as George Clooney as their 'good friends,'"" said UCLA's Carlisle, who herself described Clooney as ""a friend."" ""No one is excluded from the near-universal circle of intimacy and brotherhood that surrounds the city."" ""It is a truly egoless culture,"" she added. According to the study, friendships formed in Hollywood are stronger, more passionate, and more meaningful than any friendships yet measured. ""While we were making Transformers, the whole cast and crew were like family,"" actress Megan Fox said in an Access Hollywood episode cited by the study. ""I would totally love to work with those people again if the decision is ever made to do a sequel. That's how much those friendships mean to me."" Hollywood friendships are also longer lasting, researchers found. Producer Gil Netter, also quoted in the study, expressed these sentiments about some of his many best friends: ""When we did Dude [Where's My Car?], Ashton [Kutcher], Jennifer [Garner], and Seann [William Scott] were just on the verge of exploding. Since then, they've all become much bigger stars, but to me they're still just the same great friends of mine they always were."" The study's authors say if research continues, the principles of social interaction found in Hollywood could, one day, serve as an example to the rest of humanity of how to live together in harmony and universal love. ""Bad-mouthing others' work, looking down on those who earn less money than oneself, making insulting assumptions about the amount of plastic surgery others have had'none of these things happen in Hollywood,"" Carlisle said. ""It is a city of total and unconditional respect, both for the integrity of everyone's creative endeavors, and for everyone personally, as human beings."" Added Carlisle: ""If every community could interact with the same genuine compassion and goodwill that Hollywood has somehow achieved, the world would be a much better place.""","entertainment, celebrities, human interest, friends, news, vol 43 issue 43, entertainment"

""[Ken and Barbie] were dumb and ugly so now they're going to lose their home and it's going to wind up in the garbage,"" said the big jerk, who predicted that since the dolls have not made a single payment, he might just have to cut off all of Barbie's hair to sell it for extra money. ""Maybe they can move into a shoe box that they barely fit into. But it won't have any windows so they'll suffocate and die.""

3068,I Just Discovered This Hilarious Comic Strip Called 'Garfield',"I don't usually spend a lot of time reading the comics pages (you know me: straight to the real-estate section!), but last weekend I found this great new one called Garfield. Man, oh, man, I suggest you remember the name, because it's going to open up a whole new world of entertainment for you. Trust me. You're going to love it. Okay. First off, he's a cat. But not just any ordinary cat'as if! He's a lazy, fat cat with a whooooooooole lot of attitude. I'm cracking up right now just thinking about him! This cat has an in-your-face approach to dealing with life, that's for sure, and he doesn't care what anybody thinks about it. I know, I know, at first I had the same reaction you must be having right now: How can an animal display human characteristics? It's just not plausible. But once I got over that initial hurdle, I realized that, odd as it may sound to the uninitiated, there's actually a great deal of comic possibilities in that crazy, seemingly impossible premise. But I'm getting ahead of myself. You're probably a little confused, taking in so much new information at once. Let me slow down and give you some specific examples, just to convey the general gist of this irrepressible kitty. Oh, Garfield. Where to begin, where to begin. There's so much to tell you! Okay. Garfield'who always has this expression of ""Yeah, whatever""'lives with his human owner, Jon, whom he just so happens to drive absolutely bonkers with his cynical ways. There's also a dog whom our feline friend does not like at all. (His name's Odie, and he really gets on Garfield's nerves.) All Garfield cares about is eating, and guess what his favorite food is? Lasagna! It's totally fattening, but he eats it anyway, even though he's already fat. He just doesn't care. But that's Garfield for you. Oh, by the way, don't get him started on weight loss. When it comes to dieting, his attitude is ""die"" with a ""T""! I'd like to see that on a T-shirt. In fact, I bet there's a lot of money to be made with such a venture, if the cartoonist could just be convinced to take a chance on the idea. Anyway, when Garfield's not eating, the only other thing he cares about is'you'll never guess this one'sleeping. You think that's funny? Guess where he sleeps. In pans of lasagna. Can you believe it? Who would ever sleep in a lasagna pan? Well, Garfield, that's who! He loves both so much that he's willing to combine them into one sidesplitting, perfectly irreverent visual combination you have to see to believe. Garfield's always a bit of a grouch, but there's one day you really don't want to mess with him. Monday. Oh, boy. I've never met anyone who hates Mondays quite as much as this wicked kitty! But, I've got to tell you, as ornery as he is about it, part of me can't blame him. After a nice, relaxing weekend, who in their right mind would look forward to another five days of work (or putting up with Odie's incessant slobbering!) before it's Friday again? Ugh! I thought, ""Hold on'this Garfield guy's been reading my mail!"" And that's the way it is panel after panel after panel. He may be one rude dude, but his offbeat quips are a real kick-in-the-pants reality check, Garfield style. I was so impressed that I asked some of my coworkers about him. Apparently he's been around for a while and he's even in a couple of movies! They star someone named Bill Murray, whoever that is. From what I understand, Garfield himself is up there on the screen, walking and talking like in the cartoon drawings, but in live action, just like any other actor. I guess they can do just about anything with computers these days. I could go on and on, but you've really got to check it out yourself. Just look in the newspaper under comics, and you'll find it in there. If you can't find it, I have some clippings I could lend you as long as you get them back to me. I promise, this cartoon cat is like nothing you've ever encountered in your life. Forget propriety, forget politeness'when it comes to saying what's on his mind, this is one wisecracking feline who leaves the rule book at home! This guy is going to be huge'and no, I don't just mean fat.","opinion, entertainment, media, comics, commentary, vol 43 issue 41, katie hyerdahl, entertainment"

3072,I'm Still Dazzled By The 2007 Emmy Awards!,"Item! What do you get when you take the brightest television stars, put them in the best theater imaginable and let the cameras roll? No, it's not a new reality series, but rather the greatest awards show of the summer! I'm talking, of course, about the 2007 Emmy Awards, a celebration of the art of television. I usually try to prepare for the Emmys by watching a lot of television, but this year I had a lot of gardening to do, so I didn't get much of a chance to get myself in the tube mood. Turns out I didn't need it. Ryan Seecrest has really proven himself to be the heir to the Dick Clark throne when it comes to being a natural in front of the camera. The night wasn't all about good feelings, though. I was sad because Desperate Housewives was robbed! It made me realize how quickly Hollywood can turn its back on a great show. It went away soon enough when Helga Miren won for Best Lead Actress in a Miniseries or Movie, though. That makes an Oscar and an Emmy for Helga this year, making 2007 the official Year of Miren! Kudos to the Television Academy of Sciences for making the tough decision to go green this year. The carbon footprint of the entire proceedings was offset by planting a tree somewhere in Oregon. What a lucky tree! By the way, I'm considering going green myself. I've always been an avid fan of recycling, but now I'm thinking about starting a compost pile. I'm not too keen on keeping a bunch of stinky orange peels and coffee grounds around the house, but if it saves a tree, I'm willing to do my part. Item! Speaking of television, the new season is finally here! It looks like there's a ton of new shows to capture the imagination, and I can't wait to roll up my sleeves and dive right in! Johnny Gallecki is back, and I couldn't be happier. And another season of Heroes? Super-cool! The new lineup has me thinking: Could Monday be the next Thursday and CBS be the next NBC, with NBC becoming the next ABC? What's Andie McDowell been up to these days? I see her in makeup ads, but I don't see nearly enough of her where she belongs, on the big screen. Come on, Hollywood! Wake up and smell the casting! Item! Besides The Transformations, you know who else has more than meets the eye? Actor Shy-Guy LaBoof! From the moment I saw him in Holey Moley, I thought to myself, ""There's a kid to keep my eye on."" And I was right! With two blockbusters under his belt this year, I think this is really his year. I understand that Mr. LaBoof is Jewish, so mazel tov to you, young man! Now that the dust has cleared, I am beginning to think I was a little hard on Lindsey Lohen. It's hard to be an entertainment journalist and not hold celebrities up to certain standards. But now that she's pretty much done for, I am going to make a promise. Unless there is some gossip so great that I can't possibly keep it inside, I will not mention her name until she gets another No. 1 movie. Deal? Item! I'm just gripped by The War, the new World War II documentary by TV filmmaker Charles Burns. Before watching it, I was on the fence about whether those who fought were the greatest generation. Now, I am 100 percent sold. Thanks, PBS, and keep up the good work! Do they still make NordicTracks? Good exercise should never go out of style. Item! Seems that exonerated murder suspect O.J. Simpson is in legal trouble againfthis time for unpaid parking tickets! Apparently the Juice had been meaning to pay the tickets, but was just distracted, and now has to pay the tickets or face a higher fine! That's what you get when you walk on the wrong side of the law, O.J.! I think I'm going to spend my next vacation in Vermont. Everyone's always talking about how lovely it is. Item! What's the deal with all these books about dogs? You can't even walk into a bookstore without running into a stack of them. What about cats? I have three cats and a lot of ideas. Well, that wraps it up for another edition of the Scoop! Check in next time when I have a great story about James Gandolfini, a trip to the pharmacist, an expired prescription, and a case of mistaken identity. Until then, I'll see youfon the outside!

3077,I Couldn't Possibly Accept Your Offer Of Basic Cable Plus Showtime For Just $33 Per Month,"Let me start by saying that I am flattered by this gesture. We barely know each other, and you come to me with this'well, there's no other word for it'generous offer. $33 for more than 200 channels, plus free Showtime for one year? What have I done to deserve such an enormous gesture of magnanimity? As far as I can see, the only qualifications I have as a cable subscriber are having a residence and a cable outlet. Whoo! I feel dizzy. Let me gather my wits here. This must be what it feels like to win an Oscar. All this for me? It's not like I'm the president of a major corporation or anything. I just work as a teller at a bank. Perhaps you've made a mistake, and you think I'm some other Julian Lam. I mean, at least consider raising my rates after the first year. Please. It would make me feel a lot better. Twelve months of free Showtime. Holy cow. Just stop and think for a second'that's a full year of quality Hollywood blockbusters and daring original series like Weeds. In fact, you know what? It's too much. Let me throw in an extra $10 a month for the Showtime. I absolutely insist. I'm still getting the bargain of a lifetime, but I won't be taking advantage of you. I couldn't live with myself if I did. Wait, back up: This isn't the old-fashioned analog cable? If I'm reading this promotional flyer correctly, you're offering me state-of-the-art digital broadcasting. Now, come on! Look, tell you what'why don't you come down to my bank tomorrow, and I'll hook you up with a free checking account or something, because this is too much. With the digital-quality reception you're offering, how can you possibly break even on this deal? That stuff is done with computers, and I know those aren't cheap. Next thing you're going to tell me, this includes some high-definition channels, and for only $5 more a month, I can get an HD-DVR. At least have the wherewithal to charge some sort of penalty, like a cancellation fee, to those customers who welch on this great deal, because surely that will happen. You need to protect yourself somehow. How about this'if I sign on for this cable package, I'll cover any taxes or hidden surcharges. I don't know what they would be offhand, but I'd assume there would be something like a franchise fee and an FCC regulatory fee and a line charge. $10 to $15 extra? No sweat. Oh, okay. I didn't realize a converter box is involved here. How much does that cost? Probably $500, right? No? What? You're throwing that in there too? No equipment purchases necessary? You are being far, far too kind. Don't you have employees to pay, a family to feed? Perhaps you should give it to someone who deserves it. I've had plenty of breaks, believe me. I got the first two months of my gym membership for only $19.99, and once I got a year subscription to Time for more than 50 percent off the cover price. There's got to be someone out there who's down on his luck and could use a deal like this. Forget the year thing I mentioned earlier'raise my rates in six months. You can't run a global communications empire this way. No, stop. Don't even bring up free installation. I live on the fourth floor of my building, and it's dangerous to climb up there with power tools. Let me do it. I know my way around a drill, and I used to paint houses in college. Just give me the instructions and I can do the job. All right, but if you're going to do it, take your time'let me wait at home all day so your installer doesn't put himself out. Hold on. This includes The Movie Channel too? This is getting downright foolish. Sirs, were you not part of a giant corporate merger a couple years back? Surely you have creditors at the door. What would your shareholders say? I sincerely hope you won't offer, even for a limited time, home phone service free on your state-of-the-art advanced fiber-optic  network for the first three months and' My God. You must have the wrong idea. Look, I thank you for your offer, really, but I am in actuality doing quite well for myself, and I refuse to be treated as a pity case. The only way I will even consider this is if you guarantee frequent outages, poor customer service, and a contract that I couldn't get out of even with the best lawyers in the world. I await your response.","opinion, entertainment, products, tv, commentary, vol 43 issue 38, julian lam, entertainment"
3078,Sequel-Hungry Nation Demands Production of Click II,"LOS ANGELES'As the summer movie season comes to an end, hundreds of thousands of deeply disappointed moviegoers converged on Los Angeles this weekend to demand that Hollywood finally honor their wish for a sequel to the Adam Sandler comedy Click. ""When I saw no Click II on my town's multiplex marquee this summer, I felt I had to speak out,"" said North Carolina resident Jim McNulty, who quit his job to travel to the nation's movie capital. ""And I think I speak for virtually all Americans when I say we won't rest until we find out what happens next to nutty everyman Michael Newman and his family."" The group People for the Continuation of Filmic Storylines, the largest of the many organizations in the pro- sequel grassroots movement, has so far gathered 31 million signatures from citizens for a petition mandating that Columbia Pictures, makers of Click, commence work on its sequel. ""Columbia Pictures, hear the mandate of the people!"" PCFS president Holly Sparks said in front of thousands of supporters gathered outside Hollywood's ArcLight Cinemas. ""All those loose ends may have been tied up neatly by the end of the first Click film, but this country has been waiting far too long for those ends to loosen once again so that they can be retied in an equally humorous fashion."" ""The people of this country want to know what kind of crazy cameo Rob Schneider is going to make, and they want to know now,"" Sparks added to deafening cheers. According to Sparks, 2007 has been ""egregiously lacking"" in sequels, only providing movie-continuation fans with the films Spiderman 3, Shrek the Third, Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End, Live Free or Die Hard, Ocean's 13, The Bourne Ultimatum, Hostel: Part II, Evan Almighty, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, Rush Hour 3, Resident Evil: Extinction, Mr. Bean's Holiday, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, and the follow-up to 2003's Daddy Day Care, Daddy Day Camp. ""This summer was a tentative step in the right direction, but we have much, much further to go,"" Sparks said. PCFS, which is credited with catalyzing the soon-to-be-released films John Rambo and National Treasure: Book of Secrets, submitted a 30-page document to Columbia executives stipulating that Click II be set in Hawaii, star Queen Latifah as an antagonist with a more powerful remote than Sandler's, and feature an ending that clearly hints at a third Click movie. ""At the very least, they must bring back that same hot jogger girl, but this time Sandler uses the remote's super-slow-motion button when she bends over,"" demonstrator Liz Ivory said. ""That would be hilarious because everyone would recognize that as a similar joke from the first film. It's what America needs."" According to polls conducted at the nation's movie houses, an overwhelming majority also want to see ""what's her face"" return as Sandler's wife, and Christopher Walken reprise his role as Morty, saying his character had some ""pretty funny"" quirks and lines they would enjoy watching him perform again in the exact same way. More than half said the comedic scenario they would most like to see play out in a Click sequel would be Sandler's device gaining the ability to mute multiple things at the same time. ""In Click we found out what happens when you have a universal remote that controls the universe, but we have absolutely no idea what happens when that same universe has three to five additional characters, including a troublemaking young boy, and the protagonist gets a new job with new, more frustrating challenges,"" Kansas City, MO resident Kyle Ritenour said. ""Also, America wants to know what the original Click would have been like with twice the budget and twice the CGI."" Filmgoers also say that Click II will be a welcome reprieve from such new releases as No Reservations and Superbad, which have forced audiences to become acquainted with totally new and unfamiliar characters. ""When I go to the movies, I just want to sit back and escape to a familiar world where everything makes sense and the only thing that changes is whether or not the lead actor decided to grow a beard for the second film,"" movie fan and frequent imdb.com commenter Steve Klein said. ""Other than that, I don't care what happens."" ""Why didn't they shoot the second movie while they were shooting the first?"" Klein added. ""It would have saved everyone a whole lot of trouble, and would have kept me satisfied until the release of Saw IV, Alien vs. Predator 2, and the sequel to Spider-Man 3.""","entertainment, movies, trends, news, vol 43 issue 38, entertainment"

3082,Pitchfork Gives Music 6.8,"CHICAGO'Music, a mode of creative expression consisting of sound and silence expressed through time, was given a 6.8 out of 10 rating in an review published Monday on Pitchfork Media, a well-known music-criticism website. According to the review, authored by Pitchfork editor-in-chief Ryan Schreiber, the popular medium that predates the written word shows promise but nonetheless 'leaves the listener wanting more.' 'Music's first offering, an eclectic, disparate, but mostly functional compendium of influences from 5000 B.C. to present day, hints that this trend's time may not only have fully arrived, but is already on the wane,' Schreiber wrote. 'If music has any chance of keeping our interest, it's going to have to move beyond the same palatable but predictable notes, meters, melodies, tonalities, atonalities, timbres, and harmonies.' Schreiber's semi-favorable review, which begins in earnest after a six-paragraph preamble comprising a long list of baroquely rendered, seemingly unrelated anecdotes peppered with obscure references, summarizes music as a 'solid but uninspired effort.' 'Coming in at an exhausting 7,000 years long, music is weighed down by a few too many mid-tempo tunes, most notably 'Liebesträume No. 3 In A-Flat' by Franz Liszt and 'Closing Time' by '90s alt-rock group Semisonic,' Schreiber wrote. 'In the end, though music can be brilliant at times, the whole medium comes off as derivative of Pavement.' While Schreiber concedes that music is still 'trying to find its aesthetic,' he also claims the form has not yet lived up to the lavish praise heaped on it by pop culture journalist Chuck Klosterman and 19th-century French romantic composer and critic Hector Berlioz, among others. Schreiber concludes his critique by calling on music to develop a more cohesive sound in its future releases. 'We can only hope that [music] will begin to grow with its fans over the next few millennia,' Schreiber said. 'If it can stick to what it does well, namely the song 'Peg' by Steely Dan, and Tuvan throat singing, then a sophomore effort will indeed be something to get excited about.' The review has split the music community, with many decrying Pitchfork's lukewarm reception of music as a contrarian move designed to propel the publication's tastemaker status. 'It's elitism for the sake of elitism,' said Rolling Stone senior editor David Fricke, who refuted Pitchfork's middling rating, describing the entire art form as 'transcendent.' 'I've been listening to music for over 30 years, and it's consistently some of the best stuff out there.' Despite music's defenders, the Pitchfork review has made a deep impression on the thousands of music fans who slavishly follow the website's advice when it comes to enjoying things. 'Music used to be great, but let's be honest, it's a 6.8 now at best,' said Los Angeles resident Lowell Radler, 23, who admitted that he just looked at the rating rather than reading the whole review. 'I seriously might never listen to music again.' Still, most analysts agreed that the impact of Pitchfork's scathing review of music will be dampened by the 2.4 rating it received from Pitchfork staff writer Dave Maher just moments after the initial critique was published online.

""It's healthy for an actor to be challenged once in a while,"" said Tucker, who is currently working on an Off-Broadway musical adaptation of Rush Hour, a Rush Hour co-starring Jet Li instead of Jackie Chan, an experimental Rush Hour-inspired short to air on the Independent Film Channel, and a top-secret project tentatively titled Rush Hour 4. ""Don't get me wrong, I'm certainly not turning away from or disavowing the more mainstream Rush Hour work. In fact, I'm sure I'll be missing it while shooting Hora Pico in Spain this fall."" Tucker added he also hopes to start work on a novelization of Rush Hour sometime next year.","entertainment, movies, news in brief, vol 43 issue 35, entertainment"

3087,All You Had To Say Was 'Owen Wilson Befriends A Dolphin' And I Was Sold,"Listen'stop talking. I don't need to hear the rest. The first half of the sentence was genius! ""Owen Wilson befriends a dolphin andEE""nd? What ""and""? No ""and"" necessary! Are you kidding me? I'm sold. Sold! I realize you want to finish your sentence, but what can I say? Welcome to the dream factory, baby! I make incredibly quick decisions because I've got the know-how. And I know enough to know that I've already heard as much from you on this project as I'm ever going to need to hear. Capisce? ""Owen Wilson befriends a dolphin."" Bam! Owen Wilson. Befriends. A dolphin. It's perfect. Now, all we need to do is figure out the movie. What? You have a whole concept worked out already? Beautiful'but completely unnecessary. I'll come up with the rest of it, off the top of my head, right now, while I'm on the 405. Believe me, every ounce of attention not taken up by the constant lane-changing is focused like a white-hot laser on your idea right now. That's my job. That's what I do. I'm constantly making key decisions, even while driving. If I slow down for even one minute, I miss out on a great idea like your Owen-Wilson-befriends-a-dolphin thing, so I can't waste my time listening to each and every word of each and every sentence people say to me. Shit! Hold on a sec. Okay, I'm back. Sorry, I had to take that. We're close to a deal on a $200 million live-action Smurfs movie, but I told them I'd call back, because right now I'm putting everything other than this Wilson/dolphin project on the back burner, at least for the next two, possibly even three minutes. So the dolphin helps Wilson fall in love? He splashes them, they get soaked, then they bond over hot cocoa while their clothes are drying'yeah, yeah, whatever. Look, you've already impressed the hell out of me, so don't worry so much about the little details. We'll work those out once we've got a voice for the dolphin, and I'm thinking Mr. Robin Williams. Am I right? You didn't intend to have the dolphin talk? Come on, you can't have a main character in an aquatic-mammal buddy comedy just float around squeaking, can you? We can CGI the hell out of the thing and make it rap and breakdance. We'll get an effects house on that right away so we have some footage in time for the trailers. Speaking of promo, let's talk movie posters: I see Wilson, the dolphin, front seat of a convertible, wearing shades. Yes, both of them. If you think I'm going to make a movie about Owen Wilson befriending a dolphin and not put the slippery little bastard in Ray-Bans, you're crazy! Now, we need to determine how we're gonna get the two of them into space. What? You didn't see it as a sci-fi film? Well, maybe not sci-fi, but it's sure as hell got to have some zero-gravity battle sequences. We're going to have to appeal to more than just your standard rom-com/animal-buddy-movie audience to make it worth our time. Stop talking. I'm sold, I told you. What are you, deaf? You're not one of these ""difficult"" writers who's married to the concept of finishing his sentences, are you? 'Cause if you are, you can take a walk. I've got 40 other meet-and-greets slated for this afternoon alone, so fuck Owen Wilson, fuck the dolphin, and fuck you. I can just as easily throw together something with Vince Vaughn and a giant sea tortoise, and you'll never get so much as a whiff on another spec in this town again. So it's your choice.  Great! I knew you'd come around. Can't wait to work with you on this one. I'll have my girl set up lunch with Owen over at SeaWorld and see what we come up with and get back to you. Ciao, gotta go! Love ya!aa","opinion, entertainment, celebrities, movies, media, commentary, vol 43 issue 33, howie sandberg, entertainment"

3090,Ben Affleck Hoping Jason Bourne Has Sidekick In Next Movie,"LOS ANGELES'Actor Ben Affleck, best known for his role in the 2003 film Daredevil, told reporters Monday he would really like to see action hero Jason Bourne, played by longtime friend Matt Damon, acquire a sidekick in his next film. ""I was thinking that the character, who would probably be Bourne's childhood friend, could really breathe some new life into the series,"" said Affleck, adding that the Jason Bourne character ran the risk of boring American audiences if the superspy wasn't allowed to show a more human side in his films. ""I envision the sidekick as being taller, slightly beefier, and having darker hair than Bourne. He may not be the smartest, but he could provide comic relief and would always look out for his best friend."" ""I know a few people who would play the part,"" the Jersey Girl and Gigli star continued. ""Hell, even I would put some projects aside to do it if that's what the producers wanted."" According to Affleck, the fourth film in the Bourne franchise, which has traditionally taken place in European locales but was most recently set in New York City, needs a refreshing location that would surprise filmgoers, such as gritty South Boston. Just moments after the opening credits, the amnesiac CIA assassin would learn that he grew up there, had an abusive childhood, dropped out of high school, and once worked  as a janitor at a local college. Affleck said he ultimately imagined the film as being less a traditional spy thriller and more about friendship and the importance of realizing one's true potential. ""The sidekick represents the kind of life Bourne would have lived had he never gone off and become a hotshot CIA agent with a big-time career,"" said Affleck, who described the new character as having suffered a string of bad luck and made a number of poor life choices. ""Basically, his character would kill to have Bourne's natural fighting and spying ability, but it's his role in the movie to show Bourne that even though he is a very gifted and talented individual, he should never leave his old friends behind."" Though Affleck, who offered to write the script for free, anticipates more lengthy scenes of dialogue than is typical for a Bourne film, he promised the movie would not be without its signature fight sequences. Affleck said he had already storyboarded one scene, set at a Boston Red Sox game, in which Bourne, the sidekick, and another high school friend, played by director Kevin Smith, get into a fast-paced drunken argument over the film Star Wars and each of their respective mothers. ""How do you like them apples?"" said Affleck, referring to what the sidekick could theoretically say after Bourne breaks the necks of several security guards at Fenway Park. Affleck, who won a Teen Choice Award for his work in 2001's Pearl Harbor, said he plans to pitch the idea to Damon the next time the two see each other, hopefully at an Emmy Awards after-party next month. If Affleck loses his invitation for the event Damon is attending, as he reportedly did last year, he and Damon will discuss the project during one of the rare weekends in which Damon is not working on a film and both actors happen to be at home in their native Massachusetts at the same time. ""I really think he'll go for this,"" Affleck said. ""I know Matt Damon better than anyone in the world, and I just know he's going to love this. I know it. He just has to."" While admitting that a fourth Bourne film has not been discussed, executive producer Doug Liman agreed that a sidekick character might be worth exploring. Liman wrote in an e-mail Friday that he already had a short list of possible candidates for the role, including Vince Vaughn, John C. Reilly, Luke Wilson, Tim Robbins, Minnie Driver, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Casey Affleck, Don Cheadle, and Adam Sandler.","entertainment, celebrities, movies, friends, optimism, news, vol 43 issue 32, entertainment"

3093,Activision Reports Sluggish Sales For Sousaphone Hero,"SANTA MONICA, CA'Despite a catchy 1890s soundtrack and realistic-feeling game play, Sousaphone Hero, the third installment of Activision's massively popular Guitar Hero video game franchise, sold a mere 52 copies in the United States in its opening week, the company reported Monday. ""In the wake of Guitar Hero's success, we thought the public was more than ready for additional popular American musical genres in a simulated-performance format, but people don't seem to be responding to marches as well as we had hoped,"" said Activision spokeswoman Melissa Hendleman, whose company spent an estimated $25 million developing the game for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii consoles. Sousaphone Hero offers two dozen public-domain marches, including 1893's ""The Liberty Bell,"" 1896's ""Stars and Stripes Forever,"" and 1897's ""Entry of the Gladiators."" The bulky sousaphone-shaped controller coils around the body, and players wear white spat-like foot coverings fitted with sensors that monitor synchronized marching steps. As with the fret buttons on Guitar Hero's guitar peripheral, the sousaphone controller's three valves are color-coded to match on-screen notes the player must hit. Players may also choose from 27 different fat-guy characters who can be customized with Alpine hats, epaulets, and a mustache editor with a wide array of options. Hendleman admitted that the $345 retail price might be a bit steep for many consumers. She also conceded that Activision may have erred by not releasing the game between Memorial Day and July 4, the prime parade season in the United States. Even so, she added, Sousaphone Hero contains ""more than enough"" features to keep gamers absorbed. ""In the career mode, you can rise from playing in park gazebos for church picnics to performing in the halftime show of the Harvard-Yale game,"" Hendleman said. ""If you score enough points, you can unlock the ultimate level: playing in the John Philip Sousa'led Marine Band at Grover Cleveland's inauguration."" ""And if you like multiplayer gaming, you're in luck,"" Hendleman continued. ""In Sousaphone Hero's cooperative marching-band mode, as many as 135 of your friends can play simultaneously."" Hendleman also emphasized the ""fun"" rewards players receive as they become more proficient. If they hit enough correct notes in a row, the on-screen crowd yells ""huzzah"" and ""bully,"" and the sousaphone controller's spit valve will ""drain."" Flubbing notes, however, makes the controller ""fill"" with spit, preventing further play and causing the crowd to throw rotten eggs at the hapless on-screen sousaphonist. If characters earn enough bonus points in career mode, they can spend their Liberty-head nickels on a red, green, or blue ""sock"" for their sousaphone's bell, or an invigorating chunk of peanut brittle. Response to Sousaphone Hero on video-gaming message boards has been tepid at best. ""That controller is like 100 pounds even though its [sic] only plastic,"" wrote mastagamer457, a moderator on one Sousaphone Hero message thread. ""I think I screwed up my shoulder pretty bad."" ""I played the career mode for three hours and kept feeling like I was playing the same annoying circus tune over and over,"" kiLLlah_steVe of Columbus, OH wrote. ""On one song, you're forced to play the same two notes back and forth for 96 measures."" Others have complained that the third valve is used only at the expert level, that even proficient players only score a maximum of 60 points per song, and that the ""oompah"" meter stays the same shade of gray even if every note is hit. Some also reported that, if not cleaned regularly, the plastic mouthpiece gets crusty. Professional sousaphone player Eric Winkler of New Orleans called the game ""laughably amateurish"" and ""nothing like"" the actual sousaphone-playing experience. ""The fingering's completely different, for starters,"" he said. Due to the poor response to Sousaphone Hero, Activision has halted development of spin-off games Cymbal Hero, Glockenspiel Hero, and Steam Calliope Hero.","entertainment, music, trends, video games, news, vol 43 issue 31, entertainment"

3097,No One Sets Out To Be A Smooth Jazz Musician,"Look, I'm not going to lie to you. Nobody ever just woke up one morning and thought, ""Of all the things possible in the vastness that is life, what I'd really like to do is play smooth jazz 250 nights a year."" It just doesn't work that way. It's not something you can plan for'it's all circumstance, I swear: You want to play music for a living. You bust your ass paying your dues in tiny clubs with six people in the audience. You think about all the talented jazz musicians out there who can't make ends meet and you start to worry. The next thing you know, your agent has you filling out forms to legally change your name from Mel Jablonsky to Michael Langello, and it's seeming like a good idea. Then suddenly you're 40 years old and you open up your dresser drawer to find nothing but linen pants. But it starts so innocently. When you sign up for band in the fifth grade, you're upset to learn that the only instrument left is the alto sax, but you decide to make the best of it. You tell yourself, ""This sounds kind of cool, I guess, sort of."" What you could never know is that at that moment you have taken the first step down the long path toward a highly lucrative spot in heavy rotation on every smooth jazz radio station in every dentist's office in the country. So you land a couple gigs at a hotel lobby sitting in for a buddy of yours, just to pay the rent. So what? Then you start picking up hours doing session work because you just found out your wife is pregnant. Big deal. Eventually, you're standing on the deck of some record executive's yacht saying, ""I'd like you to meet my very good friend, Chuck Mangione."" How did this ever happen?  I don't want to sound like I'm complaining. Smooth jazz has been very, very, very good to me. But I can't exactly say I spent 80 hours a week practicing at Juilliard only to play watered-down instrumental versions of innocuous pop songs to audiences composed primarily of over-30 middle-class moms and their husbands. On the other hand, it does bring in $6,000 to $14,000 a night, and, no, Juilliard was not free. I mean, honestly, if one day you're just sitting around sipping coffee on your back deck and you get a call from Windham Hill Records, what are you going to do, not take it? There's worse things that could happen. Obviously, no one ever thought they'd get their chops playing with Miles Davis only so they could one day support Kenny G on the European leg of a world tour, but life is funny that way. Thousands of half-decisions add up over time. Eventually, you grow up a little and give up your dream of an experimental hardcore rock-jazz trio called ""Orbit."" You realize life is a series of compromises. You think, ""Come on, what's wrong with a pleasant blend of jazz and soul that people might enjoy listening to at home, possibly for a night of romance? That never killed nobody."" Then you wake up from a daydream to find yourself sitting on top of a piano on a beach in the Caribbean, wearing a loose-fitting white shirt, with photographers all around you, and you don't have any idea how you got there. For a moment you're terrified, and then it all comes flooding back: the new album, the road trips, the lunch meetings, the Grammy for best children's album. And then, well, then you're just left with yourself. But the truth is, I'm fine with the fact that 52 years of professional jazz experience boils down to a few secretaries typing a little faster when my song comes on the radio. Really. The one thing I can't get over is when people at my shows yell out requests for ""Yah Mo Be There."" That's Michael McDonald, for Christ's sake, and I happen to know even he hates that song. It's eating him alive to have to crank that one out night after night. But c'est la vie. You just give the booking agent your direct-deposit routing number, and you soldier on. I promise you, there was never a single, defining moment when I realized there was a huge market of people out there who only own four records, and convinced myself that, dammit, mine could be one of those four. Why would I? Fact is, I can't think of even one musician currently on the circuit who intentionally chose to go into smooth jazz, except maybe David Sanborn. But even he got to play some rock and free jazz earlier in his career and get it out of his system.  But like I said, I'm not complaining. Nobody held a gun to my head when I recorded that album with George Benson last year. That was all me. Two and a half hours in the studio turned into a much-needed kitchen renovation and a new Prius. And it makes people happy. After all, that's what it's all about, isn't it? Right? Isn't it?","opinion, entertainment, music, jobs, commentary, vol 43 issue 30, michael langello, entertainment"

3101,"No One Admits To Singing, Writing, Producing Nation's No. 1 Song","LOS ANGELES'As of Monday, the CD single ""Baby Baby (Luvya Girl)"" has rocketed to the top of the Billboard Hot 100 on its debut week, despite the fact no one has claimed credit for singing, composing, or producing it. The single's success marks a rare occasion in which both critics and the music industry find themselves in agreement, as magazines such as Spin call ""Baby Baby"" ""a wasteland"" and ""creatively brain-dead,"" and major recording labels such as Interscope and Sony BMG distance themselves from it. ""This is a first in modern recording history,"" Billboard Magazine writer Jim Shapiro said. ""Even third-place American Idol contestants and Diddy have not come forward as the creators, though it's obviously a solid hit and could make them a lot of bank."" Receiving heavy rotation on terrestrial Top 40 stations, the R&B-infused tune clocks in at just under two minutes and 45 seconds. The song's main, and sole, lyrics, ""Baby, baby, Luvya girl,"" are sung in a breathy male voice that alternates between a grunt and a falsetto. A cooing female voice vaguely simulating an orgasm provides the bridge at approximately the 1:50 mark. Even seasoned music journalists and A&R executives are having difficulty identifying the voices, saying it's anyone's guess whom they belong to. ""Justin Timberlake, Usher, Beyoncé, Fergie, Ludacris, Rihanna'you tell me,"" said Jive Records executive Scott Giordano, who strongly denied any responsibility for ""Baby Baby."" ""The wispy whine of the female's voice sounded a bit like Britney Spears doing a comeback attempt'the tune certainly seemed up her alley'but she sounded black, so then I considered that 'Milkshake' girl. But really, I can't tell. I'd bet the guy's not R. Kelly, but then again, I've worked in this business for 15 years and I'm still not sure what he sounds like."" Billboard itself encountered some unexpected difficulties when assigning a nameless chart credit to the song. After several abortive attempts, the song was finally credited to ""Anonymous."" The ""Anonymous"" designation was chosen after ? of ? and the Mysterians, John Doe, and the rest of the band X threatened libel suits against the magazine. The song debuted in clubs in December, then began to receive airplay on urban radio the next month. Confusion grew as the song was released to stores earlier this month in a featureless jewel case. ""My best guess is that it was some long-shelved track from The Neptunes' vaults and somebody released it as a joke,"" said DeeDee Eisen, a Sony BMG talent executive who also claimed she ""in no way had anything to do"" with the song. ""But even their least-inspired work is a hundred times better than this."" Nor has the ""Baby Baby"" music video which debuted last week on MTV2 and Fuse cleared up the creators' identity. The lead singer appears to be male, with his head obscured by a bandanna. He alternately hides his face with his gloved hands, a microphone, a bottle of Cristal champagne, and a sign reading ""Luvya Girl."" Even the dancers' faces are heavily pixilated, though their booties are not. ""Because no label has claimed credit for the song, we don't even know who made the video,"" Fuse vice president of Programming Keith DeSonas said. ""For all we know, it was some kids having fun."" Music journalists have also been frustrated in their attempts to track down information about the song, which has not been registered and licensed with either the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP) or Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI). ""Poring over months of booking schedules from dozens of recording studios nationwide has yielded nothing,"" Rolling Stone writer Paul Romkin said. ""Not even MySpace, a sort of last refuge for the musically damned, has shed any light on the identity of 'Baby Baby's' makers."" Longtime music industry giants said the situation cannot be an easy one for those responsible for ""Baby Baby."" ""On one hand there is so much money to be made from this song,"" veteran music executive Clive Davis said. ""Royalties alone could net these people millions, and a full album and summer concert tour would really put them on the map. True, it would be humiliating to stand in front of people and sing this kind of drivel, but it certainly wouldn't be the first time people have swallowed their pride for money."" Continued Davis: ""Somewhere out there, there are some folks who are deeply, deeply ashamed of what they've done. And after hearing a few seconds of that song, I can't really say that I blame them.""","entertainment, music, trends, scandal, summer music, news, vol 43 issue 29, entertainment"

Hold on'the tall lanky one is having a comically physical overreaction to a situation that hardly calls for it!

According to police reports, 28-year-old marketing research assistant Louis Bowen walked into the small Italian restaurant Occhiuto's at approximately 7:40 p.m. and headed directly toward Gandolfini's table. Bowen then drew a snub-nosed .38 revolver from his jacket and shot Gandolfini point-blank in the head three times before dropping the gun and calmly exiting the eatery. Bowen was apprehended two blocks away by two NYPD officers and reportedly put up no resistance. ""I couldn't let it just hang,"" Bowen told police in a post-arrest confession released to the media. ""Eight years of my life, and a fucking artsy cut to black? It was eating me up inside."" In his statement, Bowen also used the word ""betrayal"" to describe the series's resolution, which he was convinced set up a climactic death for the sociopathic mafia don. The realization that Soprano's brutal life of constant fear and anxiety would have no real end slowly drove the obsessed Bowen over the edge. ""I had to tie up the loose ends, I just had to,"" Bowen said. ""I'm positive this is exactly how [creator and executive producer] David Chase wanted fans to interpret the ending."" NYPD spokesman Charles Krann expressed regret over the Gandolfini slaying, saying that law enforcement ""should have known this was coming,"" considering the heavy foreshadowing of impending doom in The Sopranos'  final season and the lack of payoff. ""The symbolism and dialogue clearly conveyed an ominous sense of death and decay,"" Krann said. ""Particularly the scene in the second-to-last episode where Tony and his brother-in-law talk about death. So for Bowen, murdering the actor brought a kind of justice."" ""It probably would have all been different had there been a realistic chance of a Sopranos movie,"" Krann added. Gandolfini's murder comes in the wake of several recent attempts on the actor's life following the airing of the series finale, which included a car bomb that exploded when he remote-started his car, and an attempted garroting while he rode in the front seat of a cab. Though the star is mourned by millions, many expressed relief that Tony Soprano's saga is definitively over. ""Thank God it finally happened,"" said Lenox Hill Hospital general surgery resident David Kinsky, who was sitting at a table adjacent to Gandolfini's at the time of the murder. ""I just knew that was how the story was meant to end. After the finale, I was so anxious and depressed I could hardly sleep."" Yet other eyewitnesses characterized Gandolfini's death as ""predictable,"" ""cheap,"" and ""devoid of imagination."" ""I'm an intelligent person'I didn't need to be spoon-fed an ending like this,"" Occhiuto's bartender Kim Romano said. ""The killer obviously didn't get that the finale was meant to show Tony doomed to live out his violent gangland existence in an infinite, monotonous loop. Like the Journey song at the end said, 'It goes on and on and on and on.'"" Ironically, far from satisfactorily resolving the fate of Tony Soprano, Gandolfini's brutal slaying will most likely only intensify the controversy among fans, and will serve as prime water-cooler discussion material for days, if not weeks, to come. In a late-night City Hall press conference, New York mayor Michael Bloomberg refused to comment on the killing. ""No, no, don't tell me what happened,"" said Bloomberg, hastily plugging his ears. ""I TiVo'ed the last six episodes but I've been too busy to watch them. No spoilers, please.""","entertainment, crime, media, television, news, vol 43 issue 26, entertainment"
3108,Open-Minded Music Lover Likes All Kinds Of Metal,"LOGANSPORT, IN'Area music enthusiast Curt Webber, 22, is completely open to enjoying ""all kinds"" of metal, the self-described eclectic iconoclast said Monday. ""Some people are so narrow-minded and uptight about music, but I'm into a wide variety of bands'everything from Sabbath to Disturbed,"" Webber said. ""Whether it's the old stuff, like vintage Maiden or Priest; new stuff, like Mastodon or the Sword; the virtuosic neoclassicism of DragonForce; the unpolished rawness of, say, Motörhead; a multiplatinum band like the Crüe; an alternative act like Clutch; or just a local outfit like Soldiers of Carnage here in town'power metal, speed metal, glam metal, thrash metal, death metal, nü metal, metal-core, or even Norwegian black metal'it's all music to me, man.""

3115,"Unconventional Director Sets Shakespeare Play In Time, Place Shakespeare Intended","MORRISTOWN, NJ'In an innovative, tradition-defying rethinking of one of the greatest comedies in the English language, Morristown Community Players director Kevin Hiles announced Monday his bold intention to set his theater's production of William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice in 16th-century Venice. ""I know when most people hear The Merchant Of Venice, they think 1960s Las Vegas, a high-powered Manhattan stock brokerage, or an 18th-century Georgia slave plantation, but I think it's high time to shake things up a bit,"" Hiles said. ""The great thing about Shakespeare is that the themes in his plays are so universal that they can be adapted to just about any time and place."" According to Hiles, everything in the production will be adapted to the unconventional setting. Swords will replace guns, ducats will be used instead of the American dollar or Japanese yen, and costumes, such as Shylock's customary pinstripe suit, general's uniform, or nudity, will be replaced by garb of the kind worn by Jewish moneylenders of the Italian Renaissance. ""Audiences may be taken aback initially by the lack of Creole accents,"" Hiles said. ""But I think if they pay close enough attention, they'll recognize that all the metaphors, similes, and puns remain firmly intact, maybe even more so, in the Elizabethan dialect."" Added Hiles: ""After all, a pound of flesh is a pound of flesh, whether you're trying to woo a lady in 16th-century Europe, or you're a high school senior trying to impress your girlfriend with a limo ride to the prom, like in the last Merchant production MCP did in '95."" Though Hiles, 48, is a veteran regional- theater director with extensive Shakespeare experience, he said he has never taken such an unconventional departure. The Community Players' 1999 production of Othello was set during the first Gulf War, 2001's The Tempest took place on a canoe near the Bermuda Triangle, and last year's ""stripped- down,"" post-apocalyptic version of Hamlet presented the tragedy in the year 3057. Hiles said he became drawn to the prospect of setting the play in such an unorthodox locale while casually rereading the play early last year. He noticed that Venice was mentioned several times in the text, not only in character dialogue, but also in italics just before the first character speaks. After doing some additional research, Hiles also learned that 16th-century Europe was a troubled and tumultuous region plagued by a great intolerance toward Jews, historical context which could serve as the social backdrop for the play's central conflict. ""Even the names just sort of fell into place,"" said Hiles, who had been planning to center the play around an al-Qaeda terrorist cell before going with an avant-garde take. ""Theater is about taking risks, and I'm really excited to meet this newest challenge."" Some of Hiles' actors, however, have reacted negatively to his decision. Some are worried Hiles lacks the knowledge and talent to pull off the radical revisionist interpretation, while others characterized it as ""self-indulgent."" ""I guess it's the director's dramatic license to put his own personal spin on the play he is directing, but this is a little over-the-top,"" said Stacey Silverman, who played Nurse Brutus in Hiles' 2003 all-female version of Julius Caesar. ""I just think Portia not being an aviatrix does a tremendous disservice to the playwright."" Added Silverman: ""You just don't mess with a classic.""","entertainment, trends, history, culture, news, vol 43 issue 22, entertainment"

'It was painful to read,' Wiesel said of the story of his journey from his childhood home to the Nazi death camp Auschwitz. 'I know every great author says they hate their first book, but frankly, I'm embarrassed this ever made it into print. The sentence structure is artless, the plot is repetitive at best'and the constant mentioning of how I felt abandoned by God? What was the point of all that?' Wiesel said that, although Night is not his only work that deals with his personal experience of the Holocaust, it is by far his 'most humiliating.' 'I got so wrapped up in what I was writing, I couldn't separate myself from the subject matter,' said Wiesel, adding that the eight-page account of the train ride from Gleiwitz to Buchenwald could have been trimmed down considerably to focus on the essential events. 'I just assumed everything about my life was so fascinating, people would want to read about it. I was so naEove.' Wiesel went on to criticize Night for lacking the subtlety of his later writings, claiming the use of foreshadowing was predictable and the description of the harrowing gas chamber selection process felt 'clichEidEflike bad daytime TV melodrama.'

3128,Why Was I Not Informed About Bruce Lee?,"I am going to try to remain calm and keep in mind that you purport to be decent, rational people. As my parents and peers, you supposedly have my best interests at heart. But over the past 80 minutes, it has come to my attention that there exists a series of films featuring a man capable of the most unbridled and elegant awesomeness, a man capable of knocking a guy out with a punch started one inch away from his enemy's chest. That I somehow reached my twelfth year of life without anyone alerting me to this fact is beyond my comprehension and, ultimately, inexcusable. I have always tried to present myself as the type of person who enjoys watching dudes fight other dudes with iron claws. In the past, many of you have possessed the presence of mind and shown the consideration to inform me about firecrackers, battling robots, and guns that shoot paint'and I appreciate that. But in no way does that justify the fact that you have hidden from me the very information which may be most crucial to my existence: that a man named Bruce Lee can break a guy's leg and arm in two punches and then snap his neck with one arm. These past 12 years have been an utter waste. Do I not look like a person who would benefit from the knowledge that Bruce Lee actually asks people to kick him in the face? How am I to believe anyone cares about me at all when it is the year 2007 and I have only just now, for the first time, watched this man clench his fists and crack all the bones in his body? The matter of Bruce Lee and his incredible kick-assness should have been brought to my attention months'nay, years'ago. If by no one else, then at least by my parents, who have an obligation to provide me with food, water, and shelter, as well as to make sure I am kept fully abreast of any awesome guys who can punch so fast it's like they have 40 fists. Is this not their responsibility as my guardians and role models? God only knows what long-term effects their negligence will have on me. The tragedy is, it would have been such an easy thing to do. Someone could have simply sat me down and said to me in a calm, clear voice, ""Sam, Bruce Lee can whip nunchucks around like a hundred times per second."" I could have taken it from there. But for some reason that I cannot fathom, I was kept in the dark. I have been going to school and playing outside with my friends, and all the while I could have been sitting at home watching someone do a one-handed push-up using only two fingers. And he can. I've seen it, and it's beyond awesome. But Bruce Lee's unquestionable awesomeness is hardly the issue here. I have witnessed him taste his own blood from a wound and then go nuts on this one guy, so it's not up for debate. You say you love me, and yet there is a man who can jump like four feet into the air and kick a guy five times before landing'and you kept it from me. That can hardly be called love. Perhaps you took some kind of sick joy in my ignorance. Maybe all of you have formed a regular gathering of some kind to share a hearty laugh at silly little 12-year-old Sammy Potts, who still thinks Chuck Norris is cool, when there exists in this world another, better guy who actually kills Chuck Norris in one of his movies. Oh, how you must have laughed. Let me make one thing perfectly clear to avoid any misunderstandings like this in the future: If you know of any men who can casually stand on live cobras while sending a telegram, or scissor kick a dude who's still hanging onto his foot, alert me immediately. Now if you'll excuse me, I must go repeatedly tell everyone I know.","opinion, entertainment, kids, movies, asia, commentary, vol 43 issue 20, sammy potts, entertainment"

3134,CBS To Release Own Version Of NBC's The Office,"NEW YORK'Hoping to replicate the success of the Emmy-winning NBC show The Office, executives at CBS announced Monday that the network will adapt the highly rated comedy for CBS audiences. ""We're excited to bring the fresh, groundbreaking comedy of The Office to a completely new channel,"" CBS President Leslie Moonves said. ""Some people say a show like The Office can only work on NBC, but we're out to prove them wrong."" Since securing rights to the sitcom, producers Bruce Klein and Greg Winston have worked diligently to repackage the show for its new context. ""We're huge fans of NBC's The Office'we want to remain faithful to that while at the same time creating our own voice,"" Klein said. ""Obviously we had to change some of the language and cultural references to things our audience will understand. But the show's central message is the same: Just because they call it 'work' doesn't mean you can't have a few laughs while doing it."" The show's pilot, a shot-for-shot re-creation of NBC's Office pilot, features comedian David Spade as boss Peter Craig, the fun-loving and inspirational boss of a small-town Ohio paper company. ""Having David on the project is such a thrill,"" said Klein, who offered Spade the part after Ray Romano and Kevin James turned down the role. ""Don't get me wrong'Steve Carell is great, but David's combination of zippy one-liners and all-out zaniness just can't be beat."" The remake will also feature the same will-they-won't-they love story between a plain-looking receptionist engaged to a man from the company's warehouse who doesn't appreciate her, and a perfectly suited coworker who pines for her from afar. But producers at CBS said the love triangle will be ""completely revamped"" for the new series, as new names have been created for all three characters. ""The budding romance between Jen and Tom is really the foundation of the show,"" said director Howard Gatson, who has made their connection ""more believable"" by casting more traditionally attractive actors in the roles. ""People are going to tune in every week to see if Jen will ever leave her fiancé to be with Tom. And they'll be so relieved when she finally does in episode three."" The producers made several other changes to the show in order to promote a greater crossover appeal. The faux-documentary format has been dropped in favor of a traditional three-camera setup, and a laugh track has been added to fill in any painful, awkward pauses in dialogue that might slow down the show. ""We're very excited about the ripped-from-the-headlines feel of [assistant to the manager] Dwayne's backstory as an Iraq War veteran,"" Klein said. ""It will give his character some of the authority and gravity that [NBC's] Dwight is lacking."" Fans of the original NBC version and several TV critics have expressed doubt as to whether the show's dry, subtle humor can be interpreted for an entirely different channel. ""These NBC imports have failed time and time again to make the leap to other networks,"" Washington Post entertainment reporter Deborah Landon wrote. ""Just look what happened when CBS tried to adapt the failed half season of NBC's Coupling."" ""You can't just take a show that good, throw in a new set of actors, and expect the same results,"" said Jennie Tan, who runs a popular fansite for the NBC show. ""CBS just has to accept that there will simply never be another character like Michael Scott, ever."" Despite early public skepticism, CBS executives remain confident the program will be a cross-network hit. They have already commissioned two 12-episode seasons of the reworked sitcom, tentatively titled The Office, and slotted the show for their most competitive time slot, Thursdays at 8:30 p.m. ""We're not afraid to put our version of The Office against the most popular shows out there,"" Moonves said. ""It's something totally unique and different, and frankly, there's nothing else like it on CBS.""","entertainment, jobs, television, coworkers, united kingdom, news, vol 43 issue 18, entertainment"
3135,"If Someone Wanted To Publish My Blog Entries For Money, I Wouldn't Say No","Let me make one thing clear right off the bat: I started my blog because I needed an outlet for my thoughts and feelings during the 2004 elections, not for the prestige and loyal readership it might bring me. I just needed a personal creative space where I could jot some things down that someone might be able to Google. Now, if my friends happen to read my blog, great. If they e-mail others about it, fantastic. If people I don't even know check it out'and according to my hit counter, as many as 62 a day have'so much the better. And if, say, Harper's, Rolling Stone, or any other publication ever wanted to publish some of my blog entries for money, I guess that's their prerogative. My blog is more of a hobby than anything else, something to do for fun when I get home from my bookstore job. I've never dreamed of making a living from it. Though hypothetically speaking, if The New Yorker'a publication that I'm sure pays top dollar'wanted to publish my August 9, 2005 post ""Creative Thinking Spots"" in its ""Shouts And Murmurs"" section, I'd consider it. Didn't cross my mind when I wrote that post, and that's certainly not why I wrote it, nor why I have a Google news alert set up for New Yorker  editor David Remnick, but I can understand how someone on their staff might think the piece is a good fit for that section.  The No. 1 rule of my blog is that there are no rules. I write about everything from movies I've seen to crazy observations that just pop into my head about Starbucks. And sometimes I'll just write, ""Had a pretty boring day today,"" take a picture of myself eating cereal for dinner, and call it a night. It's a web log, people. I'm not striving to be a great essayist, but if by chance some amazing commentary flows out of my keyboard, so be it. I don't write my blog to entertain anyone else, especially not some uptight Esquire editor. But if an Esquire editor is crazy about my work, and wants to run a three-page spread on my hilarious reviews of horrible movies, who am I to dismiss it out of hand?   If the Old Media bigwigs ever do decide to visit my blog (http://bentiedemanntellsall.blogspot.com) they would see it doesn't have that familiar opportunistic ""look at me, look at me"" feel of so many others. They'd see I'm just a small-town guy, humbly making his way in the big city, who happens to have a lot of unique and humorous outsider perspectives on that experience. For example, I got a few comments (from as far away as Boise!) on how interesting my post was about how in my hometown of Akron everyone is really laid-back, but in New York City, everyone is always on edge. I could see how these types of entries could be adapted into a syndicated column with a title like ""Small Town Takes A Bite From Big Apple"" that could run in a dozen papers. Though I'm not one to put myself out there and try to initiate these things, I wouldn't turn my nose up at them either. Some of you are thinking that I'm just a sellout. But the true sellouts are blogs like Daily Kos and Talking Points Memo that blatantly rely on advertising. Sellouts are bandwagon bloggers like my colleague AudreyGrrrl, who recently got written up in Wired as one of the best bloggers under 30. Have I spent the last three and a half years trying to get profiled in Wired? No. Do I think some of my daily musings, such as the times I've blogged about missing the bus, are more interesting than the entries posted by those so called ""best bloggers""? Yes. But blogging shouldn't be a competition. It's not about getting published in an anthology with a foreword by David Foster Wallace and going on a 30-stop book tour. I don't need that kind of attention. AudreyGrrrl might, but not me.  Look, if I wanted to be a ""professional"" print writer, I could easily do it. Last week I posted a very insightful piece on why Saturday Night Live is emerging from the bleak shadows of the past several years and may be on the cusp of experiencing a renaissance. Nearly three of the seven people who commented on the posting said they could envision the piece being published in the New York Times' Arts & Leisure section. Hey, I didn't say it, they did. And to be honest, by the looks of the section, they could use some new blood over there. Just saying. I'm not some pathetic, lonely soul who sits in front of his computer refreshing his e-mail in hopes that somebody from HarperCollins, Three Rivers Press, or Random House will offer me a book deal. In fact, to prove how little I'm expecting from the blog career-wise, I'm taking the next few weeks off to focus on my spec script for Two And A Half Men'which I'm doing strictly for the practice, you understand. I could care less if it lands me an agent and a three-movie deal with Paramount. I'm just doing this for me, after all.","opinion, entertainment, people, culture, old internet, commentary, vol 45 issue 01, ben tiedemann, entertainment"

3139,"'This American Life' Completes Documentation Of Liberal, Upper-Middle-Class Existence","CHICAGO'Producers of the long-running Chicago Public Radio program This American Life announced Monday that they have completed their comprehensive 12-year survey of life as a modern upper-middle-class American. In what cultural anthropologists are calling a ""colossal achievement"" in the study of white-collar professionals, the popular radio show has successfully isolated all 7,442 known characteristics of college graduates who earn between $62,500 and $125,000 per year and feel strongly that something should be done about global warming. ""We've done it,"" said senior producer Julie Snyder, who was personally interviewed for a 2003 This American Life episode, ""Going Eclectic,"" in which she described what it's like to be a bilingual member of the ACLU trained in kite-making by a Japanese stepfather. ""There is not a single existential crisis or self-congratulatory epiphany that has been or could be experienced by a left-leaning agnostic that we have not exhaustively documented and grouped by theme."" Added Snyder, ""We here at public radio couldn't be more pleased with ourselves."" The final episode, which explored the universal tribulations of having to live with roommates again in one's mid-30s after a divorce, provided an apt bookend for the project. The completed work is expected to be an indispensable source of information for years to come about the thoughts and tastes of bespectacled cynics prone to neuroses who are actually doing just fine. This American Life host and producer Ira Glass began work on the project in 1995 in Chicago, where he found himself inspired by and catering to an audience of professionals who dine out frequently and have a hard time getting angry. Glass and his team of producers, writers, and interns set about the exhausting task of gathering all available information on a range of subjects from minor skirmishes with the law to the rewards of occasionally talking to poor people. The raw data was then analyzed, deconstructed, reconstructed, re-deconstructed, organized under a broad philosophical title, and interspliced with musical interludes by rock duo They Might Be Giants. Though This American Life is now lauded as the definitive source for material about getting an autistic teenager admitted to Harvard, its early run was marked by painful trial-and-error, according to producer Alex Blumberg. ""At first, we were getting a lot of stories from recovered drug addicts and East African refugees living in the States, which had their compelling elements but came off a bit cloying,"" Blumberg said. ""But then we realized that if we had overeducated people with voices rather unsuitable for radio narrate the stories with clever analogies and accessible morals, the whole thing would come off far less depressing."" Blumberg said that the turning point came in 1997, when producers discovered a group of inner-city schoolchildren inadvertently teaching an important lesson to their attractive, suburban-raised teacher about what makes us human. Also aiding the study were the many contributors to This American Life, who took time from their best-selling essay-writing careers to donate personal anecdotes about dropping out of prestigious art schools, taking harrowing but poignant childhood vacations to the Grand Canyon, and the unique challenges of growing up in families supportive of their homosexuality. On Sunday, writer and contributing editor Sarah Vowell called the project's end ""oddly anticlimactic,"" but questioned whether work was actually complete because the show had not yet addressed the subject of ""Things Ending."" ""Seeing this project through to its culmination was equally satisfying and strange,"" said Vowell, speaking at a book signing in Colonial Williamsburg dressed as Betsy Ross. ""I feel not unlike the early Pilgrims, who, standing atop Plymouth Rock after a long and arduous sea voyage, reflected on their journey, perhaps thinking to themselves 'For God's sake'doesn't anybody have anything to eat in this settlement?'"" Glass, who personally contributed over 2,000 anecdotes from his own life for documentation, called the project's conclusion the ""end of an era."" ""When we finished, I have to tell you, I felt something I never expected: a profound sense of contentment'maybe even relief,"" Glass said. ""Afterwards, the other producers and I sat around for a long while, remarking on how interesting and strange it was to finally complete the study, and how perhaps it is, in some way, symbolic of life in general.""","entertainment, patriotism, media, culture, news, vol 46 issue 26, entertainment"

3146,New Disney Ride Simulates Disney'ABC Merger,"ORLANDO, FL'Visitors to the Walt Disney World theme park stood in line for hours Monday waiting to get on the Whirly Merge, a new thrill ride that promises all the excitement of the 1996 merger between the Walt Disney Company and Capital Cities/ABC, Disney officials said Wednesday. 'This ride has been 12 years in the making,' Disney CEO Bob Iger said. 'Now you can experience for yourself the heart-stopping suspense when [former Disney chief] Michael Eisner tries to convince the board of directors to diversify its holdings and become the world's largest entertainment conglomerate.' Described in a Disney press release as 'It's A Small World and Space Mountain meets Barbarians At The Gate,' the Whirly Merge transports its riders, who are strapped in plush leather chairs to 'boardroom tables,' through a series of fast-paced and intricate business meetings, all leading to the climactic acquisition stage. Riders are led by Roy Disney, nephew of Walt Disney and a longtime Disney executive and major shareholder, whose disembodied voice guides them through the experience via a speakerphone in the middle of the table. The voice recounts how in the early 1990s, 'a time of legend and magic,' the company was flush with profits from its animated film successes The Lion King and Beauty And The Beast. As holographic accountants dance in giant piles of cash, Michael Eisner conceives a plan to invest the money rather than pay exorbitant taxes on the new windfall. The boardroom table then takes a plunge into Herb Allen's media conference, where Eisner has put feelers out to see if either ABC or CBS is in a vulnerable position that Disney can leverage for a buyout. Figures like investor Warren Buffett and former Disney president Michael Ovitz lunge forward unexpectedly, but before riders can gather their bearings, the boardroom table plummets in an 80-foot 'Due Diligence Drop.' Riders are also treated to a dizzying laser-light e-mail exchange and a lightning-speed courier chase as they spin down the seemingly endless 'Paper Trail.' 'The Imagineers really outdid themselves this time,' Iger said. 'With so much attention to vivid detail, the Whirly Merge gives riders something new every time, from the subtle pink dots on the lawyers' power ties to the Dolby Digital Surround Sound'generated whoosh of legal-pad pages in your ear.' 'And was that me in the background of the shareholder announcement?' Iger added. 'You'll just have to ride again to find out.' Park-goers clamored to get their pictures taken with the distinctive Whirly Merge characters, who roam the grounds in their trademark business suits and oversized heads. Meanwhile, Disney Stores nationwide reported that they have already sold out their stock of suit-patterned Whirly Merge T-shirts and Iger-themed stuffed plush toys. The ride is getting a thumbs-up from perhaps the toughest critics of all: young children. 'I loved the part where they were integrating the databases,' 9-year-old Pattie Dahm said. 'And just when you thought it was all worked out, there was that system crash that lost tons of important corporate information and employee e-mail. It was so cool.' 'The [boardroom] shake-up was really scary,' Tyler James, 10, said. 'I felt a little sick during the arbitrage part, but I still want to go again!' The attraction has already proven popular enough to start production on a major motion picture, as well as a straight-to-DVD release, Walt & Son, a lighthearted animated reworking of the relationship between brash and spunky ABC and its parent company Disney. A sequel ride which details the ouster of Michael Eisner as CEO is rumored to be opening in 2009.","entertainment, business, disney, family, finance, news, vol 43 issue 13, entertainment"
3147,Anna Nicole Smith Finally Reaches Target Weight,"NASSAU, BAHAMAS'Former stripper turned Playboy Playmate turned reality-TV star Anna Nicole Smith has overcome her longtime struggle with obesity, at last reaching her target weight of 125 pounds, sources said Monday. ""Anna's been through a lot,"" said Florida Circuit Court Judge Larry Seidlin, who became visibly emotional as he spoke to reporters. ""But I think it's fair to say that she hasn't been this happy in years."" Forensics reports reveal that Smith's miraculous weight loss began on Feb. 8, when she was discovered unconscious in her Hollywood, FL hotel room. She then proceeded to shed the baby weight she had gained during her recent pregnancy, even as her numerous legal woes and the controversy surrounding her 6-month-old daughter Dannielynn's paternity thrust Smith into the public eye more than ever before. ""The last several weeks have been particularly rough for Anna, but thankfully she's turned a corner,"" said attorney Richard Millstein, the legally appointed guardian for Dannielynn. ""At least some good has come out of this sad and sordid tale."" Several sources close to Smith confirmed that she did have some work done in the intervening weeks, losing a significant amount of weight after doctors removed several pounds of her internal organs for toxicity tests. Others credit the loss to aggressive calorie cutting. Broward County Chief Medical Examiner Joshua Perper said Smith ""slowly and steadily"" shed the excess pounds before closing in on her goal in the past week. ""Those last 20 pounds were the hardest,"" Perper said. ""But God bless her, she did it. Finally, after all that struggle, she's in a good place."" Some weight-loss experts, however, see Smith's achievement as less than inspirational, claiming that such drastic crash dieting can cause the body to lose dangerous amounts of water and muscle mass. ""She can't be healthy,"" Miami-based dietitian Pam Archer said. ""From what I understand, her current appearance is, frankly, frightening. Even though she's reached her target, her weight is continuing to drop at an alarming pace. Pretty soon she'll be nothing but skin and bones."" Despite such criticism, Krista Barth, attorney for Smith's common-law husband Howard K. Stern, defended Smith. ""While we don't claim to be entirely pleased with the outcome of the events of the past several weeks, if nothing else, she finally lost the weight, and nobody, not even an appeals court, can take that away from her,"" Barth said. ""Anna Nicole deserves full credit for finally getting what she always wanted."" Smith is currently celebrating her new slimmed-down status in the Bahamas, where she is expected to remain indefinitely.","entertainment, health, celebrities, fitness, scandal, news, vol 43 issue 13, entertainment"

3151,Actress' Abortion Written Into TV Show,"CULVER CITY, CA'Writers of a popular prime-time CBS sitcom spent the last three weeks making late-stage script adjustments to work its female lead's recent abortion into its storyline, sources close to the show revealed Monday. In the upcoming episode of Same Difference, taped late last week and scheduled to air in May, star Kirsten Sumner's character, Trish O'Connell, the sharp-tongued but beautiful wife of portly Chicago bread-truck driver Greg O'Connell, played by Carl Hubbard, will reveal to her husband she was pregnant and had an abortion without his knowledge. Trish's revelation comprises the secondary, or ""B,"" story of the episode, in which Greg eats a meatball sandwich against his wife's wishes. ""It would've been insulting to our viewers if we never addressed the fact that Kirsten is so obviously post-abortion,"" executive producer Aaron Karsch said. ""We did consider shooting around the abortion and using lighting tricks and strategically placed plants to cover up her uterus. But everyone would have been able to tell anyhow, so we figured we might as well use it to the show's advantage."" Sumner, who decided to terminate her pregnancy after several weeks of emotional deliberation, reportedly informed the show's executive producers about it earlier this month. Though the abortion posed a significant challenge for Same Difference's 12 writers, who were given the task of addressing it in a way that would not disrupt the show's lighthearted pace or contradict Sumner's on-screen persona, Karsch said such developments ""come with the territory."" ""When you're writing a successful sitcom, sometimes the actors' personal lives find a way to creep on set and you just have to adapt,"" Karsch said. ""Kirsten's around that age when a lot of actresses start thinking about having abortions, so I guess it's not that surprising."" After viewing the rough edits of the new scenes, Karsch said he ""couldn't be happier"" with the decision to include Sumner's abortion in the show, and expects the episode will be Same Difference's most popular since ""High Definition,"" a 2002 episode in which Greg bought a big-screen TV. ""It wasn't easy, but in the end, we got some very solid material out of it'the plotline stayed true to the O'Connells' relationship while still being entertaining,"" said co- executive producer Larry Krespie, adding that, thanks to the show's resourceful writing staff, Sumner's evacuated womb may be ""the best thing that ever happened to Same Difference."" Despite his initial skepticism about how the new abortion storyline would play to the female 36 to 49 demographic, Krespie was ultimately won over after viewing the rough edits. ""Kirsten did some brilliant acting,"" said Krespie, who called Sumner's portrayal of a woman who had recently had an abortion ""spot-on."" ""Our show does a lot of quiet, observational humor, and I think anyone who's had an abortion would be hard-pressed not to relate to, and get a chuckle out of, Trish's situation."" Continued Krespie: ""Kirsten really got into the mind of her character, even in the physical-comedy scenes, like when she was trying to avoid Greg and get out of the house to get the abortion. And later in the packed abortion clinic, when she mistakes the number 81 she received from the receptionist for 18, and finds out she has to wait much longer for her abortion. But it all leads to a nice, poignant ending when both characters realize they should have been honest with each other all along'Trish with her pregnancy, and Greg with his sandwich.""","entertainment, health, relationships, tv, news, vol 43 issue 11, entertainment"

3153,Unreleased Jimmy Page Guitar Riff To Be Retrieved From Secret Vault To Save Rock And Roll,"GWYNEDD, WALES'Calling it the planet's last, best hope for saving rock music, the Guardians of the Protectorate of Rock announced Monday that they would take the extraordinary step of unleashing a never-before-heard Jimmy Page riff, hidden for decades in a mythic, impenetrable vault. ""We who believe in the immortality of rock took a vow 30 years ago that we would never release this incredibly powerful force unless we faced a Day of Reckoning'and that day has come,"" said Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi, one of the chosen few who helped forge the Secret Vault to Save Rock and Roll, at a press conference in the Welsh highlands. ""Just look at the pop charts, and you shall know I speak the truth."" ""Let's give rock and roll its fucking balls back,"" he added. The Guardians said recent developments in the music world, such as the unaccountable popularity of the Dixie Chicks and Sufjan Stevens, have created a ""perfect storm of lameness"" from which rock might never recover. While Iommi refused to say when the vault would be opened, hard rock sources believe it will take place just prior to next month's Fall Out Boy'Honda Civic tour, which many fear will suck the remaining lifeblood from all that still rocks. ""Citizens of Rock, we refuse to stand idly by any longer,"" ZZ Top founder and Protectorate High Elder Billy Gibbons said. ""When a puss like James Blunt is allowed to rule the airwaves, we must respond by exposing this monster riff, and blowing minds into the stratosphere."" The Protectorate, devoted to the preservation of badass jams and blistering guitar solos, was reportedly formed in the 1970s during the rise of adult contemporary music. According to legend, the riff, played only once by Page and recorded on a special cobalt record, contains the raw power, mind-blowing skill, and unbridled passion of all the Guardians combined. Recently translated parchments from the era describe it as a soul-searing power-chord progression faintly resembling a cross between ""Smoke On The Water"" and ""Living Loving Maid,"" but ""basically defying all description."" It is believed that, upon the riff's release, even those who claim that the genre is dead will have no choice but to pump their fists, bang their heads, and bow down to the gods of rock for all eternity. ""May God have mercy on our souls for what we are going to set loose upon the world,"" proclaimed Queen guitarist Brian May, dressed in druidic robes and bathed in the rising blue smoke of a nearby fog machine. ""Will it save rock or destroy mankind? We have no way of knowing'yet we have no other choice."" Members of the Protectorate were each given only partial information about the location of the vault, which they were instructed to open in unison only in the event of a total Rockopalypse. While some believed the vault was buried in Boston, Chicago, Kansas, Europe, or Asia, others claimed it could be found in the Court of the Crimson King. However, after piecing together clues hidden in Yes album covers and Pink Floyd liner notes, rock historians now believe the riff is locked away deep beneath the Welsh countryside house known as Bron-Yr-Aur, at rock-grid coordinates SH735026. British weather satellites have also photographed an enormous cloud, shaped like a hybrid of an upside-down question mark and cross, forming above these exact coordinates. The vault's Key, regarded as too staggering a burden for any one man to bear, was divided in two parts, with half entrusted to Eddie Van Halen and half to David Lee Roth, shortly after Roth left the rock supergroup Van Halen. The two men, who have refused to work together for 20 years, recently announced plans for a historic reunion tour. ""Before we shake Heaven and Earth with the vicious power of this riff, we of the High Council of Elders of the Guardians of the Protectorate of Rock ask you: Are you about to rock?"" AC/DC guitarist Angus Young said. ""If so, we salute you."" When asked to comment on the possible dangers of using the riff, Sir Paul McCartney seemed surprised. ""There's a secret vault to save rock and roll?"" McCartney said. ""This is the first I've heard of it.""","entertainment, music, culture, summer music, news, vol 43 issue 10, entertainment"

3157,"Oscars Reveal Widening Gap Between Best, Worst Dressed","LOS ANGELES'This year's Academy Awards pre-ceremony red carpet display has analysts worried that the divide between the nation's best and worst dressed is only growing, forcing thousands to live well below the taste line while a lucky few see their glamour levels skyrocket. 'Every year it's the same story, with the flashy getting flashier and the trashy getting trashier,' said red carpet fashion expert Melissa Rivers, who brought attention to the issue Sunday night in a special post-Oscars report broadcast on the TV Guide channel. 'If nothing is done to level the playing field, we may never see members of the fashion underprivileged, like Lindsay Lohan and Pamela Anderson, make the transition from sham to glam.' Oscar night fashion, which many experts use as a bellwether for the state of celebrity gorgeousness nationwide, has shown in recent years a high concentration of couture in the hands of a few, with Halle Berry alone commanding over 57 percent of the nation's supply of sexy yet exquisitely tasteful gowns. 'We can't just assume that because Nicole Kidman, Jennifer Aniston, and Kate Winslet look amazing, everything is okay,' said Rivers, as celebrity stylist Phillip Bloch and In Touch magazine fashion commentator Goumba Johnny nodded in solemn agreement. 'For every Sarah Jessica Parker, there's an overdressed underclass of Mary-Kate Olsens and Paula Abduls.' While fashion moguls have long predicted that investing in designer dresses would have an impact throughout Hollywood, little style has actually trickled down to those most in need. Fixtures of the fashion elite like Sandra Bullock, Jennifer Lopez, and George Clooney, and younger taste mavens Reese Witherspoon and Anne Hathaway continue to occupy the highest strata, while Helena Bonham Carter, Mariah Carey, and Diane Keaton perennially personify the depressing lack of upward mobility, Rivers said. 'The best-dressed, worst-dressed divide is also a generational problem, as the children of worst-dressed celebrities are less likely to encounter the same glamour opportunities as children of best-dressed celebs,' Rivers continued. 'Just look at the Osbourne children. It's tragic. It's tragic.' Some celebrities, such as Jennifer Love Hewitt and Heather Graham, are accused of pursuing fashion beyond their fame. Moreover, a growing number of style analysts, including Rivers' counterpart and TV personality Jay Manuel, place blame for the current state of elegance squarely on the shoulders of the devastated celebrities themselves. 'It's all about personal responsibility: pull yourself up by your own Choo straps,' Manuel said. 'Courtney Love has her choice of any Versace gown she wants, but she chooses to look like she just stumbled out the back door of a methadone clinic. You just have to want to work hard and apply yourself.' Others insist that celebrities do not choose their worst-dressed fate, but are victims of recent fashion disasters from which they have not yet recovered. 'I don't believe for a minute that any of this is [the celebrities'] fault,' said longtime red-carpet presence Joan Rivers, Melissa's mother. 'Who in the world chooses to present themselves like Sharon Stone? Who goes out and dresses like Tori Spelling on purpose? No one, that's who! Gawd! It makes me sick!' Rivers then simulated the act of forcing herself to vomit to emphasize her disgust over the accelerating fashion disparity.","entertainment, celebrities, oscars, tv, shopping, news, vol 43 issue 09, entertainment"

'As soon as she steps into the module, she is bombarded by bright lights, images, and sounds programmed to accurately recreate the Academy Awards environment,' said Oscar 9000 designer Howard Franks, adding that DeGeneres must make over 120 different jokes per simulation on such topics as ceremony length, dress choices, Oscar snubs, and Jack Nicholson's facial expressions. 'If Miss DeGeneres fails to construct an amusing yet inoffensive quip, the timing mechanism kicks in, slowing down her agonizing exposure to the silent, disappointed glare of Hollywood's most glamorous.'

3161,Dane Cook Parlays New Burger King Menu Item Into Hour-Long HBO Special,"LOS ANGELES'Building upon his previous Burger King'related work, comedian Dane Cook announced plans Monday to tape an hour-long HBO stand-up special devoted entirely to the Texas Double Whopper, the latest menu offering from the fast-food giant. ""Bro, I got a solid 15 [minutes] on the name alone,"" said Cook on the ""Danecast"" video weblog feature on his MySpace page. ""I'm still working out the kinks, but I'm probably gonna call it the 'T-Dubs' or maybe the 'Spicy Dub-Whops.'"" Cook said that the new burger, which substitutes jalapeño peppers and mustard for the original Double Whopper's mayonnaise and ketchup, has inspired him to ""new creative heights."" The routine came to the popular comic ""in a flash"" as he watched a Burger King TV spot for the sandwich during ESPN's World Series Of Poker. Last week, HBO signed Cook to produce, write, and star in the special tentatively titled Dane Cook: Burgasm for an unprecedented $25 million, the highest amount the cable network has ever paid to a comedian for a one-time-only, fast-food-themed performance. ""When Dane told us what he had in mind, we couldn't sign off on it fast enough,"" HBO's Chairman and CEO Chris Albrecht said. ""We love working with Dane. He's a truly energetic talent, and we're sure that whatever he comes up with, people will watch."" Cook said he completely scrapped all of his old fast-food material and, in his usual diligent way, spent several weeks creating hours of new Texas Double Whopper jokes, then ""painfully"" pared down the act to what he described on MySpace as ""what you might call 'completely off the fucking hook.'"" ""I'll ease the audience in by calling [the Texas Double Whopper] a 'sangwich,' and Burger King the 'BK Lounge,' but then I'll hit them with both barrels and call it the 'BK Lounge sangwich,'"" Cook said. ""You can expect me to pace some, then squat, then probably growl like I'm hungry, and say 'Huuuungry!' And to really hit it home, I'll climb up on the stool, howl, kick the stool over, and dive to the ground and do the worm. It looks totally spontaneous, but it's all carefully choreographed, and that's the beauty of it."" ""I mean, the fucking thing has jalapeños on it, bro,"" Cook added. ""Jalapeños."" Last month, Cook tested the new material in small comedy clubs across the country, trying out different inflections and pitches on newly created Cook-isms for soft-drink dispensers as well as gauging audience response to iterations of the word ""dude."" ""Stand-up comedy is an art form'it's not just writing and telling jokes,"" Cook said. ""It requires your whole body and soul to gesticulate wildly and yell the same things about sesame seeds and mustard over and over at the audience in different voices until they laugh."" ""And if there's a camera present, stand-up is an art form that's about putting your face as close as possible to that camera and screaming at it,"" Cook continued. The taping is scheduled to take place in mid-April at Madison Square Garden. Plans are underway to erect a state-of-the-art hamburger-shaped set, and install nearly two dozen wide-screen TV monitors that will capture every subtle change in Cook's facial expressions as he performs for eager fans. ""I'm gonna need all that shit when I launch into my 20-minute bit about ketchup packets,"" Cook said. ""That's when I really start running around. And screaming, bro."" While Cook revealed that he will wear a new white T-shirt, leather wristband, and a pair of specially designed jeans, and has promised to pepper his performance with several crowd-pleasing callbacks to the most ""pivotal"" cheese and pickle jokes, he declined to disclose any further details. ""I want all my fans to be surprised, but I will say that a significant portion of [the special] will focus on the time when the dude I ordered from at the BK Lounge looked at me all like, 'Pfffffffft,'"" said Cook, contorting his face into a cross-eyed, puckered grimace. ""Swear to fucking God, bro, 'Pfffffffft!' Just like that!"" ""Bro, 'Pfffffffft!'"" Cook said. Cook refused to comment on rumors that he has modified his ""Superfinger""'an obscene gesture he invented in which both the middle and ring fingers are extended'to incorporate several additional fingers that mimic the action of holding a burger while simultaneously stimulating a woman's clitoris.","entertainment, celebrities, television, fast food, news, vol 43 issue 08, entertainment"
3162,Justin Timberlake Apathetically Crowned King Of Pop,"LOS ANGELES'Performer Justin Timberlake, whose hit albums include Justified and FutureSex/LoveSounds, was crowned the de facto 'King of Pop' Monday by recording-industry executives and millions of fans unable to think of anyone else to bestow the title upon. 'It might as well be him,' said occasional music consumer Sophie Grant, 23, of Lincoln, NE, who claimed to have purchased one of Timberlake's CDs within the last few years. 'We haven't had a King of Pop since Michael Jackson went off the rails, so I suppose they had to pick somebody.' 'He's huge, right?' she added. A former member of the 1990s boy band 'N Sync, a musical act known primarily for its popularity, Timberlake has dominated the pop charts as a solo artist in recent years due to a trait music-industry insiders call 'the magic 'whatever' factor''the elusive star quality whereby the majority of listeners do not actively find a recording artist to be objectionable. With responses ranging from tepid acceptance to noncommittal approval, Timberlake has ridden a massive wave of public indifference to become the pop world's biggest superstar-by-default. 'Numbers don't lie: Justin is really popular,' Jive Records marketing director Gail Meyers said. 'We even checked the sales-tracking SoundScan thing, just to be sure, and it turns out, yeah, he's sold a lot of units.' 'And his music is definitely 'pop,' no question there,' Meyers continued. 'So there's that.' It is widely assumed that the new title was cemented during Sunday's Grammys ceremony, when Timberlake gave a performance half-watched by more than 300 million viewers worldwide. 'Justin Timberlake is the undisputed King of Pop, I guess,' Des Moines, IA administrative assistant Duane Carlisle, 26, said. 'He also dated that famous actress and was in that big movie that my cousin saw.' 'You could say he deserves it, after all those hits I know he's had,' 38-year-old Chicago-area freight driver Bob Shipps said. 'I've seen him on billboards and on TV. He dances. He's certainly an international sensation or what have you.' Nineteen-year-old University of Minnesota student Kristin Roper, who said she 'had a nice time' at a recent Timberlake concert, owns both of the new pop king's albums. 'One I got myself, and then my girlfriend bought the other one for me for my birthday, which was nice of her to do,' Roper said. 'I get a lot of his songs stuck in my head, but I don't think I could pick a favorite.' Music industry observers said Timberlake was virtually the only candidate for the title since wildly popular singers such as Jessica Simpson and Shakira cannot technically be called 'king.' 'He did bring sexy back,' Rolling Stone Executive Editor Joe Levy said. 'I can't even think of anyone else who would qualify. Oh, yeah, I forgot about Usher. He could have been King of Pop. Oh well, too late now.' To celebrate the news, Timberlake will reportedly throw a party sometime this weekend at a chic New York or Miami nightclub with dozens of fellow celebrities, which will be photographed and reported on by a wide array of celebrity-focused magazines and websites.","entertainment, celebrities, media, culture, michael jackson, news, vol 43 issue 07, justin timberlake, entertainment"

""Readers will be fascinated by Forsythe's agonizing realization that his love of food was really just a substitute for loving himself, something he deems impossible due to his guilt over the premature death of his baby sister, Forsythia, and the predatory sexual overtures he suffers at the hands of Mr. Flutesnoot,"" author and cartoonist Adrian Tomine said. ""The poignancy is further emphasized by the glimpses of Forsythe's future, as a divorced, self-doubting, alcoholic psychiatrist with an uncontrollable weight problem.""

3176,Somebody Should Make A Movie About My Life,"I was thinking the other day, and I know it probably sounds, you know, just crazy, but I thought, you know, as irrational and dysfunctional as I am, I'll bet that, if the right filmmaker got involved, maybe somebody could make a movie dramatizing various aspects of my life. Now, just hear me out, I think I'm onto something here. There's a lot about me that audiences would find very amusing. I'm, I think, an intelligent, only-somewhat self-hating Jew who's obsessed with sex, whose various neuroses and insecurities could lead to any number of mixups and character complications. There have been some pretty funny things that have happened in my life. You could even fictionalize some of it if you wanted to. That might work. Either way, I think there's a lot of good material. I'm talking kind of an overall ""triumphs and tribulations of the daily lives of various New York intellectuals as they go about their daily lives"" kind of a thing. I've thought of a title, and if I may, it's a little self-indulgent, I know, but don't use it if you don't like it. It's Woody: Allen. Think of it as Citizen Kane meets a corned-beef sandwich. I live in New York City, so any film about my life could feature beautiful shots of the Manhattan skyline, Central Park, the Upper West Side. I know some great locations and would be happy to jot them down if you're interested. The movie could open in a sheer white room, and let's say God and I are jousting, verbally. God asks me, ""Do you think you should be admitted into Heaven, or Hell?"" And I tell him, ""I'll go wherever you want as long as I can use the car-pool lane."" This scene, as well as many others I could probably think of, conveys very well, I think, my preoccupation with death, and shows that, in a way, that our time on Earth is totally meaningless, which is one of the central themes of all the great dramatic stories. Then you could cut to an older me, played by myself, having a dispute with the younger me, played by myself, about whether or not I should engage in sexual intercourse with a beautiful young philosophy grad student. Eventually, I decide to sleep with her because she reminds me, in the heat of the moment, that if I don't ""get on with it already"" I'll be late for a dental appointment. It might be interesting to show audiences where my insecurities and neuroses come from. A scene depicting me as a young boy being harangued by my Jewish parents around the dinner table could be played for great comic effect. Or, you could flashback to my bar mitzvah. I'm chanting my Haftorah portion, really belting it out, you know, and suddenly my father walks out because I fail to sustain the high note longer than Saul Rifkin's son. I look over to the rabbi for comfort, but he's been replaced by Marshall McLuhan, who, speaking directly to the camera, tells everyone that my bar mitzvah isn't a very hot medium, and that in gym class last week I had been unable do a single pull-up. Possibly a good framing device for this picture, and I'm just throwing this out there, could be my various meetings with my analyst. This would allow me to really illustrate to audiences that I have, you know, inner doubts and problems with human contact. So, I meet my analyst, Feldman'a strict Freudian'at a hole-in-the-wall delicatessen on the Upper West Side that only three people know about: me, Feldman, and a sexy college co-ed, who is only made sexier by her hankering for exotic herring. These are just a few ideas. There are all sorts of themes from my life that could be utilized as cinematic material. The whole artist whose early, more slapstick efforts brought him great success, but whose desire to be taken more seriously leads him to emulate Bergman and Fellini to the dismay of his former fans, setting off a series of comic, yet deeply poignant insecurities about the meaning of life as an artist. That's a rich thematic vein, if I do say so myself. You could structure the film around that sort of inner dilemma. Or just the whole ""What is the role of the artist in an age when mediocrity is rewarded by the mainstream"" question. Actually, there's probably enough material to make more than one movie about my life, but, my God, look at me. Let's not get all, you know, optimistic. Either way, there could be a film in this. A funny one. It's a mixture of character humor and some solid Borscht Belt-style gags. It might not break any box-office records with today's audiences, who are all absolute philistines, but I have a feeling it would do respectable business in Manhattan, and some quarters in Europe. Oh, and I would be willing to appear in such a movie, you know, if you needed an actor.","opinion, entertainment, celebrities, human interest, movies, commentary, vol 43 issue 03, woody allen, entertainment"

""But I never could have done it without the millions and millions of young people who either have no idea I exist or are only vaguely aware of my last name.""

3185,"Kevin Federline, Wife Divorce","Celebrities and personal drama took center stage before a gossip-hungry public this year, and perhaps none received more press than superstar rapper Kevin Federline. So when his wife of two years abruptly filed for divorce, the country took notice. According to Federline's publicist, Marilyn Chang, the spouse, a 24-year-old entertainer who worked as a singer and foreground dancer at Federline performances before wedding him in 2004, presented Federline with divorce papers on Nov. 7 citing irreconcilable differences. ""K-Fed gave it his best, but in the end it just wasn't meant to be,"" said Chang of the reportedly tumultuous relationship between Federline and his partner, whose vocal talents have been featured on several pop and dance albums. ""The good news is that this separation might afford Kevin the opportunity to finally move on and grow as an artist. This marriage was really slowing him down, and I think many will agree with me when I say we want the old Kevin back."" Federline is seeking sole custody of his two sons, claiming his estranged wife, a struggling actress who has appeared in soft-drink commercials, is unfit to care for 1-year-old Sean Preston and 3-month-old Jayden James. ""Kevin is a family man,"" Chang said. ""He will do whatever is necessary to protect his kids, and he will not be undermined by this irresponsible hanger-on, who was only in the marriage to springboard her own career."" Federline has two children from a previous relationship with Shar Jackson, costar of the mid-90s UPN sitcom Moesha and a featured player in the 1997 Nickelodeon feature Good Burger.","entertainment, celebrities, family, relationships, news, vol 42 issue 51, entertainment"
3186,Al Gore Caught Warming Globe To Increase Box Office Profits,"Dozens of eyewitness reports indicated that former vice president Al Gore deliberately attempted to raise the earth's temperature in order to boost box office receipts for An Inconvenient Truth, his documentary film about global warming that was released in May. ""We have accounts from concerned citizens that Mr. Gore purchased a Cadillac Escalade SUV several months before [his film] opened in theaters,"" said Kimberly Blume, spokeswoman for the California-based environmental group Friends Of The Earth. ""Not only did Mr. Gore use his new gas-guzzler to make short trips to the grocery store, he also left the vehicle running 24 hours a day in the driveway of his Tennessee home with the air-conditioning on full-blast."" In the weeks following the film's release, witnesses reported additional sightings of Gore engaging in activities such as discharging can after can of 1980s-era, CFC-laden aerosol into the air, and single-handedly clear-cutting over 6,000 acres of Amazon rain forest. Gore is also rumored to have set a four-acre tire fire outside Akron, OH, and ordered his Secret Service detail to shoot on sight anyone who attempts to put it out. ""It's sad to see a man we thought was a passionate defender of the environment despoiling it for his own monetary gain,"" Blume said. Blume said that she and many environmentalists had momentarily expressed relief in late November when Gore appeared to cease his months-long practice of dismantling old refrigerators in order to release ozone-destroying freon into the atmosphere. Blume soon learned, however, that Gore had resumed the activity in Antarctica, where the earth's ozone layer is most fragile. Environmental groups have called for the federal government to step in and put a stop to Gore's actions, but officials say they do not have the power to stop him. ""There is no legal recourse anyone can take against the former vice president,"" Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Stephen L. Johnson said. ""Mr. Gore is well within the emissions standards set by the current administration."" By year's end, Gore failed to slow his assault on the planet's delicately balanced climate systems. Satellite surveillance revealed what many believe to be a snowshoed Gore jumping up and down on an ice shelf in Greenland, chainsawing glaciers in the Alaskan wild, and urinating in the Gulf Stream waters off the coast of Newfoundland.","entertainment, politicians, environment, weather, news, vol 42 issue 51, entertainment"

""Praise be to Allah, who permitted the wronged to retaliate against the oppressor in kind!"" While Irwin's family has not commented on the statement, Australian Prime Minister John Howard denounced the act shortly after Irwin's funeral.

3191,"Ho, Ho, Ho! I Saw You Masturbating!","Season's greetings from your old friend Santa! My, oh, my, only 12 nights left until Christmas Eve! Things are getting so close now, we can hardly contain ourselves here at the North Pole. And from the looks of it, my young friend, we're not the only ones set to burst! Why, Jolly Old Saint Nick hasn't seen a Yule log this lit in ages! Now, don't be shy. You know what Santa's talking about. You just couldn't wait to open your present this year, could you? Ho, ho, ho! Dear child, I saw you masturbating! And it hasn't been just once either! Oh, no! Santa's seen you at least twice splashing away in the bathtub, three times in the attic with one of your mother's old art-history books, and more times than even he can count spread out like a stunned partridge on that beanbag chair of yours! Why, old Santa might just have a heart attack if he popped out your chimney on that cold winter's night and, instead of milk and cookies, found his dear little pen pal shamefully hunched over the family computer. Oh, what a naughty, prolific rascal you've been! You see, dear lad, Santa's been keeping a list. Just like the one you keep in your head of all your favorite classmates. The one you've checked so much more than twice. Except when Santa thinks about his list, he doesn't rub his crotch feverishly against the smooth contours of his writing desk. Ho, ho, ho! I see you when you're sleeping, child, and I know when you're awake. And, believe it or not, I even know when you're just pretending to sleep, but really have your rosy palms down the front of your britches. Yes, I suppose you could say old Kris Kringle knows everything there is to know. Well, not everything. You did teach me a thing or two about scented body wash! Ho, ho, ho! Tell me now, what do you want Santa to bring you this year? A bright red bicycle? Some fun new board games? Or should I just have the elves wrap up a fresh batch of those satin pillows you enjoy straddling so much? Or maybe St. Nick shouldn't bring you anything at all this Christmas. After all, Mrs. Claus knitted you a special pair of socks last year, and just look what became of those! Oh, what ever happened to that sweet, freckle-faced angel we all loved so much? Such a bright little youngster, so good to your mommy and daddy, and quick to make friends. Now all you seem to want to do is play by yourself for hours on end. It makes everyone here at my workshop very, very sad. Why the reindeer haven't been able to keep down their feed since hearing about how you slap yourself around. And Mrs. Claus, do you know what she did when she found out? She cried. She cried for the first time in almost 700 years. Where before we enjoyed visions of gumdrops and candy canes, now we see you, once so dear to us all, kneeling against a plastic chair, spitting on two fingers, and putting them lordy knows where. I must say, the sights you conjure up while you lie in your bed have even Santa Claus scratching his head. I doubt any of the high-school cheerleaders have ever even set foot inside a boiler room before, never mind done anything like that! And other things'other terrible, frightful things. If your outlandish fantasies didn't make me quake with disgust, I'd say you were the most creative child in the world. Is it Clara? Is that who you think about when you rub yourself raw? Ho, ho, ho! Why she doesn't even know your name, dear child! You didn't really think you had a chance with her, did you? A pretty girl like that? But your face'it's covered in pockmarks, for goodness sake! Don't cry now, little one. I'm sure some of the Barbie dolls you steal from your sister's room find you very attractive. I bet they hardly even notice your embarrassing stutter, or that pungent and sickly body odor of yours. Or even how pathetic you really are, my child. What a sad, lonely, feeble little shit you are, and how your life'your wretched little life'will be filled with failure after failure, both personal and professional, until the stench of disappointment and heartbreak grows so strong that you'll barely be able to breathe. Well, it looks old Santa has to get back to work!

3199,'C-List Celebrity Killer' Leaves Police Enthusiastically Guessing Who's Next,"LOS ANGELES'Following Thursday's gruesome discovery of the remains of former Blossom star Joey Lawrence, law enforcement officials are feverishly speculating on the identity of the next victim of the so-called ""C-list Celebrity Killer."" ""We have reason to believe that Dan Cortese, Melissa Rivers, both Kid and Play, or British model Jordan could be next,"" said Lt. Greg Javers of the Los Angeles Police Department at a press conference Monday. ""Oh, and that 'I see dead people' kid,"" said Javers' associate, Lt. Jerry Patelli. ""You know, what's-his-name."" The ""C-list Celebrity Killer"" is believed to have claimed as his first victim, Sabrina The Teenage Witch's Melissa Joan Hart, whose body was discovered floating near the Long Beach docks eight months ago, although some following the case believe that Jackie ""The Jokeman"" Martling's apparent suicide in April 2005 was the killer's handiwork as well. ""As a profiler, I really try to get inside the killer's head, see the world as he would see it,"" Javers said. ""Who's out of the public eye and for how long? Have they done any long-distance phone commercials? Are they trying to lose weight on reality TV programs?"" ""I'd also keep a very close eye on Yasmine Bleeth, the brunette from Baywatch who's not Carmen Electra,"" he added. The ensuing deaths of ex-Married With Children actor David Faustino, the girl in that Lolita remake a few years back, and Lou Diamond Phillips, have police combing the website imdb.com and frantically attempting to recall the names of stars of such defunct TV shows as The Nanny and Melrose Place. ""For a while, we thought about contacting Jenny McCarthy to make sure she was taking the necessary precautions, but then we saw that movie she wrote, directed, and starred in on Showtime,"" Patelli said. ""Tough to say if she's at risk or not. For now, we'll just stick close to the police scanner and see how this one plays out."" Investigators said the most common patterns among the slain celebrities include routinely starring in shows cancelled within two seasons and appearing in made-for-TV or direct-to-DVD movies. ""We believe the likeliest targets are R&B one-hit wonders from the late '80s and early '90s, former child stars, and Maxim cover girls,"" Javers said. ""You remember Punky Brewster? She had this weird name: Soleil something something, I think. Anyway, she's probably on the killer's list, too."" A subsequent discussion between the two policemen eventually ruled out Jamie Kennedy and David Arquette as potential victims. Skeet Ulrich was also crossed off the list when Capt. Janice White reminded them that he was starring in a new, mildly popular TV series. After combing the Dawson's Creek complete series DVD set last month, Javers devised an elaborate ""dead pool"" the two officers planned to use to predict the next victim. ""Just when we thought we'd cracked the code, Molly Ringwald turned up bound and strangled in a Beverly Hills motel room,"" Patelli said. ""We certainly didn't see that coming. My wife swears she just saw her on Scrubs or one of the doctor shows."" ""It's like he's toying with us,"" he added. The FBI has embarked on a related effort dubbed Operation Where Are They Now, in which they are canvassing houseboats and nightclubs and bars where celebrities have made paid personal appearances over the past three years, and scouring the call-back lists of auditions for Law & Order: Criminal Intent. Police said that while they are following every lead, many of which are ""going nowhere fast,"" they are overwhelmed by the sheer number of potential victims. ""After all these years on the force, I'll never figure out why bad things happen to good people,"" Javers said. ""Rob Morrow was terrific in Northern Exposure, and really showed his range in Quiz Show. To see him gutted and defiled like that'it's enough to make you wish Orlando Bloom wasn't on such a hot streak, you know?"" There have been setbacks in the case, as well. In July, a lengthy discussion about whether Eric Roberts qualified as a C-list celebrity was disrupted by a phone call reporting that he had been found slain. ""After that, we really wanted to shift our attention to Peter Scolari, the guy from that Tom Hanks show,"" Patelli said. ""But, in the end, we figured the C-list killer wouldn't waste his time on him, so why should we?""","entertainment, crime, news, vol 42 issue 46, entertainment"

""The prosecutor was just so intense and animated, and when he demanded that the jury show the accused killer no more mercy than he showed those young girls, I swear, he was looking right at me,"" said Daniels, who added that the defense attorney's disarming cross-examination of an important but unstable witness was just the kind of ""riveting performance"" she was hoping for. ""Every day I know by the way the defendant glances at me that he is wondering if I, specifically, am on his side. And I love that."" Heading in to deliberations, Daniels said she was not certain that Mitchell deserved the most severe punishment in the land, but admitted that a capital sentence had the most potential for multiple juicy appeals.","entertainment, human interest, death, crime, courts, news in brief, vol 42 issue 43, entertainment"

3206,Martin Scorsese's Next Film To Be Three Hours Of Begging For Oscar,"NEW YORK'Director Martin Scorsese, long praised as one of the greatest modern American filmmakers for his works Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, The Last Temptation Of Christ, and Goodfellas, is following up his recent string of critically acclaimed triumphs with The Entitled, a three-hour, unabashed plea for a Best Director Oscar that opens nationwide Friday. Scorsese has lost to almost every major American filmmaker in his career, including actor'director Kevin Costner, who went on to create Waterworld and The Postman. ""I've been making pictures for 40 years,"" said the intense, fast-talking Scorsese in an excerpt from The Entitled, during which the Rolling Stones' ""Gimme Shelter"" can be heard in the background. ""For 40 years, I've been making pictures. And I've always been fascinated with the struggles a man must endure when people don't appreciate him. People say I'm the best. I didn't say it, they did. I just do my work. But for years they've been talking and you know it. You do. I deserve that award, is all I'm saying."" The film, produced, directed, and independently released by the five-time Academy Award nominee, is a bold departure from his signature style of rapid editing, kinetic camera movement, and intricately choreographed tracking shots, instead employing only a single camera on a stationary tripod, with virtually no editing besides brief opening and closing credits. Captivating narratives of moral decay and violent machismo were notably absent, as Scorsese focused on a a simple message of redemption and gratification he hoped would be ""real easy for everyone to understand."" ""For years I did the little pictures about the types of people I grew up with,"" said a passionately gesturing Scorsese in another Entitled scene. ""Then I did the prestige-y, historical stuff like Last Temptation and The Age Of Innocence because I related to the characters, you know, outsiders in repressive environments making fateful choices. Then I started making the big sweeping epics, like Kundun and The Aviator. I've made comedies and documentaries, even concert films. Ever heard of The Last Waltz? No? Okay. You should."" Continued Scorsese, ""What happens? Nothing. Nothing for the versatile visionary who lives and breathes pictures."" Scorsese goes on to describe in meticulous detail individual scenes ""that alone should have won the Oscar,"" including Travis Bickle posing with his guns in front of a mirror in Taxi Driver, the close-up of coffee cups at the Debonair Social Club in Raging Bull, and the pool-hall fight scene in Mean Streets. ""Remember my scene in the back of the cab in Taxi Driver?"" Scorsese said. ""That was me. I was that guy. That was me. Everyone remembers that."" ""You already should have done right by me with Gangs Of New York,"" he said. ""I handed you guys that one on a silver platter."" Although Scorsese does away with his traditional ensemble cast in The Entitled, several of his past associates make brief appearances, including director and screenwriter Paul Schrader, friend and collaborator Jay Cocks, and film editor Thelma Schoonmaker. ""There's Paul,"" said Scorsese as Schrader briefly tilted his head into the frame and waved. ""He has his own directorial career and he still says I should get an Oscar. He should, too. None of us are above wanting a little recognition. We're not stuck up."" ""You want feel-good and heartwarming, right?"" Scorsese said. ""I can do that. Or I can do casual violence with no strings attached. You know I can. What else you want? Kung-fu wire-work? Mentally disabled guy? Boring Robert Redford-style fishing movie? Just tell me what to do, I'll do it. Done. End of story. Give me my Oscar and I'm out of here. Poof."" Newsweek movie critic David Ansen called The Entitled Scorsese's ""best shot"" at a directing Oscar since his most recent loss to Clint Eastwood for Million Dollar Baby. ""Filming in a soundstage in Burbank instead of on the streets of New York was a risk, but it will pay off,"" Ansen said. ""As long as Spielberg doesn't come out with anything, I'd say this is Scorsese's year."" Film-industry insiders said that The Entitled was already being talked about as the frontrunner for the Golden Globes, the Palme d'Or, Cannes, and Tribeca Film Festival honors, and an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay.","entertainment, movies, news, vol 42 issue 43, entertainment"

3208,Studio 60 Was Better When It First Came Out,"I remember when the famous phrase ""Live from Studio 60, it's Friday Night In Hollywood!"" used to mean something. Back then, when the show first came out, I'd stay home every Monday night just to make sure I didn't miss an episode. There was such a buzz around the show in the weeks leading up to its premiere because it was something new, something no one had ever seen before. But ever since Judd Hirsch left, the show's totally gone downhill. Even by just watching the show in those early days, you felt like you were part of something special. It was truly the first of its kind'so revolutionary that it immediately spawned imitators like 30 Rock. I don't know whether it was better writing, hip musical guests like Three 6 Mafia, or the whole novelty of being the first-ever show about a late-night sketch-comedy show, but regardless of whatever made it so great in those days, it has certainly not aged well. I don't even understand why anyone watches it anymore. In Studio 60's heyday, they would do this thing where Judd would come out before the opening credits and deliver this long, angry monologue about the current state of network television. I used to sit in front of the TV, just waiting for him to unleash his famous catchphrase, ""It's not going to be a very good show tonight."" But they haven't done that for a while. I wish they would just get rid of this current cast and start from scratch. Back when the show first hit the airwaves, they were constantly coming up with new, interesting characters, like Amanda Peet's manipulative but well-intentioned NBS president ""Jordan McDeere,"" or Matthew Perry's hilarious stressed-out-writer character ""Matt Albie."" I'd say they introduced eight to 10 great characters in the first episode alone, but then they kept using those same exact characters in every single show. Sure, they put them in slightly different situations and gave them new dialogue, but they got really old really fast. How many times do I have to see a ""Matt and Danny"" scene or a ""Jordan and Jack"" scene? Three or four times per show? It's just lazy. They've fallen into the trap of using the same tired old formula week in and week out, just because they know it works. Every episode, it's a cold open that sets up a conflict, followed by the opening credits, followed by acts one through six, almost always ending with a neat little resolution and a new cliffhanger. And they keep drawing on the same overused topics'TV networks, network sponsors, sketch comedyEE Talk about milking a premise for all it's worth. Okay, we get it already. I understand this is the format that made the show popular, but you can't rely on it forever. Maybe it was just a matter of the show being in the right place at the right time. The nation was still reeling from the fifth anniversary of 9/11, the Pope had just made those insensitive comments about the Muslim religion, and we were all on edge about the E. coli spinach scare.

3215,Retired S1Ws Recalled To Active Duty,"STRONG ISLAND, NY'With recruitment down sharply, and the prospect of being held back by the nation of millions appearing once again likely, top-ranking Public Enemy officials issued an order Monday for all retired Security Of The First World personnel to return to active duty. ""In order to come to the aid of the hip-hop nation, we must regrettably ask those men who heroically served the Black Planet to once again don their fatigues and take up their plastic arms,"" S1W Chief and Public Enemy Minister Of Information Professor Griff said. ""We have no more options. It's not as though we can simply call 911. That would be a joke."" ""Some see this as a sign of defeat,"" Griff added. ""Don't believe the hype: We will come out triumphant in this Mess Age."" S1W comprised the paramilitary security wing of the Public Enemy forces from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s. Their intimidating martial presence and synchronized dance steps routinely struck fear in the hearts of concertgoers hoping to enjoy a Beastie Boys or Big Audio Dynamite performance. Although successfully deployed during the ongoing power-fighting that marked much of Public Enemy's existence, doubts have been raised, even among S1Ws themselves, of their current effectiveness. ""I am proud of my service to Public Enemy,"" said retired S1W Roger Chillous, 41. ""I was right there in the front of the stage for the First London Invasion tour of duty right before I retired. But I can no longer effortlessly execute the complex choreographed maneuvers that were once required of me. I wasn't called up for the East Coast'West Coast conflict, so I don't understand why I was for this."" Others adopted a militant stance evocative of their younger days, claiming that they have already done their fair share of cold lampin'. ""I got a letter from the P.E. the other day,"" said James Bomb, 46, also a former S1W. ""I opened it, and read it, and said they were suckers. They want me for their army or whatever? Picture me giving a damn'I said 'Never.'"" ""Then again, I could use the money,"" Bomb added. John ""Pop"" Oliver, 52, said that commitments to his wife and children make returning to the S1W life much more difficult. ""How is my family going to feel when they turn on the news to find out that the Bomb Squad has been sent into action again?"" Oliver said. ""I'm like, comatose walking around. I just got my life back, I'm not ready to leave it behind."" Public Enemy leader Chuck D admitted that he had ""greatly underestimated"" the strength of the power in the late 1990s, having called it ""contained"" and discharging all but a small force of S1Ws. Despite numerous campaigns to create a broad, multi-racial coalition in order to increase recruitment, such as joint actions with Anthrax, U2 and Gang of Four, recruitment has been less than half that of pre-1992 levels. In addition, there has been some question about the conditions to which the S1Ws will return. The Jeep Beat Troops were decimated in the Revolverlution of 2002, and the S1Ws' once-proud fleet of 98 Oldsmobiles have fallen into disrepair, lacking the armor plating that would keep them safe under fire. Though the initial recall order was for just six S1Ws, speculation ran rampant that this was just the first of many such recalls. One high-ranking member spoke on the condition of anonymity. ""No one is happy to execute this order,"" the source said. ""Unfortunately, so long as the show is under siege by a constant stream of potential bum-rushers, there seems to be no end in sight for this conflict. We may have too much posse, but we still require the critical support of the S1Ws. Yeeeeaaaaaah, boyyyyyyy!""

3221,Uninvited Guest Rapper Ruins Album,"BRONX, NY'Despite already having lent his vocals to six of the 10 tracks on Fat Joe's latest album and drinking every can of Red Bull in the recording room's mini-fridge, uninvited guest rapper Lil Wayne continued to miss repeated hints that he should ""hit the fucking curb,"" the Atlantic recording artist and 36-year-old Bronx native said Tuesday. According to Fat Joe, Lil Wayne, who appeared at the studio ""just to holla"" after ""passing through the [neighbor]hood"" last Thursday, was allowed to stay for the recording of a few verses on his fellow rapper's newest effort, Me Myself & I. Five days and dozens of studio hours later, however, Fat Joe said he had made a ""serious mistake"" by granting the 23-year-old, New Orleans-born rapper such wide latitude. ""That nigga's in everybody's way,"" Fat Joe said. ""It'd be one thing if homeboy helped to clean up a studio track every now and then, or offered to replace some of the beats he's used without asking. But all he does is make more work for me."" ""Don't he have his own goddamn rap album with his own guests to go work on?"" Fat Joe added. Although Fat Joe said he had gotten along with Lil Wayne in the past, ""every motherfucking little thing,"" from the way the unwanted MC incorrectly emphasizes the first syllable of the word ""bizzatch,"" to the way he constantly ""flashes his ice,"" has begun to irritate him. ""I've tried to meet the sucka halfway and just have him come in on the chorus of most songs,"" Fat Joe said. ""But you know what the sad nigga do? He repeats the last word of every verse, right after I spit it. Did he always do that shit, and I just never noticed?"" Fat Joe said that the only contribution his unsolicited collaborator has so far made to the album was inspiring the song ""Blood-Sucking Moochaz Who Stick Around For A Damn Week Almost."" ""I thought that maybe after listening to that rhyme, he would've realized he'd overstayed his welcome,"" Fat Joe said. ""But nigga just bitched that the bass was too low."" According to Fat Joe, the mood, already strained after a 40-oz. bottle of malt liquor was spilled on expensive sound equipment Friday, worsened Sunday when he was forced to eject nearly a dozen of Lil Wayne's friends from the studio. ""It was a fucking block party up in here, and now every one of them freeloading bitches got to get shout-outs in the liner notes,"" said Fat Joe, who claimed to receive icy glares from the expelled revelers, ""as if [he] was the hater in all this."" ""If Lil Wayne was dropping Franklins to cover studio time, I wouldn't mind him having people over. But he ain't,"" he added. ""I can't even tell if this is a Fat Joe album anymore,"" Fat Joe said. ""And now I got to pay royalties to this nigga, too?"" Me Myself & I was scheduled to be released later this fall, but the unexpected spike in salaries and production cost overruns has prompted Atlantic to table the project until legal arrangements are first worked out. The development has reportedly dismayed executives from the label. ""In the industry, it's common knowledge that if you're going to invite a guest rapper, you make sure you're both on the same wavelength,"" said an Atlantic artists and repertoire executive who requested anonymity. ""If you're Too $hort, you have to be down with T-Pain. If you're Trick Daddy, you're cool with Twista. And so on."" Despite their friction, Fat Joe attributes his reluctance to kick out Lil Wayne to their long history together. ""Lil Wayne is like a brother to me'I'd take a bullet for that nigga,"" Fat Joe said. ""But, damn, I ain't never had this trouble from R. Kelly or the Terror Squad. I got a beef with 50 [Cent], but hell, at least I don't got to see him that much."" ""Nigga, please,"" Fat Joe added. ""Leave."" Me Myself & I, featuring Lil Wayne, Petey Pablo, Juvenile, Turk, Noreaga, Pastor Troy, Paul Wall, Onyx, Three 6 Mafia, Skull Duggery, Canibus, Capone, and four or five of Lil Wayne's other friends that Fat Joe had never even seen before in his life, could be released as early as January ""if busta ever gets his skinny ass the hell on.""","entertainment, coworkers, summer music, news, vol 42 issue 38, entertainment"
3222,Author Too Much Of A Pussy To Kill Off Characters,"MINNEAPOLIS, MN'In what many in the literary world are decrying as a violation of the sacred bond between author and readers, Benjamin Webb's much-anticipated second novel, In Winter's Shadow, a follow-up to his acclaimed debut Autumn's End, has met with abject disdain from critics and readers feeling exhausted and betrayed by Webb's tendency to ""puss out"" when it comes to ending the lives of any of his characters. Webb, 26, was praised as a ""literary wunderkind"" by Newsweek in 2003 after his ambitious first novel, a 452-page account of five generations of a Norwegian'American farm family living in Minnesota. Yet it slowly dawned on readers of his even more ambitious 579-page sequel that the penetratingly insightful young writer had no intention of addressing the mortality of his characters. ""You know the grandfather character who was something like 84 in 1973?"" said Chicago resident Kaya Bishop, who was referring to family patriarch Per Kjellstad. ""The book goes to the modern day, and he's still alive."" ""Why is he still alive?"" she added. Also returning was Kjellstad's son, alcoholic Korean War veteran Christian, now nearly 77 in the tale, who was trapped in a flaming barn at the close of In Winter's Shadow, and rebellious gay grandson Derek, who contracted AIDS in 1981. Even the Mexican émigré handyman Jesus Diaz, whom Bishop, along with many astute readers, had assumed to be a secondary character meant to die in the book's violent burglary scene, makes an appearance in the final chapter. Ten new characters are also introduced, and all remain alive and healthy'including two who were newly pregnant'at the book's end. ""Take that whole Felice thing,"" said Bishop of the over-curious teenaged great-great-granddaughter of Kjellstad. ""She has all the makings of an innocent victim of her family's messy history. It'd be a tragic and largely unjust death, but at least it might help us relate to the inherent randomness and vulnerability of the human condition. Instead, Felice receives answers to all her questions and eventually opens a craft shop in town."" ""We all know you're in love with this fictional character, Mr. Webb, but please, do us all a favor and kill her already,"" Bishop added. In fact, a stillborn infant, Kjellstad's late first wife Kirsten, and the suicidal farmer whose land Kjellstad purchased in a foreclosure auction in 1932 were the only non-living human beings mentioned in In Winter's Shadow. But Kirsten's death came before 1924, the year the narrative begins, the farmer was never alluded to when alive, and the infant was later revived. Also perplexing to readers were the slaps on the wrist dispensed to those in clear need of poetic justice. Peter Reid, a former St. Olaf College classmate of Webb's, told reporters that his tutu-wearing 6-year-old niece could write more compelling fiction. ""You want me to believe that a pill-popping, fanatically religious feed-store dealer who raped his niece shouldn't have ended up getting shot in revenge by the emotionally troubled Kjellstad boy?"" said Reid, who read a galley copy of the book prior to its release. ""I asked [Webb] about it, and he went on about how I'd missed the feed-store guy's loving and compassionate side."" ""Christ, Webb, grow a pair,"" he added. Reached for comment in his Grand Marais-area cabin in which he does most of his writing, the unchallenged master of the literary cop-out genre defended his authorial choices. ""I don't know about you, but I can't wait to see what happens to [fly-fisher and limerick-loving town eccentric] Patrick Munson in the third book,"" Webb said. ""I know the readers are clamoring for his death. But it would be like saying goodbye to a close friend taken way before his time. I'm sure people will agree when they read Before The Thaw."" With the exception of The New York Times' Janet Maslin, who gave In Winter's Shadow a favorable review, critics once sympathetic to Webb's work are universally panning the book. Publisher's Weekly denounced it as ""life-affirming schlock,"" while Harper's deemed it ""the most frustratingly victimless book since Ethan Frome."" Oprah Winfrey, who was considering featuring the novel in her high-profile Oprah's Book Club, decided to drop it after determining that her viewers would ""probably not get anything out of a death-free story."" Despite poor reviews and meager sales, Webb said he was excited to begin his next project: a work of historical fiction that will provide ""a whole new take"" on the Kennedy clan.","entertainment, death, books, news, vol 42 issue 38, entertainment"

3227,,"PHOENIX'9-year-old leukemia patient Tyler Blashock was initially ecstatic to learn Monday that the Make-A-Wish Foundation was sending Macho Man Randy Savage to meet him at the Phoenix Children's Hospital. But after spending half a day with Savage, Blashock said he wished the 44-year-old wrestler would ""just go."" Tyler, who was diagnosed six months ago with acute lymphocytic leukemia and has undergone chemotherapy through painful cerebrospinal injection, said the two-time WWF World Heavyweight Champion was physically and mentally demanding. ""I really only wanted him to give me an autograph and tell me what it was like to fight the Ultimate Warrior,"" Tyler said. ""Not read me bedtime stories and try to feed me."" ""Crying hurts,"" Tyler added. Tyler's father Frank said he and wife Helen were ""thrilled"" that their son would finally have a positive experience, ""especially after his hair started falling out."" ""But in Tyler's weakened state, it's all been too much,"" Frank said. ""Far too intense."" According to Helen Blashock, Macho Man, who arrived wearing dark sunglasses and matching leather hat and vest, burst into Tyler's hospital room and shouted, ""Hey there little dude, I'm here to make you feel gooooood!"" ""You could just see the confusion in Tyler's eyes'he didn't understand why this was happening to him,"" Mrs. Blashock said. ""He's been so brave."" Savage, who told Tyler his sickness reminded him of the time he wrestled Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat and ""crushed that pip-squeak's larynx,"" said that he enjoys helping less-fortunate fans. ""I do what I can to pump the kids up,"" Savage said. ""I'm still on their team even though they can't tag me in for this fight."" Savage also brought old Wrestlemania videos to watch with Tyler. ""My eyes and my bones and everything aches,"" Tyler said. ""I just want to sleep."" Earlier in the afternoon, Savage lifted the boy's arm in the air to show that he had won a mock wrestling match, then ran circles around the room, slapping his own face. ""Tyler's bone marrow is so damaged that there is almost no blood clotting, so the slightest touch will leave substantial bruising,"" said Tyler's doctor, pediatric oncologist Suri Prendesh. ""It's also best that Tyler avoid any more playful Savage Elbows or Scoop Slams."" Though Tyler had been showing signs of improvement, doctors feared Macho Man's ""unending"" boasts and product plugs were trying the boy's already-weak immune system.

""I don't like when he sings his songs,"" Tyler said, referring to Savage's impromptu performance of songs from his rap album Be A Man. ""They make me sad."" The Blashocks said they were initially relieved when Savage sprinted out of the room at 10 p.m., but his absence was short- lived. ""We thought it was the end of the ordeal,"" Mr. Blashock said. ""But sure enough, 15 minutes later, we hear, 'All right, Tyler, let's clothesline this cancer,' and we knew tomorrow was going to be another day that our son wouldn't be able to swallow any food.""

3229,Parasite Regrets Choosing Adam Carolla As Host,"LOS ANGELES'Just two weeks after settling on Adam Carolla as its next host, a Los Angeles'area hookworm whose lifecycle depends on the performance of the comic personality's digestive system said it is beginning to question Carolla's ability to stay fresh and produce consistent, quality nutrients on a daily basis. ""It doesn't take much to be a decent host'you just have to sit there, generate a couple cell lines every few minutes, and let me systematically tunnel my way through your internal organs,"" said the Necator americanus hookworm, a 10-millimeter-long nematode parasite of the Ancylostomatidae family, from Carolla's small intestine Tuesday. ""I've been trying to suck the life out of Adam, but it's difficult when there's absolutely no life to work with,"" it added. The hookworm first came into contact with Carolla during his morning radio program, while Carolla was handling human fecal matter as part of a popular recurring segment on his show. The parasite immediately introduced itself into Carolla's bloodstream, and underwent a weeklong ""feeling-out process"" in order to familiarize itself with Carolla's circulatory system. In the following days, reports began to surface that the hookworm had officially attached itself to Carolla's intestinal wall for the remainder of its project. ""At the time, Adam seemed like a perfect fit,"" the hookworm said. ""All I was looking for was some new blood'a personality that I could immediately latch onto, someone with a lot of energy that I can really feed off of."" ""Also, I figured that, with Carolla, my telltale symptoms'low-order cognitive impairment, a calloused rash on the palm of his right hand where I penetrated the skin, and mild itching and irritation of the anus'would go virtually unnoticed,"" it added. Yet the hookworm would soon express regret for choosing the ""first host [it] found,"" wishing that it had followed its original plan of overseeing a long and more thorough selection process. According to the hookworm, nearly everything that crosses Carolla's lips is either bland, disgusting, or completely and utterly tasteless. ""His bodily instincts are way off, he has no idea how to keep the juices flowing smoothly in his digestive tract, and even his best cell material is weak,"" said the hookworm, who was warned by a tapeworm that tried out Carolla as a host from 2002 to 2003 that he is ""an acquired taste."" ""His timing and delivery of antigens seem forced and almost totally random, and he never reacts to any of the simple metabolic waste products I'm constantly feeding him. And they're good, solid metabolic waste products, too,"" it said. The hookworm also assailed Carolla's ""predictable"" routine. ""Every time I burrow a hole through his stomach lining, I can sense the same tired, worn-out immune-system response coming from a mile away,"" said the parasite, who was similarly critical of Carolla's inability to endure three or four hours of host duties ""without just falling flat on his face."" ""I never thought I would say this, but after having to interact with Adam Carolla for two months, I long for the days when I was living in human shit,"" it said. The parasite, however, hinted that Carolla would likely ""not last very long"" as a host, noting that it had perforated Carolla's lungs, blocked blood flow to his liver, triggered a massive iron deficiency, depressed his immune system, and destroyed blood cells at such a rapid rate that Carolla is beginning to display early symptoms of aplastic anemia. ""I think it's safe to say that he'll be gone by December,"" the hookworm said.","entertainment, health, celebrities, science, tv, disease, news, vol 42 issue 35, entertainment"
3230,10 O'Clock News Team Relying Heavily On Work Of 6 O'Clock News Team,"AMARILLO, TX'Despite claims from the TV news outlet to offer ""nonstop news"" and ""coverage you can count on,"" an Onion investigation has uncovered hundreds of instances in which KAMR Channel 4 10 O'Clock Eyewitness News team relied almost exclusively on news reports, weather forecasts, and even special-interest features already generated by the station's 6 O'Clock Eyewitness News team. In an examination of 98 consecutive prime-time and late-night broadcasts, including dozens more nationwide, the Amarillo-based station'the region's self-styled ""News Leader""'repeatedly ran pieces for its Health Beat, Pet Patrol, and Bargain Busters segments in both evening news slots, and regularly relayed the same weather updates and traffic reports up to 15 times a day. KAMR even routinely rehashed 6 p.m. footage for seemingly urgent ""breaking news"" reports, most recently the Plum Creek Nursing Home power outage and the Bonham Middle School roof collapse. In an April incident involving the 10 p.m. recap of a local Cancer Fun Run, anchor Andy Justus read almost the exact same copy introducing the piece as he had just four hours earlier, while reporter Shalandys Anderson altered only one word between broadcasts, changing ""heartwarming"" to ""inspiring."" ""If they're 'on our side,' as they claim, what, then, is a purportedly professional news team doing in the four hours between broadcasts?"" Amarillo resident and frequent local-news viewer Mark Jette said. During another 10 p.m. broadcast, ""live continuing coverage"" from reporter Matt Orlando of a two-alarm Elwood Park house fire consisted almost wholly of previously aired footage of the firefighters in action. The lack of updated footage disappointed viewers such as Hereford, TX's Kelly Byer, whose mild curiosity about the blaze, first piqued at the 6 p.m. newscast, went ungratified. ""It's true that the image of that scorched little doll was powerful and may have bore repeating, but where was the follow-up footage of the devastated family at a Red Cross shelter?"" Byer said. ""Or some fresh b-roll of the charred ruins of the house? The public deserves better."" The investigation also found the 10 p.m. KAMR broadcast consistently re-aired closing stock numbers and high-school baseball highlights and sports bloopers, its producers and anchors apparently unaware or indifferent to the fact that the information was hours old and already common knowledge among viewers. ""They say that the 6 o'clock news team is 'the area's most watched news team',"" Jette said. ""Especially by the 10 o'clock news team."" Just last Tuesday, investigative reporter Meaghan Collier's ""Problem Solvers"" segment on squalid conditions at a local dog kennel aired again at 10 p.m. without even a cursory update on the broken-legged puppy featured in the report. ""Their 'Scorching Summer' coverage was even worse,"" Jette continued. ""How many times do you have to repeat the same 'cool tips' before all of Amarillo is crystal clear on exactly how to beat the heat?"" While KAMR was a particularly flagrant offender, it is by no means alone. In a segment about the San Diego Zoo's baby pandas, KFMB- TV-8's News At 11 not only offered footage identical to the previous telecast, but practically indistinguishable coos of affection from the co-anchor. At some stations, the problem goes far beyond one-time reuse. An 11 p.m. segment on heart-smart dinner alternatives on New Haven, Connecticut's WTNH Channel 8 was not only previously seen on the 6 p.m. news, but also on Live At 5, The 4 Report, and The News At Noon With Sonia Baghdady. Another piece on the city's aging school buses was rotated into the following day's Good Morning New Haven! as well. In extreme examples, such as in Louisville, KY's WLKY-TV prime-time and late-night newscasts, the only distinguishable characteristic is the lead anchor's concluding suggestion to ""stay tuned for [David Letterman's] The Late Show."" Despite the mounting controversy over the KAMR Channel 4 team, the investigation was unable to conclusively prove that the hopeful wishes to see viewers the next day, and the camaraderie and laughter shared between co-anchors Kyla Cullinane and Elizabeth Dinh, were anything less than genuine.","entertainment, media, television, weather, news, vol 42 issue 35, entertainment"

3236,New Oliver Stone 9/11 Film Introduces 'Single Plane' Theory,"NEW YORK'Academy Award-winning director Oliver Stone said Monday that his new film World Trade Center unveils ""compelling and controversial"" new evidence that a single plane was responsible for all four collisions in New York, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania on Sept. 11, 2001. ""Get ready to go through the looking glass here, people,"" Stone told reporters at a Manhattan press conference before an advance screening of the movie, which premieres Wednesday. ""The film you are about to see is going to blow the lid off the 9/11 Commission's official report and expose a conspiracy that reaches the highest levels of government."" World Trade Center, which stars Nicolas Cage as a dedicated Port Authority officer who stumbles on secret evidence amid the rubble and carnage of the terrorist attack, tells a story quite different from what Stone called ""the official government line"" about the event. According to the film, at 8:46 a.m., a lone commercial airliner flew diagonally through the North Tower of the World Trade Center, maintained a circular holding pattern for approximately 17 minutes, then struck the South Tower before heading to the Pentagon. After its collision with the center of American military operations, the so-called ""magic plane""'which variously and ingeniously identified itself to air-traffic controllers as ""American Airlines Flight 11,"" ""United Airlines Flight 175,"" ""American Airlines Flight 77"" and ""United Airlines Flight 93""'took to the skies once again, landing at a top-secret ""black-ops"" Air Force base in West Virginia, where it was reloaded with a group of clones from another shadowy government program that Stone described as ""shocking."" Stone, who said he did not have time to explore the clone angle in the three-and-a-half-hour film, plans to do so in the sequel, September 12. In a gripping sequence, undercover agents transmit pre-recorded cell-phone messages intended to fool loved ones and relatives with a false cover story as the aircraft heads to its final, prearranged crash site in the fields of southwestern Pennsylvania. Viewers of the advance screening agreed that the most striking and pivotal scene was Cage's character's discovery of security-camera footage that affirmed the single-plane theory. Showing his skeptical but supportive wife the footage frame by frame, Cage notices that the so-called ""first"" plane, which, according to official, whitewashed reports, detonated upon impact with the North Tower in the initial collision, actually banks ""back and to the left, circling for about 17 minutes, and then diving into the other tower."" He repeats the phrase over and over in increasing intensity, toggling back and forth between individual frames while the music swells and the emotional drama rises to a fever pitch. ""After seeing that sequence, there's no way anyone can ever deny again that there was only one plane in the airspace over the eastern seaboard that morning,"" Stone said. ""I am the most important filmmaker working today,"" he added. Early public reaction to the film has been skeptical. Many 9/11 conspiracy theorists claim Stone is presenting an exploitative, far-fetched, and manipulative Hollywood version of the pain and suffering'including eye strain and carpal tunnel syndrome'they have undergone during their countless hours on the Internet in the tragedy's aftermath. Despite the controversy, Stone stands by his film. ""This is a story that needs to be told, in a reality that only I can bring to the big screen,"" Stone said. ""I realize it will be hard to accept for those unable to confront the truth, but I can't hide my head in the sand like some goddamn ostrich. To sin by silence when we should protest makes cowards out of men.""","entertainment, movies, terrorism, news, vol 42 issue 32, entertainment"

3247,Jon Lovitz Says Income From Subway Commercials Allows Him A Certain Creative Freedom,"LOS ANGELES'Jon Lovitz, former Saturday Night Live cast member and star of TV's The Critic and NewsRadio, is taping a scene from his latest Subway commercial on a Burbank soundstage. To the casual onlooker, his work has seemed consistently competent, even polished. But the consummate perfectionist insists on yet another take. 'I think I can really nail it this time,' Lovitz tells the weary director and crew. It's almost 10 p.m. The shoot, originally slated for four hours, has stretched to nearly 12. 'Eat fresh,' Lovitz says, comically drawing out the 'H'-sound. 'Yeah. We got it. I think that's the one.' One may wonder why Jon Lovitz, an established star with a lengthy list of film and TV credits, would need to do a commercial for a fast-food chain. The ultimate benefit, Lovitz explained, was 'a certain creative freedom.' 'These Subway ads allow me to choose the more cutting-edge projects I've always wanted to do,' Lovitz said. 'Subway has basically freed me artistically.' For example, without Subway, the opportunity to voice a talking penguin in the new Bob Saget animated mockumentary Farce Of The Penguins might have never come up'or worse, proved too big a gamble, Lovitz said. 'It could be a big flop or a big hit, but none of that really matters,' Lovitz said. 'It's more about the quality of the work and the company you keep. The opportunity to work with Dave Coulier, Jimmy Belushi, and [Counting Crows front-man] Adam Duritz was incentive enough, but when the Saget calls, you come running. Even after reading the script, though, I just knew. I said, 'This is exactly the kind of risky material I want to take on'.' The Benchwarmers, another labor of love Lovitz said he wouldn't have been able to take part in without his income from the Subway campaign, was challenging, but ultimately 'what being an artist and entertainer is all about.' 'It was a chance to tell a very small story without all the Hollywood glitz,' Lovitz said. 'The highly nuanced part I played'a billionaire surrounded by Star Wars figurines'was difficult because I had to find the source of his humanity.' 'I had so many fascinating conversations with Dave Spade, Rob [Schneider], and Craiggers [Craig Kilborn] about our scenes together, and what kind of message we wanted to send,' Lovitz added. The Subway ads couldn't have come at a better time for the former red M&M, who was weary from years of acting stints that didn't use his talents to the fullest. 'The 'Eat' campaign really put me on the map,' Lovitz said. 'And now I can really pick and choose my roles.' In April, Putt-Pal USA signed Lovitz to endorse its Green Brushes product line for a sum significantly lower than his Subway salary. Lovitz leapt at the chance to endorse the device, saying it would 'bring a little-publicized problem to the tri-state area's attention.' 'Endorsing the Green Brushes is worth it because it is something I genuinely believe in,' Lovitz said. 'Not that I don't believe in Subway'after all, six grams of fat for a six-inch sub is pretty remarkable'but removing debris from putting greens is something very close to my heart.' Doing commercials is also a way of getting back to his roots as a performer, and it's clear that Lovitz still relishes those early days in which his raw talent first found its voice'namely, a 1982 spot for Bakersfield, CA-based Eagle Vinyl Siding. 'I've achieved a lot in my career, but no matter how much I mature creatively, I find that in everything I do, I'm essentially trying to get back to the hunger, spark, and enthusiasm of the work I first fell in love with,' Lovitz said. 'I might never be able to truly do that, but I can at least try to give something back. And on my own terms.' Truly a man for all seasons, Lovitz has several diverse projects planned, including a spot for a local Cajun restaurant in his hometown, Tarzana, CA, and a special appearance at Ready Radials, where he regularly purchases tires. In September, Lovitz will embark on his most ambitious effort yet: Directing his first Subway commercial, with veteran Subway pitchman Jared Fogle making his long-awaited return.","entertainment, celebrities, subway, fast food, art, news, vol 42 issue 24, entertainment"

3253,Insecure Brian Williams Only One Who Doesn't Trust Brian Williams For Latest News,"NEW YORK'Although he is the most watched and widely recognized newscaster on American network television, NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams continues to be plagued with crippling self-doubt, admitting Monday that he would look to ""just about anyone else"" for in-depth analysis of the latest national and international news before himself. ""There are times when I truly believe that for solid, up-to-the-minute coverage that goes beyond the headlines to make sense of the events that shape our world, Americans are better off asking literally any random person on the street,"" the 46-year-old broadcaster said. Williams was dismissive of the fact that, as the former chief White House correspondent and host of The News With Brian Williams on MSNBC and later CNBC, he was the clear choice to replace retiring Nightly News anchor Tom Brokaw, alleging that, ""at least Brokaw knew what the fuck he was doing half the time."" ""More Americans tune in to NBC Nightly News than any other network news show. Don't they know I'm on against World News Tonight, with Elizabeth Vargas? She's really got her shit together,"" said Williams, who characterized his prestigious, nearly quarter-century career in television news as ""a complete fluke"" and ""certainly not anything that had to do with me."" Williams, who has been hailed as the new dean of network news journalists by several prominent TV critics and attacked as a ""giant phony"" by his own mind, is confident of only one thing: When breaking news happens, viewers can count on Brian Williams to be at a total loss as to why, out of all the other television journalists available, he was chosen to deliver it. ""What business did I have in Banda Aceh after the 2004 tsunami, trying to give viewers a sense of the overwhelming catastrophe that had just taken place?"" Williams said. ""I couldn't even figure out how to button that stupid little khaki vest,  let alone trying to put into perspective the incalculable loss of one of history's most horrendous disasters."" Known for his relentless pursuit of the truth, particularly when standing before his bathroom mirror each morning, Williams has a long track record of asking the tough questions other news anchors are unwilling to ask themselves. Among his most hard-hitting inquiries include, ""Brian Williams, who do you think you are, anyway?"" and ""Do you have any idea just how much you suck?"" ""Last night, we explored the misappropriation of federal funds during our 'Fleecing Of America' segment,"" Williams said. ""Do you know what would've made a better subject? 'Brian Williams: The Sham To End All Shams.'"" While Williams' insecurities may come as a surprise to viewers who regularly watch the outwardly calm and confident newsman, those behind the scenes at NBC Nightly News are all too aware of the anchor's lack of self-confidence. ""I used to like the fact that Brian wasn't arrogant and smug like some other on-air personalities I've dealt with,"" said Eve Hodel, a makeup specialist who works on several NBC News shows. ""But his constant need for validation is tiring. I try my best to reassure him that his reports are balanced, articulate, and thought-provoking, but he never believes it."" Nightly News intern Jared Kampmann echoed Hodel's observation. ""This morning, he asked me if his piece on the looming threat of war with Iran was 'Brokaw-worthy,'""said Kampmann.

3259,Is Opening Week Too Soon To See A 9/11 Movie?,"Has enough time passed since we first witnessed the awful event of the United 93 trailer to confront the full-length movie of United 93 in its opening week? April 4, 2006 was the day Americans learned about the existence of United 93 by viewing the new preview. And in that moment,  frozen in time, what had once seemed impossible'a filmed reenactment of the events of 9/11'became all too frighteningly real. Millions of Americans went about their daily concerns that fateful day, unaware that our lives as movie-watchers were about to change forever. We would watch in terror on April 28, the film's release date, suspending our disbelief as best we could, unable to face the reality that a feature-length film about the terrorist attacks on America had indeed taken place before our eyes. Are we ready to relive the most dramatized strike on American soil since the movie Pearl Harbor? Or will United 93 stir up the deep, unresolved feelings we've had bottled up for the last three weeks or so? Maybe these questions would be easier for me to answer if I hadn't known one of the gaffers from the movie about that flight. For me, opening week may prove to be too soon. I may have to wait till the second or third week of its release. Yet we must remember the brave actors and actresses who boarded United 93's commercial-airliner set, whose artistic sacrifice ultimately cost them months of their lives, and ask ourselves what they would have wanted. Wouldn't they have wanted us to see the movie on the opening day? Wouldn't they have wanted this movie to have the highest possible first-weekend gross? Director Paul Greengrass, for example, has been said to be suffering from post-production-stress disorder. It could be argued that this is a time for all American moviegoers to come together and stand united in support of the filmmaking heroes who stood up when this project was greenlit and said, ""Let's roll."" But for some of us, it would be easier to pretend its theatrical release had never happened and wait until United 93 makes its way to DVD in a couple of months. Am I taking my freedom to see this movie for granted? After all, the men and women involved in this filmed catastrophe didn't have the choice to walk off the set. They were just extras in the tragedy, and exercising such freedom would have ended their careers then and there.  It just goes to show you that life is precious, and that one never knows when one's last moments on camera will come. Regardless of when or where I ultimately see this film, one thing remains certain: We live in a post-United 93 world now, and as American moviegoers it is our duty to remain vigilant in hopes of preventing these events, or a sequel to them, from ever happening again.","opinion, entertainment, movies, terrorism, commentary, vol 42 issue 17, marissa springer, entertainment"
3260,Scholars Discover 23 Blank Pages That May As Well Be Lost Samuel Beckett Play,"PARIS'Just weeks after the centennial of the birth of pioneering minimalist playwright Samuel Beckett, archivists analyzing papers from his Paris estate uncovered a small stack of blank paper that scholars are calling ""the latest example of the late Irish-born writer's genius."" The 23 blank pages, which literary experts presume is a two-act play composed sometime between 1973 and 1975, are already being heralded as one of the most ambitious works by the Nobel Prize-winning author of Waiting For Godot, and a natural progression from his earlier works, including 1969's Breath, a 30-second play with no characters, and 1972's Not I, in which the only illuminated part of the stage is a floating mouth. ""In what was surely a conscious decision by Mr. Beckett, the white, uniform, non-ruled pages, which symbolize the starkness and emptiness of life, were left unbound, unmarked, and untouched,"" said Trinity College professor of Irish literature Fintan O'Donoghue. ""And, as if to further exemplify the anonymity and facelessness of 20th-century man, they were found, of all places, between other sheets of paper."" ""I can only conclude that we have stumbled upon something quite remarkable,"" O'Donoghue added. According to literary critic Eric Matheson, who praised the work for ""the bare-bones structure and bleak repetition of what can only be described as 'nothingness,'"" the play represents somewhat of a departure from the works of Beckett's ""middle period."" But, he said, it ""might as well be Samuel Beckett at his finest."" ""It does feature certain classic Beckett elements, such as sparse stage directions, a mysterious quality of anonymity, a slow building of tension with no promise of relief, and an austere portrayal of the human condition,"" Matheson said. ""But Beckett's traditional intimation of an unrelenting will to live, the possibility of escape from the vacuous indifference that surrounds us'that's missing. Were that his vision, I suspect he would have used perforated paper."" Scholars theorize that the 23-page play might have been intended to be titled Five Conversations, Entropolis, or Stop. In addition, an 81-page document, also blank, was found, which, for all intents and purposes, could be an earlier draft of the work. ""I suspect this was a nascent stream-of-consciousness attempt,"" O'Donoghue said of the blank sheets of paper, which were found scattered among Beckett's personal effects and took a Beckett scholar four painstaking days to put into the correct order. ""In his final version, Beckett used his trademark style of 'paring down' to really get at the core of what he was trying to not say."" Some historians, however, contend that the play could have been the work of one of Beckett's protégés. ""Even though the central theme and wicked sense of humor of this piece would lead one to believe that this could conceivably be a vintage Beckett play, in reality, it could just as easily have been the product of [Beckett's close friend] Rick Cluchey,"" biographer Neal Gleason said. ""And if it was Beckett, it's not outside the realm of possibility that, given his sharp wit, it was just intended as a joke. If Beckett were alive today, he might insist that it's not even a play at all. It could be a novella, or a screenplay."" Enthusiasts still maintain that the ""nuances, subtleties, and allusions to his previous works"" are all unmistakably Beckett. They also claim to have found notes and ideas for this play in the margins of Beckett's earlier works. There are already plans to stage the play during the intermission of an upcoming production of Waiting For Godot.","entertainment, books, news, vol 42 issue 17, entertainment"

3268,Sitcom Writer On Deathbed Thinks Of All The Zany Plots He'll Never Write,"BURBANK, CA'Days after doctors at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center told him he had less than two months to live, sitcom writer Joey Kaplan expressed regret that he never accomplished all he could have in his series. ""I had so many plans for my show, so many dream sequences yet to fulfill,"" said Kaplan, co-creator and executive producer of the CBS sitcom Still Standing, which focuses on the domestic life of Chicago father Bill Miller, his wife Judy, and children Brian and Lauren. ""But it was always the same thing: 'I'll do it next season.'"" Though Kaplan, who has advanced lymphoma, made it through 82 episodes of the show, a fixture on CBS's Monday-night lineup, he still laments the fact that he will never get to take his sitcom family to Florida for a Disney vacation episode, watch Brian reach adulthood and get his first apartment in what he assumed was an upscale loft but is actually a condemned property, or witness Judy giving birth to a healthy baby boy while stuck in an elevator. ""It hurts to think of all the half-hours wasted on routine plots,"" said an emotional Kaplan. ""All the class reunions, forgotten anniversaries, new neighbors, bouts of amnesia, living-room weddings, surprise inheritances from distant relatives that end up being worthless, and blind dates disrupted by the meddlesome dad that I'm going to miss out on when I'm gone."" Added Kaplan, ""It's tragic to know I'll never hear the sound of canned laughter again."" Kaplan says he has lately found comfort in favorite passages from his series bible. ""I take solace in the words and one-liners of Jesús, the ribald Mexican delivery guy whom I now wish could have been a larger presence in my show,"" Kaplan said. ""I never got the chance to tell him how important he was to the series."" According to caretakers at his Burbank hospice, Kaplan spends much of his time watching videos of his sitcom family and friends. ""Joey wishes he'd gotten to know his characters more, especially the kids,"" said patient-care coordinator Rosalba Cruz. ""We all try to tell him that we're sure he did everything he could for them, and that they're all better off for being created by him."" ""Look at little Brian here,"" Kaplan said, watching the show's nerdy overachieving son take his very first steps on-screen through a swinging kitchen door. ""I'll never forget the first thing he said: 'Dad, what do you do to impress a girl?' As I recall, Bill's response had something to do with belching."" Kaplan tearfully rued living ""episode to episode"" rather than focusing on the big series picture. ""My characters made lots of friends'like the kindly old man at the senior center who turned out to be Santa Claus'but they never kept in touch with them for more than one show,"" he said. ""And why did I make Bill so self-absorbed and childish? Sometimes I wish I could reach into that TV and shake the living daylights out of him. That's a beautiful, beautiful family he has, but all he ever thinks about is beer and sports."" Still Standing co-creator Diane Burroughs has promised to carry on with the show, starting with a ""very special"" episode based on Kaplan's terminal illness. ""Bill misunderstands a doctor's diagnosis and thinks he's going to die, so he goes on a mad spree,"" Burroughs said. ""Long story short, he maxes out the credit card and breaks his leg skydiving. This is for you, Joey."" Kaplan said he just hopes the children he and Burroughs created will someday grow up to have children of their own during a flash-forward fantasy episode.","entertainment, tv, news, vol 42 issue 13, entertainment"

3280,I Don't Wonder What Jesse Camp Is Up To These Days,"Hey, you know who I haven't been thinking about lately? That guy Jesse Camp who I never used to watch on MTV. I don't fondly remember him winning MTV's ""I Wanna Be A VJ"" competition back in 1998. It wasn't kind of cool that he came out of nowhere to beat out 4,000 other more qualified hopefuls for the job. I really wasn't rooting for him to succeed from the beginning, and it's not too bad that his star has faded. Not looking back on Jesse Camp's time in the spotlight, I'm certainly not going to speculate about what's become of him today. I genuinely didn't think that there were big things ahead for him. And I don't remember hearing that he got a record deal or something'or maybe it was that I didn't hear that he decided to take up acting. Come not to think of it, this really isn't an interesting question. And you know what? I didn't ever hear that he had a cameo in some Britney Spears movie. I don't wonder how old Jesse Camp is now, either'25, or 30? Boy, that doesn't make you think. I don't hope he's gotten his life together and maybe started a family. Then again, I ignore the possibility that he got hooked on drugs and booze. With the way some people respond to fame, I certainly don't care to take the time to doubt it. When you don't think about it, it's not kind of sad certain celebrities fade into obscurity. I guess it's just not an unfortunate byproduct of our media-saturated culture that the media knocks stars like him down just seconds after they make them. In this case, one simply doesn't wonder. If you ask me, it's not about time that celebrities like Jesse Camp get the respect they don't deserve. Because, really, in their own small way, Jesse Camp and people like him don't contribute to our cultural landscape. Sure, there are shows like The Surreal Life, which I admit I have not been sucked into watching on numerous occasions, but that only covers a handful of the former stars who I can't help not wondering about. Man. Not thinking about all these people who were once in the limelight really doesn't make me think about my own life. What if I don't contribute anything of value to my culture, too? Will people still not think about me long after I'm dead? Then again, who am I not to say. It's like I can control it. I don't think that's what it comes down to, and that's the reason why I can really not relate to guys like Jesse Camp. And I guess that's why I'm so uninterested in what his life is like now. You know what programming executives should really not consider? Making a whole bunch more of those ""where are they now?""-type shows to keep us up to date on our old non-favorites. Because, hey, who doesn't want to know what happened to the red-haired kid from The Adventures Of Pete And Pete? Me. And I bet you anything the rest of America doesn't, too.","opinion, entertainment, commentary, vol 42 issue 06, lucy crockett, entertainment"

3295,New Video Game Designed To Have No Influence On Kids' Behavior,"NEW YORK' Electronic-entertainment giant Take-Two Interactive, parent company of Grand Theft Auto series creator Rockstar Games, released Stacker Tuesday, a first-person vertical-crate-arranger guaranteed not to influence young people's behavior in any way. ""With Stacker, the player interacts with an environment full of boxes'lightweight, uniformly brown boxes with rounded corners'and uses diligence and repetitive hard work to complete his mission,"" said Doug Benzies, Stacker's chief developer. ""We're confident that the new 'reluctantly interactive' content engine we designed will prevent any excitement or emotional involvement, inappropriate or otherwise, on the part of the player."" To avoid any appearance of suggestive or adult situations, the graphics consist entirely of rectangular polygons rendered in shades of brown against a simulated gray cinderblock wall. The game is free-roaming inside the warehouse environment, meaning that no goals are set for stacking a certain number of boxes, nor is there a time limit for the stacking. The health-level bar remains at a constant peak, and the first-person perspective avoids the problem of players identifying too closely with the main character, whose name is never specified and to whom nothing actually happens. While the game, like most other newer entries, has a three-dimensional platform, it features little else that could make an impression on the player. ""We tried to narrow in on anything that could imply suggestive content, and eliminate it,"" Benzies said. ""Sound effects are limited to the barely audible sounds of scraping cardboard, the dull thuds of boxes against cement, and the white noise of a cavernous workplace setting."" A demo version of Stacker was unveiled at the Tokyo Game Show in September and garnered praise from parents' groups who lauded its unstimulating visuals, utter lack of storyline, and non-immersive game play. ""After playing Stacker, there is absolutely no reason for anyone to want to take boxes, crates, or any other polygonal object, and place them atop one another, as seen in this gem of a game,"" said Laura Keitel of the D.C.-based Center For Entertainment And The Family. ""No kid in the world could possibly get anything out of it. There's no reason why the video-game industry shouldn't be making a lot more games like this."" Take-Two executives said they were inspired by ""real critics."" ""We're just giving kids what their parents say they need,"" said Take-Two vice president of marketing Allyson Spicer. ""In today's economic environment, it's foolish not to listen to the people who dislike everything about our products."" Though some have compared Stacker to Tetris, those within the industry have been quick to draw distinctions between the two games. ""Tetris' suggestively twisting and turning blocks, violent falling motions, and increasingly frenzied suspense are a potential influence on children,"" said video-game ethicist Steve Contreras. ""By contrast, after playing Stacker, with its eternally unchanging shapes and gentle lowering actions, I doubt a child would ever want to arrange any sort of virtual block again. This is exactly what this controversial industry needed to rescue its reputation."" Added Contreras: ""We could really use a good first-person stander game."" Yet several parents of teenagers who work in warehouses and box factories are already threatening Take-Two with civil lawsuits, claiming that Stacker may adversely affect children of low-income workers. ""My kid certainly doesn't want to stack cases of instant coffee in a hot warehouse all day, like his old man did,"" said Loretto, PA father Reginald Hauser. ""Now they're saying there's a video game that might glamorize the activity. Those video-game honchos are up to the same old tricks.""","entertainment, kids, video games, news, vol 45 issue 01, entertainment"
3296,My Songs About Topsoil Say What I Can't,"I'm not much of a talker. Never have been. But that doesn't mean I don't have a lot to say. It's just that, sometimes, I can't communicate what I'm trying to say with just words. I guess that's just how I am. I was only 8 when we moved to the farm in North Dakota, but even then I had certain feelings about the topsoil'feelings that I did not know how to express. Back then, I didn't know where the emotions came from, much less how to put them into words. I was young, and had a lot to learn about myself, and even more about the chocolate brown soil that kept a whole mess of good people fed. When I was a teenager, my feelings about the topsoil grew more intense. In my head, I saw just what I wanted to express as plain as day, but every time I tried to talk it out, it came out wrong. During this time, I hurt some people, but really I was only hurting myself. Without a way to channel my feelings, I spent most of my time brooding, stealing whiskey from my folks, getting into fights, and sometimes even cutting myself just to stop the pain inside. As I lie in bed at night, my feelings for the black, nitrogen-rich soil were so strong it seemed like they would burst out of my chest. It wasn't until my cousin Jimmy came to live with us that I saw a new path. Cousin Jimmy didn't bring much with him but a sack half full of clothes and a battered old guitar. After a couple weeks of bugging him, he taught me a few chords, and before a week was out, I spent more time with that guitar than he did. Over the years, I picked up a few more things, but I didn't need a lot of fancy learning to say what I needed to say about soil so rich you could put it to seed pretty much forever, as long as you correctly rotate the crops. And I just started to sing. I started to sing about the topsoil, what it means to me, what feelings I had when I weeded it, everything. I don't even remember the words. All I remember was that it was like the song was just pouring out of me and it wouldn't stop. It was scary, but it felt right. One of the pivotal moments of my life was the afternoon I played my first show at a Future Farmers of America convention. Some of the kids got it and some didn't, but I knew I was onto something when almost every single adult came up to me after the show with tears in their eyes, telling me, ""You really said it."" I had put into song something they'd felt their whole lives. One of those guys, Ned Rembach, even picked up his old banjo and started playing music again. He opens for me sometimes. He does a couple songs about detasseling corn that never leave a dry eye in the house. It's funny when I look back at some of those early songs, like ""Don't Blow Away (Don't Leave Me),"" ""Ten-Pound Fertilizer,"" and ""Terra Cotta Planter (Alone In My Room),"" I realize how simple the songs I was writing back then were. They had a certain charm, but as I've gotten older, my feelings toward topsoil have gotten more complex. So has my music. It used to be real simple folk and country blues stuff. The latest song, ""Dirt Anchor,"" has a real jazzy feel to it with some complex horn charts that say more about my complex relationship with the dirt than anything else I've ever done. Of course, I still struggle with my art. A couple of years ago, I was getting to the point where I thought I had said all I could say with music. Even so, my love for the soil still burned inside me. So I took a little break and went back to the family farm and started doing some abstract paintings. Two years and hundreds of dollars in burnt-umber acrylic paint later, I felt I had become pretty accomplished as a painter even though most people were more confused than excited by my richly textured, brown works. The way I figure it, that's all a part of the creative process. Ever since that hiatus, I've come back to music feeling fully recharged, ready to dig deep and explore some feelings about topsoil I never even knew I had. I've had so much creative juice that I started a band just to perform my free-form, red-clay-soil compositions. We're called the Red Clay Rumblers, and we play Freddy's on Tuesdays, so come on out and see us. We've got T-shirts that sum up my ideology: When dirt is your muse, inspiration is only a few steps away.","opinion, entertainment, human interest, music, rural, commentary, vol 41 issue 49, jack richland, entertainment"

3298,Rest Of U2 Perfectly Fine With Africans Starving,"SAN FRANCISCO'Rock band U2, currently on tour in North America, is well-known for its human-rights advocacy, particularly its ongoing campaign to eradicate poverty in Africa. Less known to fans of the Irish supergroup, however, is that the lion's share of these efforts are made by lead singer Bono. The three other U2 members are perfectly okay with the dismal plight of Africa's poor. ""Yeah, that Africa stuff is Bono's thing,"" The Edge said. ""I don't mind if he pursues other interests, but I really try to focus on the guitar riffs that give U2 its characteristic sound."" Bassist Adam Clayton, while ""not opposed"" to Bono's tireless efforts to improve the quality of life for impoverished Third World citizens, is apparently too busy to spearhead an anti-poverty initiative of his own. ""I was happy to help out with the Live 8 thing,"" said Clayton, referring to the July mega-concert benefit. ""But ever since I discovered rock 'n' roll in the mid-'70s, music has been my passion, and I'd be lying if I said it was something different, like helping people."" Clayton added: ""I don't have a problem with [Bono] trying to save Africa. Who knows, it might inspire some decent songs. But just as long as it doesn't interfere with the band."" In 2002, Bono started an organization called Debt, AIDS, Trade, Africa to raise awareness of the deep health and economic crises that cripple much of the continent. His fellow bandmates, however, do not lose any sleep over the debt crisis facing many African nations. ""If I could wave a magic wand and cure Africa's problems, I would do that,"" drummer Larry Mullen Jr. said. ""But someone has to take care of the more practical, day-to-day stuff that Bono doesn't really bother with. Like, for example, how's the next album going to sound? How're we going to keep our live act fresh? I can't tell you how many millions of decisions go into making one Elevation tour."" Mullen added: ""You don't win 14 Grammys feeding Africans."" In the rare moment they have free, Clayton, Mullen, and The Edge said they choose to relax and rejuvenate, without letting the plight of Africa's starving and disease-afflicted millions weigh too heavily on their minds. ""I have a garden to tend to when we're not on the road,"" The Edge said. ""There's nothing wrong with taking care of your own little corner of the world. I work very hard in my garden."" When asked their opinion about Bono's prospects of being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize within the next year, the music-playing part of U2 could not stifle their groans. ""We had a big scare last year when [Bono's] name was put forward as the new president of the World Bank,"" Clayton said. ""I mean, I have nothing against it, but it would just be more work for us, because we'd be left with the very challenging task of finding a new lead singer."" During live concerts, U2 audiences are treated to a stunning audiovisual experience, with Bono periodically giving his opinion on social and world events between songs. During these interludes, the rest of U2 is often conspicuously silent. ""When Bono starts telling the audience how messed up the world can be and how we should work together to make things better, I usually just zone out,"" Mullen said.","entertainment, africa, perspectives, news, vol 41 issue 49, entertainment"

3303,FCC: All Programming To Be Broadcast In ADHDTV By 2007,"WASHINGTON, DC'The Federal Communications Commission voted 3-1 Monday to require electronics manufacturers to make all television sets ADHD-compatible within two years. To adhere to the guidelines, every program, with the exception of The Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi Show, will have to be sped up to meet the new standard frame rate of 120 frames per second. FCC Chairman Kevin Martin characterized the move as ""a natural, forward-thinking response to the changing needs of the average American viewer."" ""In the media-saturated climate of the modern age, few have the time and energy to sit still for an entire episode of King Of Queens,"" Martin said. ""Although the FCC will leave it up to the television networks to make the necessary programming changes, we are recommending, in accordance with the ADHDTV standard, that all shows be no more than six minutes in length, and that they contain jarring and unpredictable camera cuts to shiny props and detailed background sets."" ""We're also advising that intra-episode recaps occur every 45 seconds,"" he added. The ruling represents a growing shift toward ADHDTV, a television format designed to meet the needs of an increasingly inattentive and hyperactive audience. The tuner includes a built-in device that automatically changes channels after three minutes of uninterrupted single-station viewing, as well as a picture-in-picture-in-picture-in-picture option. According to Sony, the leading manufacturer of the ADHD-compatible sets, the new technology will allow viewers to play up to three simultaneous video games while watching television. ""Many of our ADHDTVs will come with a motorized base,"" Sony spokesperson Richard O'Dell said. ""In the event that the viewer turns his attention away from the television, it will begin to rotate and emit sirens and piercing shrieks."" The mandate to conform to the new format has already been met with some resistance, particularly from movie channels like HBO, live programs such as ABC's Monday Night Football, and the History Channel, whose ambitious five-part, 10-hour historical documentary about World War II, slated for completion in late 2007, will have to be shortened to a six-minute montage of the war set to a medley of Ashlee Simpson hits. Some networks, however, are embracing the change. ""A majority of our shows are only watchable for a few minutes at a time anyway,"" said Fox president Peter Liguori, whose recently unveiled fall 2007 TV schedule includes over 850 new series. ""We're going to roll out an exciting lineup of major sporting-event highlights, late-night yell shows, and a brand-new season of The O.C. that will feature 37 new characters and'well, I don't want to give too much away, but let's just say it will have a lot more guys jumping up and down, saying, 'Hey! Hey! Look over here!'"" On standard 4:3 televisions, ADHDTV programs will be shown in letterbox format, with the top and bottom of the screen alternately filled with bright, flittering butterflies, undulating rainbow-colored patterns, and singing hamsters in top hats. Skeptics say the switch to ADHDTV will likely be delayed in favor of other projects or even completely forgotten by next week. However, the FDA is fast-tracking approval of the new drug Entertainalin, developed in anticipation of the modified programming. In clinical trials, the drug has been effective in helping viewers concentrate not only on the new TV format, but also on their immediate surroundings, the couch fabric, a dog passing by the window, and pieces of lint floating in the air.","entertainment, technology, tv, trends, advertising, news, vol 41 issue 47, entertainment"

3307,"Animal Planet Reality Show To Put Bear, Antelope, Hawk, Cheetah In Same House","LOS ANGELES'Cable network Animal Planet announced its most ambitious foray into reality-TV programming yet Monday with The Zoo, a weekly, hourlong show in which members of a diverse, all-animal cast square off in a single 3,200-square-foot home in the San Fernando Valley. ""Sparks'and fur'are sure to fly when animals from 11 different ecosystems share a single row house in trendy Echo Park,"" executive producer Stu Wolchek said. ""For many of these wild, colorful, and totally unpredictable cast members, it's the first time they've ever seen a bison or sloth."" Wolchek added: ""Some of these guys have never even lived under a roof."" According to the show's creator, former zoo director Loren De Jong, over 80 different species were auditioned to find the right mix of personalities. In addition to the red bear, African cheetah, hawk, and antelope, the house is occupied by an American bison, a field mouse, an Egyptian plover, a three-toed sloth, a goose, a crocodile, and a female lowland gorilla who is ""very territorial of the bathroom."" De Jong said the show's contestants begin forming alliances on the first day. ""We see an immediate alliance develop between the lowland gorilla and the bison, who work together to smash a hole through a wall,"" De Jong said. ""While the bear and crocodile are the first to assert themselves in the house, folks at home shouldn't forget the dark horse: the field mouse, who might just fly under the radar all the way to the finals,"" she added. TV Guide writer Rebecca Kohler is one of the few to have viewed the pilot. ""It's impossible to pick a winner this early on,"" Kohler said. ""The gorilla is clearly the game's strategist. At the same time, nothing happens in the house that the hawk doesn't see. And I wouldn't put it past the crocodile to eat his own young if it meant getting ahead."" Kohler said that the animal most likely to face early eviction is the sloth, who ""seems to lack the ambition necessary to go all the way."" The cast will compete in weekly immunity and reward challenges, with prizes comprising such creature comforts as straw, mud puddles, and tree trunks. The latter is much-desired for itch-relieving, horn-sharpening, and territory-marking alike. Animal Planet sources say the house, which is equipped with the latest in modern convenience, including a hot tub, a flat-screen TV, and a pool table, quickly fills with feces during the premiere episode. The cast will also take ""time outs"" in the house's soundproof confessional room, where they can ""privately come clean with any thoughts or instincts they may have."" ""You'll be shocked at some of the venting you'll hear in the confessional,"" Wolchek said. While the cast has reportedly had trouble with such competitions as bridge-building and cooperative puzzle-solving, repulsive-food competitions have proven ""very successful,"" with contestants eagerly devouring worms, beetles, and grubs. ""The hawk beat out his fellow housemates in a stomach-turning roundworm-eating contest,"" Wolchek said. ""He just swallowed those disgusting things whole, one by one. It all seemed worth it to him in the end, though, when he was awarded a sorely needed pile of branches to complete his nest."" Sources close to the show have hinted at the possibility of a 12th, surprise houseguest being thrown into the already cramped living quarters to ""shake things up"" during February sweeps. Unconfirmed rumors circulating on the Internet identify the mystery cast-member as a 23-year-old Asian-American marketing assistant. The winner of The Zoo will be awarded a hefty cash prize, a Range Rover, his or her choice of permanent habitat, and, if applicable, assisted migration courtesy of Continental Airlines. That is, of course, if the show manages to carry on to its conclusion. Originally set to premiere in September, The Zoo was delayed after the original camera crew was forced to flee. Reports of production problems have continued to surface since, including smashed cameras, urine-soaked sound equipment, and a boom-microphone windscreen that was stolen and raised as young.","entertainment, animals, tv, environment, television, news, vol 41 issue 46, entertainment"

3309,Metal Council Convenes To Discuss 'Metal Hand Sign' Abuse,"VATNAJÁEEKULL GLACIER, ICELAND'In an emergency session Tuesday, members of the Supreme Metal Council strongly condemned the increasing use of the metal hand sign in lay society, claiming that its meaning has become perverted by overuse. ""e metal sign, or 'sign of the goat,' has all but lost its impact as a token of respectful recognition for something truly 'rocking' or 'metal,'"" SMC president Terence ""Geezer"" Butler said. According to Butler, members are upset that their sacred gesture is being used to acknowledge and celebrate ""favorable but clearly non-metal events."" ""We have all heard the reports of people using it to greet their in-laws, or after starting their lawn mowers with a single pull,"" Butler said. ""But recently it was brought to our attention that someone used the gesture in a Texas convenience store after snagging the last box of carrot cakes. This simply won't do."" Formed in 1972 and comprising 12 of the most revered leaders of the metal community, the council meets annually in its majestic hall atop Vatnajökull, Iceland's largest glacier, to discuss metal affairs. The SMC convened for a special session after Nikki Sixx, Overlord Of Glam Metal Affairs, was sent hard photographic evidence of metal-sign abuse across the nation. Sixx's fellow high priests said they were ""shocked,"" calling it ""one of the most serious affronts to metal's integrity since the rise of rap-metal in the late 1990s."" ""I remember a time not long ago when the Devil Horns were reserved for only the most righteous of person, deed, or riff,"" Grand Elder Lemmy Kilmister said. ""To see someone throwing the horns to his mate at the launderette because the clothes dryer came to a full stop just as he finished reading his copy of CircusEE It breaks my heart.""odding in silent agreement were council members Adalwolfa, a curvaceous Frank Frazetta-drawn Teutonic she-warrior magically brought to life by the council, and the spirit of slain Pantera guitarist ""Dimebag"" Darrell Abbott. Compounding the problem, Sixx said, is the fact that many people who use the sign are not recognized members of the Metal Roster, the list of true metal acolytes engraved in medieval calligraphy on gleaming pages of steel. ""This man here, who invokes the sign merely to indicate his joy that his microwave popcorn is done: He is not metal,"" Sixx said. ""We have it on good authority that he prefers the music of Tim McGraw and that the magic word of 'Zoso' has never passed his lips."" The council discussed several harsh punishments to deter further metal-sign abuse. Paulo Pinto, bassist for the Brazilian thrash-metal band Sepultura and Overlord Of International Metal Affairs, suggested that the hand of a suspected signer should be immediately cut off. A contingency of death rockers from Gothenburg, Sweden recommended that any sign abuser, or anyone who is not sufficiently metal, should be forced to eat his severed hand while having his eyeballs burned with a superheated metal crucifix, and then be slowly skinned alive. More charitable members, such as former Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine, suggested that ""a helpful list of guidelines could educate others, allowing them to distinguish between metal and non-metal occurrences."" ""A lot of people who incorrectly make the sign have traces of metal in their hearts and minds, they just need the proper direction,"" Mustaine said. ""Remember that many are outcasts and losers. To punish them further is to destroy the future of metal."" Until the council decides what course of action to adopt, Butler said he believes that a simple rule of thumb will help reduce the incidence of metal-sign abuse. ""If your head is neither banging nor thrashing, you should not be throwing the sign,"" Butler said. ""It's that simple."" Yet, in a later interview in his private, skull-bedecked chambers, Butler expressed the concern that the problem has grown too widespread for even the mighty SMC to solve. He said he worries that metal standards have been on the decline for so long that few have any clear idea as to what is metal and what is not. The SMC has experienced deep ideological rifts in the past that have affected its ability to make strong decisions, most notably during the lengthy trial and eventual sentencing of Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich, who was indicted in 2004 on charges of cutting his hair, pussing out on Napster, and contributing to the original motion-picture soundtrack of Mission: Impossible 2. ""To this day, there are many on the council who deeply resent the presence of [Poison guitarist] C.C. DeVille,'"" Butler said. ""In fact, so do I. Despite our differences, the council still remains the sole arbitrator of all things metal. We must get through to those who wantonly abuse the sign of the goat. They must be informed that watering down the sign's meaning will result in serious consequences."" Should the abuse continue, Butler said the council ""will defer the matter to Satan.""""tt ","entertainment, music, culture, news, vol 41 issue 45, entertainment"

3311,I Plan To Take Full Advantage Of The Upcoming Q&A With Howie Mandel,"When I first heard that the DVD box set of Bobby's World was being released, I couldn't imagine more exciting news. Little did I know that, later that day, I would learn that the hilarious comedian who created the show, Howie Mandel, would be making a personal appearance at my local Sam Goody. And what's more, there was going to be a question-and-answer session. I knew I had to make a plan to maximize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It would be a privilege just to listen to Mr. Mandel speak in person, but to be able to openly address and benefit from the knowledge of the man whose voice graces both Gremlins movies? To tell you the truth, I am still not convinced that this so-called ""Q&A"" isn't one of the elaborate and sophisticated hidden-camera pranks Mr. Mandel is so fond of pulling and presenting on The Tonight Show. In the presence of a celebrity, there is an air around them that is electric. In such an atmosphere, it is very easy to lose your composure. After all, this is the voice of Gizmo we're talking about! If I flubbed the opportunity to ask him about his craft, I'd be kicking myself for the rest of my life. I already know what my first question is going to be. I'm going to ask whether he's okay with me addressing him as ""Howie."" Or if he would rather I call him ""Mr. Mandel."" Or even ""Howard."" Now I find myself wishing that I had written down the dozens, possibly hundreds of questions I've had for Mr. Mandel over the years. I can't blame myself, though. How was I supposed to know that I would one day be presented with the forum in which to ask them? Hindsight is 20/20, I suppose. Oh! I just remembered one! For my second question, I'm going to ask what it was like to portray the character of Dr. Wayne Fiscus in St. Elsewhere. Maybe I should also ask him if, as a comedian, it's hard to play dramedy. Something like, ""Mr. Mandel, I want to first thank you for coming today. It is a great honor to speak with you, sir. Secondly, you have done extensive dramedy work. I'm curious, do you see dramedy as an inhibition or as a refreshing change of pace?"" It might surprise you to learn that not everyone understands what a remarkable occasion this is. When I told Miriam that I had to cancel on our plans for Saturday, she nearly threw a fit. I tried to sit her down and explain why this was so important, but the more I said, the angrier she got. The sad thing is, it doesn't surprise me. Lately, we just seem to share less and less common ground. I wonder if it would be too demanding to request that Mr. Mandel answer my question in the voice of Bobby, his curious, hyperactive child character. I believe he would comply. Oh sure, he would probably have a sense of humor about that. Questions aside, there are more practical matters to plan. Like, there will probably be a few thousand people there, and to get a seat, I should plan to arrive well before the store opens. I should wear my orange sweater, too. That way, Mr. Mandel will have no trouble identifying me. He can simply say, ""You, there, in the orange."" As amazing as this opportunity is for a fan like me, I'm sure Mr. Mandel is looking forward to the Q&A as well. After all, this is a chance for him to get the truth out there at last. For example, I bet he'd be happy to settle the matter of his favorite Muppet Babies voice once and for all. Or to set the record straight about A Fine Mess. In fact, that's probably why he agreed to do the Q&A in the first place. One thing does worry me, however. That sign at Sam Goody said the Q&A would last only 15 minutes. That means I will have time for one, maybe two questions at the most. I may never learn the reason why Mr. Mandel chose to shave his head.","opinion, entertainment, celebrities, human interest, tv, commentary, vol 41 issue 44, lewis hodge, entertainment"

""You can't expect the cheap blue-screen to look good today, but man, what a steaming pile,"" said Richards, who has abandoned the idea of introducing his childhood favorite to his 7-year-old daughter Bailey. ""I can't believe how much they re-used that same shot of the same tyrannosaurus approaching Marshall, Will, and Holly's cave. And that Cha-Ka was such a bad Planet Of The Apes rip-off."" Richards still holds out hope that his as-yet unwatched Lidsville DVD set ""stays true"" to his memories.","entertainment, products, tv, news in brief, vol 41 issue 41, entertainment"

3318,"Citing Slow Summer Box Office, Hollywood Calls It Quits","BURBANK, CA'Universal Studios joined DreamWorks SKG, Sony Pictures, Warner Bros., Paramount, and Fox Monday, when CEO Ron Meyer announced that the company is shutting down operations and ceasing all film production, effective immediately. ""In their hearts, every studio chair would like to be a patron of the arts,"" said a candid and reflective Meyer, speaking from his New York office on the 69th floor of Manhattan's Rockefeller Plaza. ""But this is a business, not an artists' charity ward."" According to Hollywood insiders, summer 2005 dealt the death blow to an already ailing industry. With box-office receipts 9 percent lower than those of 2004, the few successes, such as The 40-Year-Old Virgin and War Of The Worlds, could not carry the industry. Regarding the decision to liquidate Paramount, Viacom CEO Sumner Redstone said, ""It was a simple choice: cling to an outdated business model or cut the pictures loose."" To better protect their stockholders' interests, Hollywood will be shifting its focus to safer, more reliable profit models, including real estate, life insurance, and the sale of hygiene products. Said Meyer: ""The mortuary industry also seems like a good bet. No matter what happens in the economy, there's always a market for funeral homes. People are always dying. That doesn't go unpredictably out of fashion with the public's taste, like, say, historical costume epics or Russell Crowe."" Monday, construction crews quietly dismantled the storied Hollywood Walk of Fame. ""This is a real shame,"" said foreman Kevin McKnight, directing members of his crew to pry the brass stars from Hollywood Boulevard and transfer them to a nearby freight crate destined for a Japanese smelting plant. ""I love movies. My whole family does. All my life, I loved movies."" With each studio's decision to cease operations, dozens of films in various stages of production will quietly die, some going to DVD, others disappearing entirely, amounting to little more than tax write-offs. Assets are being sold for pennies on the dollar, and hastily liquidated prop houses and set rooms have flooded an already deluged eBay resale market. An original Indiana Jones flight jacket was sold Tuesday for $1.49 plus shipping. Figures from the California Labor Department reflect the industry's sudden collapse. As of Tuesday, some 700 directors, 15,000 producers, 2,900 entertainment lawyers, 14,000 writers, and 72,000 actors'not to mention countless gaffers, tour guides, production designers, publicists, souvenir sellers, and personal assistants'were reportedly out of work. ""I feel a little betrayed,"" said Stealth director Rob Cohen. ""After the summer season ended, I had hoped that people would start coming back to theaters, or maybe the industry would cook up some new concepts."" Cohen added: ""Now it looks like I'll have to go back to directing TV ads."" ""I don't know how my family will get by without a steady source of income,"" said 43-year-old Los Angeles resident Kirk Ferguson, a third-generation set carpenter. ""Making facades that get blown up is all I know."" The absence of films is creating a ripple effect far beyond Southern California. Movie ushering has become an obsolete trade overnight, as first-run theaters shut down, convert to loft apartment space, and force hundreds of thousands of adolescents into the already crowded lawn-mowing and car-washing professions. ""A lot of movie history was made on the Warner Bros. lot, but not a lot of money,"" Warner Bros. CEO Barry Meyer said. ""We've been sitting on valuable land at the height of a booming real-estate market. We could have sold it off months ago instead of making Must Love Dogs. We acted irresponsibly, and for this I apologize to our stockholders."" With little hope of getting a job in Hollywood, ex-film-industry employees are understandably reacting with anger and despair. Some, however, are more philosophical. ""I can always go back to Wisconsin and tend bar,"" actor Mark Ruffalo said. ""Maybe do some community theater. The folks you should really feel sorry for are Jack Nicholson and Tom Cruise. They're fucking nuts. I have no idea what they'll do without Hollywood."" The void is not likely to remain for long, with heavy hitters such as Bollywood producer Aamir Khan ready to swoop in. ""We are very excited to be entering the American entertainment market,"" Khan said. ""Our first release, timed to coincide with the American holiday entertainment rush, is a remake of Mahabharata, a five-hour retelling of the ancient Hindu epic, filled with thrilling synchronized dance numbers and much romance.""","entertainment, business, economy, movies, 50 states, news, vol 41 issue 40, entertainment"

""But now, even the most sheltered, derivative Delta blues musician should have enough material to cut an album.""

3320,"Two Publicists, Stylist, Personal Assistant Injured As Nicole Kidman Turns On Handlers","LOS ANGELES'An attack by Oscar-winner Nicole Kidman Monday left four handlers injured and two in intensive care, where they are listed in serious but stable condition. The attack, which occurred during a photo shoot for Premiere magazine at the landmark Chateau Marmont in Hollywood, serves as a reminder that, despite their beautiful appearance, celebrities are both dangerous and unpredictable. ""Even experienced handlers can't turn their backs on these creatures,"" said celebrity behaviorist Laurel Fraser, who has conducted extensive field studies on such performers as Madonna, Bruce Willis, and an entire pride of Baldwins. ""It's easy for people in the starkeeping profession to get complacent, and when stars sense that, they often lash out."" Stylist Melody Cosgrove was rushed to West Hills Hospital with broken bones, severe blood loss, and deep lacerations to the face, neck, and shoulders, likely inflicted by Kidman's cherry-red, two-inch talons. Personal assistant Barrie Levesque reportedly suffered extensive nerve damage, as well as severely yanked hair. Publicists Kiki Landresky and Martin O'Reilly have been released from West Hills after being treated for cuts and minor contusions. O'Reilly received a puncture wound to the thigh from one of Kidman's stiletto heels. Celebrity-control officers working with the LAPD cornered the actress outside a sound stage at Hollywood Center Studios late Tuesday and shot her with a tranquilizer dart after failing to coax her into custody with an expensive gift bag. ""She was just calmly feeding at a craft-services table, unaware of all the havoc she raised,"" celebrity-control officer Rene Bofill said. ""After being tranquilized, she began to snort and rave, knocking down tables and chairs before she collapsed near the set of That's So Raven."" As with many celebrity attacks, the victims reported that Kidman gave no warning before striking. ""She's been made up millions of times'I don't know why on this particular occasion she exploded,"" O'Reilly said. ""It was pretty scary. She just coiled up in her makeup chair and pounced on the stylist."" After overpowering Cosgrove, Kidman turned on longtime assistant Levesque, beating him with her powerful, flapping arms, the span of which is reportedly six feet. '[Levesque] is lucky he wasn't killed,' Fraser said. 'Nicole's long, sinewy legs contain enough power to decapitate an adult human.' Former personal assistant Kari Lynn Hable, who was hospitalized with compound leg fractures in 1999 following a violent encounter with actor Chris O'Donnell, said ""there is no such thing as a tame star."" ""Sometimes, we love our celebrities so much that we want them to experience the same freedoms we enjoy,"" Hable said. ""But if something goes wrong, you'll quickly realize that a lot separates a celebrity from an ordinary human being. And believe me, you never, ever want to find yourself in the powerful jaws of a Chris O'Donnell."" The Kidman attack has raised questions about what motivates some individuals to handle and maintain such volatile creatures. ""The thing is, they're so gorgeous and exotic, it's like having a little piece of glamour with you at all times,"" Fraser said. ""I'm not advocating irresponsible handling of celebrities. I've heard of some celebrity managers keeping two or three celebrities in their offices at one time. That's just cruel. You have to respect their space."" Kidman is currently in captivity in a Brentwood celebrity preserve while authorities debate whether she should be destroyed.","entertainment, celebrities, animals, jobs, news, vol 41 issue 39, entertainment"

""Mötley Crüe is now contractually obligated to fondle, pinch, and comment lewdly on everyone they encounter during their six-month, 12-nation gig.

3324,Oprah Stuns Audience With Free Man Giveaway,"CHICAGO'The season premiere of The Oprah Winfrey Show unleashed a surprise for viewers Monday, when host Winfrey presented her studio audience with an unexpected gift: eligible men. ""Everybody gets a man! Everybody gets a man!"" said Winfrey, almost drowned out by cries of disbelief as 276 men, one for every member of the studio audience, filed onto the Oprah set. Hoping to top last year's season-debut surprise, when members of the studio audience received free cars, Winfrey watched elated as the men knelt before their awestruck new mates and delivered gallant kisses and professions of undying affection. ""Signed, sealed, deliveredEE they're yours!""infrey said. Hand-picked by Winfrey and her staff, the men range in age from 29 to 63 and were described by assistant producer Sally Heffernan-Ross as ""great catches"" with semi-professional to professional careers and stable personalities. ""Oprah showed it can happen: You can get that man of your dreams, or at least of your minimal expectations,"" Heffernan-Ross said. The men, dressed in fresh chinos and polo shirts and bearing single red roses and gift baskets from Bath & Body Works, emerged moments after audience members were instructed to reach beneath their chairs, where they found inlaid boxes containing keys. The keys, Winfrey explained, unlocked the doors to the men's individual domiciles. ""He's yours! He's completely yours!"" Winfrey said to one speechless young woman who appeared stunned by what was going on around her. Assuring ""no months of awkward dating"" or ""questions over who's going to make the first move,"" Winfrey said her man giveaway had totally eliminated the guesswork of romance. The men Winfrey gave away are guaranteed to enjoy snuggling, to find the few extra pounds gained over time ""cute,"" and to have read at least three books by the poet Maya Angelou. ""Oh, I love Maya,"" said one of the giveaway men, 32-year-old electrical engineer Doug Jefferson, who also enjoys warm, comfy sweaters. ""I think she's very brave. Heck, I love poetry in general. Who doesn't?"" Winfrey had to reassure several of the more timid studio-audience members. ""Don't worry, ladies, they won't be going anywhere,"" Winfrey said. ""Kiss him! Give his behind a little squeeze! It's okay'he's your man!"" [pagebreak] As with 2004's Pontiac G6 giveaway, the man giveaway came as a complete surprise to audience members, many of whom said the men arrived just in time. ""I was beginning to think it was never, ever going to happen,"" said Karla Drozdowicz, 34, an unmarried bank teller from Superior, WI who won radio-sales executive Chris Iredell. ""I'm totally thrilled to get Chris. He's not what I imagined from my romance stories, but I'll love him just the same."" Another audience member, Gwendolyn Havers, said her years of watching Oprah instead of dating had ""finally paid off."" ""My mom says my 'wallflower' personality keeps me from meeting men,"" Havers said. ""Well, if I wasn't such an Oprah fan, I wouldn't have gotten tickets to her show, and I wouldn't have won [part-time assistant tech-support manager] Eric [Fitzgerald]."" Heffernan-Ross said the audience members were selected from a pool of ""hundreds of thousands of single, lonely women"" who had put in requests for show tickets. ""Unlike the selection process for the men, finding unattached women was very easy,"" Heffernan-Ross said. ""All we had to do was stick our hands in a big barrel of letters, and voilá, our perfect audience."" Harpo Productions, Winfrey's production company, assured the winners that their prizes are guaranteed to ""be into [them]"" through 2010, and agreed to pay all local and state taxes relating to the men, as well. However, federal income tax and expenses such as meals, movie tickets, motel stays, teddy bears, plush slippers, and commitment rings will not be covered. Audience member Karen Schoenegge, 38, who was awarded 41-year-old collections-department supervisor John Zimmerman, said several drawbacks have emerged since the show's taping. ""Well, as soon as we got back to the hotel, I found out that John doesn't give backrubs,"" Schoenegge said. ""He's also weird about me walking in the bathroom to pee while he's in the shower. I mean, it's not like I'm looking at him. He needs to loosen up a little. But I shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth. I really, really needed a new man."" The seven audience members who declined their men, saying that they were too insecure about their weight to feel confident in a romantic relationship, were instead treated to all-expenses-paid weekends at the Omni Hotel in downtown Chicago..o","entertainment, tv, gender, news, vol 43 issue 19, entertainment"

3328,Food Critic Tears Radish Canapés With Salmon Mousse A New Asshole,"MANCHESTER, NH'An appetizer of radish canapés with salmon mousse served at local French restaurant La Maison de Vin was torn a new asshole this week, according to Concord Monitor food critic Bernard Haberle, who reviewed the establishment in his ""Good Eating"" column. ""I ripped those canapés a hole so wide they'll be shitting blood for days,"" said Haberle, who singled out the dish in his review, calling it ""a misguided fusion of land and sea."" ""The mousse alone got a reaming that will have it crying for its mama,"" he added. The hors d'oeuvres, presented on a bed of arugula topped with a salmon mousse of blended shallots, green onions, and white wine, were ""force-fed their own balls"" by Haberle, who in his column described the menu item as ""a modest offering that should have aspired for more."" ""I beat the living fuck out of that dish,"" said Haberle, whose column has over the last 15 years become a staple in the Concord Monitor ""Lifestyles And Culture"" section. ""If that appetizer knows what's good for it, it'll get on its knees and pray for mercy from sweet baby Jesus, because I went John Wayne Gacy on that shit,"" Haberle said. ""Those canapés are probably wishing they had a dollop of crème fraîche to hide behind."" Haberle said that he takes a broad array of factors into account'including quality and freshness of ingredients, attention to detail, and price'before deciding whether or not a particular course deserves to be ""bent backwards over a toilet and skull-fucked."" ""Did you read the part where I say the canapés' 'pedestrian plating falls somewhere between gauche and maladroit'? Take that, sub-par appetizer."" Haberle hastened to add that, although he is a discriminating critic, he more often than not gives positive reviews. ""I have no problem with slobbing the knob of a Gorgonzola-stuffed prawn if I feel it's earned. Just last week, I had a roasted striped bass in an almond-chanterelle crust with caramelized cipollini onions that was so divine I'd piss-gargle its sweaty balls in an abortion-clinic dumpster if that's what it was into."" When asked if he will return to La Maison de Vin to give the canapés a ""second go-round,"" Haberle responded, ""I kick-fucked that bitch, and I think it's best I leave it to rot in the ditch where I left it."" Members of the community have defended Haberle's review, saying his column has proven indispensable when selecting restaurants. ""Sure, he's being a little hard on the dish,"" said Sue Wellington, 42, who regularly dines out with her husband, Chuck. ""But if Mr. Haberle drowns a plate of sesame-marinated cuttlefish in hot, infected jets of his pus-curdled cum, Chuck and I know to stay away from it.""","entertainment, food, culture, news media, news, vol 41 issue 36, entertainment"

3333,Dave Matthews Not That Into Himself Anymore,"CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA'Dave Matthews, the 38-year-old singer and guitarist for the multi-platinum group The Dave Matthews Band, announced Tuesday that he is no longer into himself. ""I used to be a hardcore Dave Matthews fan,"" said Matthews on the porch of his Virginia home. ""I had all my records and posters. I was so blown away by everything I did'especially my live performances. I remember me and my buddies used to drive for hours just to go to one of our shows."" Matthews, who formed the Dave Matthews Band in 1991, is perhaps best known for the hit songs ""Crash Into Me"" and ""The Space Between."" ""Me and my band are still okay, but I feel like I've grown out of us,"" Matthews said. ""Back when I was in the college charts, we were about all I listened to, but I guess I'm at the point in my life where my music just doesn't speak to me."" Matthews admitted that most of his current Dave Matthews listening is confined to overhearing a hit single on a jukebox or PA system. However, while doing dishes last weekend, he tried listening to 1998's Before These Crowded Streets, an album he had not heard in over two years. The singer admitted that by the fourth track, he was barely even listening. ""It sounded like this sort of worldbeat background drone,"" Matthews said. ""So I took it off and put on some Stevie Ray Vaughan instead."" ""Rock music with a violin? I don't know,"" Matthews added. ""Seemed cool once."" Although Matthews continues to attend every single performance of his band, and even his own solo appearances, he claims it's ""more out of obligation"" than out of passion for his music. Matthews said that while he once felt exhilarated whenever his group launched into one of their famous prolonged jam sessions, he can now ""barely sit through them."" Said Matthews: ""Lately, I try to vary my routine so I don't get bored on stage. Usually, if there's a long solo, I'll go get a beer or check out the T-shirts."" Matthews even feels isolated from fans with whom he once felt a strong bond, disparaging them as ""lame."" He also admits that the older he gets, the more out of place he feels around ""kids in their Dave Matthews phase."" ""I used to talk for hours about my music or spend a whole night in a DMB chatroom,"" Matthews said. ""But now, the people at the shows seem like such geeks, standing there with their elaborate taping equipment. They're really, really young, too. What do I have in common with them? They're just a bunch of kids who need someone to look up to. Why would I look up to me? I'm so 1997."" Yet for all his disenchantment with the Dave Matthews Band, he'll still ""probably check me out at Farm Aid in September."" Added Matthews: ""If I'm even playing there this year. I don't even know. Dave Matthews'that is to say, me'just isn't where I'm coming from anymore.""","entertainment, celebrities, music, summer music, news, vol 41 issue 34, entertainment"
3334,What Has Our Society Come To When March Of The Penguins Is The Blockbuster Hit Of The Summer?,"I've been a major Hollywood director for a long time, and I thought I'd seen it all. But I can't help wondering what's happening to the entertainment industry'indeed, to our entire society. Where are our standards? Our values? For fuck's sake'our cultural priorities? I simply cannot accept that March Of The Penguins is the big summer hit everybody's talking about. Hello? It used to be that a summer blockbuster had to have brutal violence, sexy women, breathtaking action sequences, adrenaline-pumping high-speed chases'at a bare minimum, some explosions. But sitting through that penguin movie, I couldn't believe my eyes. Where were the big set pieces? Hell, this movie didn't even have sets! Has anyone ever heard of production values? It's one of the most vital aspects of the filmmaking art, and you don't get it by just showing up on an iceberg and filming whatever happens to be in front of you. Frankly, for real icebergs, they looked fake. This film is an insult to the great men and women who spend countless hours in front of computers creating incredibly realistic CGI icebergs. Does no one out there care about these things anymore but me? Am I a lone voice of sanity crying out in a universe gone mad? What kind of a world do we live in when a futuristic techno-thriller starring Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson as escaped clones on levitating jet bikes doesn't outgross the shit out of a glorified Discovery Channel rerun? Don't people realize how much money I spent? How many people it took to bring that vision to the screen? Do people realize how many rewrites and punch-ups we went through? I paid my writers millions of dollars, and they were some of the best in the biz. You know who wrote their script? A bunch of birds. Where was the villain? A story's not going to keep an audience on the edge of their seats without a strong opposition. Where was the second-act turning point? You've gotta have that moment when the hero's at the end of his rope and the bad guy looks like he's going to win it all. And where was the love story? Stars have to have real chemistry that smolders on the screen to make a summer blockbuster one to remember. Okay, the penguin movie had mating cycles, but that's not love. Is it all about sex to these animals? Speaking of which, I think we can all agree that the penguins in this film gave some pretty wooden performances. In many scenes, it was impossible to tell them apart. Maybe if they'd moved the camera once in a while, I could have gotten more emotionally invested in what was going on. For Christ's sake, there was not a single crane shot in the whole movie! I remember a day when the public appreciated fine cinema. In that lost age, it made sense that my important historical drama Pearl Harbor had a fighting chance for at least a special-effects Oscar. Best sound, no question. But now, in this crazy upside-down, topsy-turvy world, I hear that'guess what?'the only summer movie getting any Oscar buzz is a static, near-silent documentary about waddling, flightless birds! These days, I guess old-fashioned values like ""megawattage,"" ""high-octane thrill rides,"" and ""explosions"" just don't matter anymore. Well, I call that a sad day for American moviemaking. I'm busy in pre-production planning my next big spectacle (which no one will see because they'll be off watching a 10-hour documentary on park squirrels, no doubt). But if you are in the San Diego area, do me this favor: Go to Sea World, walk into the emperor-penguin exhibit, and punch one those fuckers right in the face.

""You can't control him, but you have to at least steer him in the right direction. That's how you handle a star of his caliber."" According to Matherson, Cruise's ""PR nightmare"" began with an article in the German publication Der Spiegel, which reported that Cruise arranged to have a tent for the Church of Scientology set up on the set of War Of The Worlds. ""I have no idea what he was thinking, promoting Scientology when he's supposed to be shooting a film,"" said Matherson, who was on a movie set only once, when he took the Universal Studios tour in 1988. Matherson added: ""I would have redirected the questioning the moment the reporter started asking Tom about religion, or maybe just said, 'Okay, let's wrap this up.'"" Although not a regular reader of Der Spiegel, Matherson said he gleaned information about the publication from the celebrity-news program Insider, which he typically watches alone in his room while eating cold cereal. Matherson cited Cruise's May 23 appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show as the first sign the popular actor was in need of some guidance. ""Even with a guy like Tom Cruise, who makes $20 million a movie, you've got to lay down the law,"" said Matherson, who is not in a supervisory position in the financial-aid office. ""I would have told him, 'Lay off the poetry. Stick with the smile. The smile is working for you.'"" Matherson said he has some ideas for keeping Cruise ""on message."" ""I would want to work out a hand-signal system with Tom, so I could motion to him from backstage when he was getting out of control,"" Matherson said. Matherson's friends and coworkers report that the file clerk often makes comments drawing on his knowledge of the celebrity world, which he monitors from this ensconced position in the center of America's cattle-producing heartland. ""Back when Britney Spears wed and divorced her childhood friend all within a 24-hour period, Ben used to lean over the countertop at the office and shake his head,"" said Shelly Johansen, who has worked as a file clerk in the financial-aid office since 1992. ""He thought it was a really bad move for her."" Cruise is currently in Italy shooting Mission Impossible 3 and out of the public eye, which Matherson believes is ""for the best."" ""I don't know if Tom realizes what a headache he can be for a PR man,"" Matherson said, repeating comments he made earlier in the day to coworker Gary Siebold. ""A good image buffing isn't gonna do the trick at this point. We need to talk damage control."" The lifelong Nebraska resident's recommendations for Cruise include pulling him off the interview circuit for ""dehydration and exhaustion,"" then spending a day or two ""giving him some talking points."" Jessica Furstrom, a receptionist from nearby Lincoln and a longtime armchair publicist for Courtney Love, said Matherson ""has a long row to hoe"" with Cruise. ""I went through a lot of this same type of thing with Courtney,"" Furstrom said. ""These problems don't just go away by themselves. The hard work of repairing a star's image has to get done. And thank God there are publicists to do it.""","entertainment, celebrities, advertising, news, vol 41 issue 30, entertainment"
3342,Never In My Wildest Dreams Did I Think I'd Get Bored Watching Robots Fight,"Who doesn't love robots? They're scary, they're powerful, and they're intelligent. They're frickin' cool, is the long and short of it. And robots fighting?! That's off the charts, as they say. Or so I thought. Lo and behold, last night, as I was watching the Eviscerator's rusty-steel jaws demolish Dr. Clomp's titanium shell on Battlebots, I dozed off. Roy F. Mason? Dozing off during a flurry of sparks and shrieking metal as robots used their mechanized strength to pulverize each other? What's wrong with this picture? Could I be the same person who once came to blows with Steve Olsen during a late-night debate over who'd triumph in a battle between Tornado and Gort? (My position, of course: Gort in a walk.) Well, I can only say that I saw a 30-pound, two-part robot armed with only a circular saw stave off relentless attacks from a pit of MIT AI robots and it left me cold. Some things cannot be explained. If you had told me when I was 8 years old that there would one day be TV shows featuring nothing but robots fighting each other, I probably would have flipped out. I would have counted down the days to that glorious, unimaginable future. But now, watching those little toaster ovens roll around and bump into each other just makes me want to change the channel. When I first heard about Battlebots and Robot Wars, I was ecstatic. I stayed up all night for weeks imagining my own attack robot, ""The Cybernihilator."" He had whirling tentacles with electrodes and spot welders on alternating ends, giving him the ability to short-circuit robot opponents and weld them to the floor. But now, the sight of dueling robots'not fake cartoon robots, not guys in robot costumes, but actual robots in an actual Robot War!'makes me sleepy. Maybe the producers of these shows are at fault. I mean, how about giving these robots a little personality? You can't just slap a remote device on a lawn mower and call it a robot. Give it a synthesized voice, something deep and sinister. A woman's voice might be a nice touch, too. Add some motorized eyes, or make them sexy, like in I, RobotEE Aw, will you listen to me? What am I saying? I'm talking about an arena battle of figh""g robots, for Pete's sake. Who am I to look that kind of gift horse in the mouth? How about this: Let's eliminate the featherweight-bots category. I'm sorry, but watching a slightly modified dustbuster fight for its existence is about as interesting as a walk in the park. How about pitting two mechanized tanks against each other for a change?! It would be like ""MrooooooooW! Pow pow pow! Ker-BLOOM!"" Also, maybe it's that these contests lack a human element. No humans are ever in danger. How about upping the ante for the robot teams, maybe strap the programmers' infant children onto the robots so each battle has some real stakes? Now, that's a Robot War! In fact, why are thesel","opinion, entertainment, human interest, technology, tv, commentary, vol 45 issue 01, roy f. mason, entertainment"
3343,E! Gives Local Masturbator Inside Scoop On This Summer's Hottest New Swimwear,"CLARKSVILLE, IN'Gregg Reinisch, a Clarksville-area masturbator, stays on top of all the latest trends in swimwear by watching the E! cable network, it was reported Tuesday. ""When I want the inside scoop on which swimsuit styles are heating up the beaches this summer, there's only one network I turn to,"" Reinisch said of E!, whose award-winning swimwear coverage includes such programs as Fashion File: Sexy Swimsuits, Special Report: Beachwear '98 and An E! History Of The Bikini. ""E! is the only channel that offers the kind of in-depth information I crave."" According to the 26-year-old masturbator, without E! he would not know what suits to look out for on the beaches of St. Tropez and Rio de Janeiro, where less is definitely more. ""About five or six years ago, before I started watching E!, I took a trip to the south of France,"" Reinisch said. ""It was awful'there were swimsuits all around me, but I didn't have the slightest idea which ones were the hot new styles to keep an eye on. I was an uninformed beachgoer, and that's the worst kind."" Barry Booker, E! vice-president of programming, said his network strives to be the leader in the field of swimwear coverage. ""Why is our coverage the best? Because we don't just tell the viewer what changes they can expect in swimsuit styles, we show them,"" Booker said. ""For example, if pink is the hot color for bikinis this year, we make sure to actually show what a pink bikini looks like on a tight-bodied 20-year-old down on all fours in the surf. Or if, for example, floral prints are in, we make sure to show what a floral-printed bikini looks like on a tight-bodied 20-year-old down on all fours in the surf. Our viewers appreciate that."" ""There is an amazing variety of swimsuits we can lovingly pan over while a model arches her back on a rock,"" Booker said. ""From the French-cut one-piece to the Brazilian-style bikini, to the traditional G-string, there are nearly as many swimsuits as there are masturbators."" While swimsuit fashion captivates Reinisch, it is by no means his only area of interest. ""Lately, I've been reading a lot of books about Miami Dolphins cheerleading-squad calendars and how they're put together'how the photos are taken, what's going through a particular cheerleader's mind as the photos are being taken. It's really a fascinating process,"" Reinisch said. ""So you can imagine how thrilled I was to find out that E! will soon air a half-hour documentary on this very subject. Apparently, when the Dolphins cheerleaders went to Jamaica to shoot their 1999 swimsuit calendar, an E! reporter and camera crew tagged along to get the inside scoop on the whole thing. It sounds incredible. I'm masturbating just thinking about it.""","entertainment, human interest, sex, tv, news, vol 41 issue 28, entertainment"

3346,"This Script Practically Writes, Directs, And Universally Pans Itself","Find yourself a chair, guys, 'cause I've got exactly what we've been looking for: an idea so formulaic, any screenwriting hack could knock it out with his eyes closed. A film so predictable, we could produce it with our Blackberries turned off. Everybody who sees it, critics and audiences alike, will be guaranteed to hate it. Is everybody on this conference call sitting down? Here we go: Van Helsing Reborn! I'm telling you, this script will practically write, direct, and universally pan itself! Van Helsing Reborn! Picture that title on the cover page of a screenplay. Now, see it up on the marquee at Mann's Chinese Theater. Now imagine it next to one star in every newspaper in America. It's a natural! I know Van Helsing didn't die at the end of the first movie! You're thinking too small. Hell, the total lack of continuity is what will make this baby so easy for some schmuck in San Diego to write, a recent NYU grad to shoot, someone's cousin to edit, and the masses to mock! In the first one, Van Helsing went up against who again? The Wolfman, Frankenstein, and Dracula? Okay, so we have a perfect opportunity to exploit some old movie-monster properties! Slap in a couple, and the picture's half done. Think about it: Van Helsing meets the Invisible Man, the Bride of Frankenstein, and the Creature from the Black Lagoon. Why come up with new monsters? People love the classics! That Black Lagoon thing would be perfect for bringing in the black audience. Okay, so he's green, but I think I've hit on something. We could black him up a little, put some gold chains on him, and make him talk all street. We'll blanket the inner-city neighborhoods with an aggressive billboard campaign, bring in the urban audience in droves, and be criticized by the NAACP as an example of what's wrong with the entertainment industry today! I'm telling you, people all over the country will despise this movie like a freakin' sickness! The word of mouth will be absolutely terrible! Okay, I know what you're thinking: There's more to making movies than displeasing the masses. Don't you worry. Every media outlet from The New Yorker on down to Access Hollywood will hate this piece of shit. Van Helsing's an immortal or something, right? I can't remember why'isn't he half-vampire or something? Or am I thinking of Wesley Snipes? Aw, hell, it doesn't matter. Anyway, since he lives forever, we could set it in any time period we want. He blasts ancient Indian mummies in the Old West. Or we could turn the Headless Horseman into some kind of haunted cowboy, and toss him into the mix. Or he could fight Nazi zombies in World War II, or that monster from They Saved Hitler's Brain. Your silence tells me you have some doubts. Why don't we come up with a decent story? What if we find a talented director? What if we made a movie with some artistic merit? Well, we're never going to find out, because we're going to crank this dung heap out, pocket the opening-weekend grosses, and start on an even shittier movie before the inevitable 78-percent audience dropoff in week two. Wait! I just got an idea. We set the whole movie right here in the present. Van Helsing gets a job working for the CIA'in, like, the Special Monster Tactics Division or something. He fights Freddy, Jason, and Chucky! And the bride and seed of Chucky, too, while we're at it! Think of the toys! With a big enough budget and the right release date, we can't lose. It'll be the most unwatchable summer blockbuster yet! So, you guys on board? Say the word and I can have legal fax you the contracts by 3:00.

3354,Actual Expert Too Boring For TV,"SECAUCUS, NJ'Dr. Gary Canton, a professor of applied nuclear physics and energy-development technologies at MIT and a leading expert in American nuclear-power applications, was rejected by MSNBC producers for being ""too boring for TV"" Monday. ""We could deal with Dr. Canton being so short,"" said Cal Salters, a segment producer at MSNBC. ""And we could've made him up so he didn't look like he spends all day in front of a computer. We even considered cutting away to stock footage so our audience didn't have to look at him for too long. But when it turned out that listening to him is about as interesting as picking the lint off his lapels'well, there was nothing we could do about that."" Canton was brought in for a test interview based on a recent op-ed in the Boston Globe, in which he argued that increased reliance on nuclear power is ""inevitable."" When asked to address nuclear power's potentially disastrous consequences, however, Canton launched into a well-reasoned lecture that balanced modern energy demands against safety and environmental concerns. ""At MIT's Laboratory for Energy and the Environment, we see nuclear-power technology as the best option for the United States and the world to meet future energy needs without emitting carbon dioxide and other atmospheric pollutants,"" Canton said in the taped pre-interview, which has already been erased. ""Other energy options include increased efficiency, renewables, and carbon sequestration. Actually, all of these options may be needed for a successful, non-stratified, growth-oriented national energy infrastructure."" Salters was not impressed. ""[Canton] went on like that for sixEE longEE minutes,""ters said. ""Fact after mind-numbing fact. Then he started spewing all these statistics about megawatts and the nation's current energy consumption and I don't know what, because my mind just shut off. I tried to lead him in the right direction. I told him to address the fears that the average citizen might have about nuclear power, but he still utterly failed to mention meltdowns, radiation, or mushroom clouds."" ""I'm sure he knows what he's talking about,"" Salters added. ""But we have a responsibility to educate and entertain our viewers. In the end, we had to go with someone else."" MSNBC chose Skip Hammond, former Arizona State football player, MBA holder, and author of Imprison The Sun: America's Coming Nuclear-Power Holocaust. Hammond is best known for his ""atomic domino"" theory of chained power-plant explosions and his signature lavender silk tie. ""Absolute Armageddon,"" Hammond said when asked about the dangers increased reliance on nuclear power might pose. ""Atoms are not only too tiny to be seen, they're too powerful to be predicted. Three Mile Island? Remember it? I do. Don't they?"" ""Clouds of radiation, glowing rivers, a hole reaching to the earth's core'that's what we're facing, "" Hammond continued. ""Death of one in four Americans! Count off, everyone: one, two, three, you. Millions of people gone. And no one's even mentioned terrorism yet. You have to wonder why not."" According to Salters, Hammond was ""perfect."" ""The way Skip looked right into that camera and said 'annihilation' with perfect enunciation'I've been in the news business for 14 years, and I still got goose bumps,"" Salters said. Reached at his office, Canton said he was unsure why he wasn't chosen for the program. ""I discussed the interrelated technical, economic, environmental, and political challenges associated with increased nuclear-power usage over the next half-century and their relevance to government, industry, and community leaders,"" Canton said. ""You'd think it would be exactly what they wanted. It was exactly what they wanted, according to the producer who contacted me."" Hammond is scheduled to appear in all six parts of the upcoming Learning Channel series Frost Or Fire: America's Coming Energy Tribulations..oos","entertainment, tv, media, news, vol 41 issue 18, entertainment"
3355,I Can't Stand It When Jews Talk During Movies,"Do you have a pet peeve'some little thing that drives you completely bonkers? For certain people, it's the sound of a Jewish person dragging her fingernails across a chalkboard. For others, it's when Jews don't signal before making a turn. Me? I can't stand it when Jews talk during movies! Last Friday, I knocked off early from work and headed to the multiplex to catch The Pacifier. Sure enough, as soon as the lights go out, a pack of Jews waltzes in and plunks down right in front of me! All through the first preview, they had to have a Jewish debate about where to put their coats and who should hold the Twizzlers. What's wrong with these idiots? If you want to chat, go to a coffee shop, or that Jewish community center down on Cavendish Avenue. Where did these people learn to whisper? An Israeli helicopter? I sure didn't pay $10 to listen to a group of twits talk back to the screen like those obnoxious Jewish robots from Mystery Science Theater 3000! And apparently, ""God's chosen people"" weren't selected based on their ability to follow plotlines. No wonder they wandered the desert for so many years'they can't even watch a Vin Diesel movie without getting lost. It would help if management took stronger action against this total lack of regard. A sign saying, ""Jews: Kindly refrain from talking during the film"" couldn't hurt. I don't think I'm being unreasonable here. That theater was as loud as an Elders of Zion meeting. Is it asking too much to expect a little courtesy from your fellow moviegoers? I guess some people just weren't raised gentile. Look, I enjoy eating popcorn while taking in a flick, but at least I have the presence of mind to keep my munching to a conscientious level. Sometimes it feels like I'm the only one who wasn't raised in a barn where special precautions are taken to slaughter livestock in accordance with Jewish laws and traditions. If you can keep kosher, why can't you keep quiet? And how many times can these descendants of Abraham possibly need to use the washroom? If you have to go that often, sit near an aisle and leave the middle seats for those of us who aren't circumcised. You guys may not believe in the doctrine of original sin, but everyone agrees that failing to turn off your cell phone before the movie starts is just plain rude! I swear, the next time a phone goes off, someone's getting a yarmulke shoved down his throat. If there were some other way to see movies, I'd do it. I've tried renting movies, only to have the film interrupted midway through by a Jewish telemarketer or the sounds of the Jews upstairs blasting their rap music. I can only imagine what that guy with the fiddler on his roof went through. It's the Jewish year 5766, for cripes sake!

I'm no exception. As I sit here in my chateau in France, absent-mindedly flipping through the script for The Diving Bell And The Butterfly by Oscar-winning screenwriter Ronald Harwood, I think of the man I used to be, and my heart sinks. I know I shouldn't let thoughts of the past get me down. Rather, I should overcome my insecurities and remind myself that there could be an even bigger success around the corner. Why, you never know what you can achieve if you just believe in yourself andEE Aw, hell. Who'm I kidding here? I'll never top 21 Jump Street and I know it. I've tried, honestly I have. I've picked roles carefully and gone out of my way to work with unique and talented collaborators, regardless of their level of commercial success. I've done my best to go the extra mile: wearing pancake makeup and scissor-hand prosthetics, sporting fake gold teeth and channeling Keith Richards, even having my friggin' head shaved to play Hunter S. Thompson."" can honestly say I've committed myself to every part with all I've had. But, let's face it: Those characters on Jump Street shared a special camaraderie as they went undercover to solve mysteries in Southern California high schools. An actor just doesn't find that sense of belonging and purpose while working with Jim Jarmusch. Ah, the heady early years of the Fox network. The executives were hung"", motivated, and willing to try anything. A young Stephen J. Cannell, 21 Jump Street's creator, had the world on a string. My future seemed assured as well, but little did I know how disappointing it would prove to be. Cannell went on to produce Booker, Silk Stalkings, and The Commish, and where did I end up? Aimlessly wandering from one project to another and sitting around the Viper Room with a ""Wino Forever"" tattoo. I've kept my career afloat. I've been blessed with more lucky breaks than most guys my age, I'll admit. But I know what everybody's thinking: ""What a sad little man. Depp's just going through the motions. Can't he see that Tom Hanson was the role of a lifetime and it's all been downhill since?"" As I walk past the paparazzi, I can hear their thoughts: ""Give it up, old man! You're almost 42. You're a fossil!"" Pathetic. I'll bet John Waters only cast me in Cry-Baby for my kitsch value. Sure, sometimes Terry Gilliam, Roman Polanski, or Jerry Bruckheimer will take pity on me and throw me a bone. Tim Burton has been charitable. I even thought that by playing the role of Hollywood outcast Ed Wood, I might be able to recapture some of the defiant spirit I had during my Jump Street days. But what happened? My costar, Martin Landau, got the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, and I got a one-way ticket to Palookaville. It's not like I haven't tried to hone in on what made Jump Street such a perfect role. I did Nick Of Time and Secret Window because the characters solved mysteries, like we all did on Jump Street. But it just wasn't the same as when the Jump team took orders from hard-nosed but sensitive Capt. Adam Fuller, our multi-ethnic police squad's kindly African-American mentor. And that old feeling, like I was making a difference in the lives of millions of young viewers across the country by tackling important teenage issues like race, drug addiction, and AIDS'that feeling was just gone.

""The team you trust to keep you informed is working to keep the greater Murfreesboro area'and your family'safe from Muslim extremists,"" said station manager Carl Bogert, unveiling the TerrorFirst! van at a press conference held in the ""Terrorist No Zone"" in the back parking lot. ""When terrorism threatens the people of central Tennessee, Fox 11 is there first. Watch Channel 11 for up-to-the-minute coverage of where, when, and how the enemies of freedom are coming to get you."" Painted red, white, and blue, the TerrorFirst! van is the first mobile unit devoted to monitoring terrorist threats on a local level. The van is equipped with live satellite feeds to and from the Fox News channel, a fax machine prepared to receive alerts from the Department of Homeland Security in Washington, an English-Arabic phrase book for translating any intercepted al-Qaeda correspondence, and a field-issue anthrax-detection kit. ""In a minute's notice, the van can be completely prepped, on the road, and speeding toward any site of terrorist activity within the WMFB broadcast area,"" Bogert said. ""Assuming two attacks don't happen concurrently, of course."" According to Bogert, the TerrorFirst! van features a rooftop satellite dish, a diesel-powered generator in case terrorists take down the Tennessee power grid, emergency snow chains for use in the event of a nuclear winter, a supply of promotional ""Fox 11 NewsEELooking Out For You""-shirts and bumper stickers, and a gun rack. The van is outfitted with several state-of-the-art monitoring systems, as well. ""TerrorDoppler can detect a dirty-bomb detonation of any significant magnitude from up to 40 miles away,"" Bogert said. ""The van can transmit a map of contaminated areas to the station for broadcast. That way, Fox 11 viewers gain valuable minutes'time which could be used to plan escape routes, call loved ones, and gather survival supplies.""

Although the only criminal activity the van has uncovered thus far was the illegal dumping of several quarts of used motor oil into the sewer, response from Fox 11 viewers has been overwhelmingly positive. ""When it comes to keeping me and my loved ones safe, Fox 11 is 'on the case!'"" said Murfreesboro resident Ed Nelson, expressing his enthusiasm about the new van to a Channel 11 camera crew. ""Seeing the Fox News terror-alert van parked in front of the credit union or driving through the Piggly Wiggly parking lot makes me feel secure."" Nelson, who will appear in an upcoming local Channel 11 advertisement, waved his index finger and added: ""Fox 11 News is number one in central Tennessee!"" Bogert ended the conference with some tough words for terrorists. ""Terrorists better think twice before targeting the good citizens of the greater Murfreesboro area,"" Bogert said. ""Terrorists, if you're watching, I have one thing to say to you: If you attack, the Fox 11 News team will be on the scene just minutes later."" Though Channel 11 currently has the only anti-terrorism news van in the country, plans are underway to use the concept at Fox affiliates nationwide..l","entertainment, tv, terrorism, media, television, poor, news, vol 41 issue 14, entertainment"

3362,"I Don't Care How Long It Takes, I'm Gonna Figure Out What That 'L' Word Is","I love a good mystery. When a television program gives you something to piece together, you have a reason to tune in every week. It's like a game. Alias, or 24'that's my kind of show. But I have got to tell you, The L Word really has me stumped. I'm going to figure out what that darn word is, though. I don't care how long it takes me. After seeing an episode, my first guess was that the ""L"" stood for ""ladies."" It made sense, because the show centers on a group of women and follows them as they navigate friendships, romantic entanglements, and life in California. While ""ladies"" is a strong guess, it's wrong. I know that, because a lot of the first season focused on the relationship between Tim and Jenny. (They had a rough patch in their relationship after Tim walked in on Jenny having a girl ""go downtown"" on her.) Given that much of the first season was about Tim'a man'it would be a cheat if the ""L"" word were ""ladies."" ""L"" wordEE "" wordEE Love? Lust? Liposuction? Lariat? Lonesome? This show is long on questions and short on answers, but I love a good puzzle, and I'm not giving up yet! I have to admit that I've missed a few episodes. Maybe they gave some important clues about the "" word in one of them. Or maybe, if I listened to the show's dialogue more closely, I'd figure it out. Sometimes I'm a bit too distracted by all the hot actresses making out with each other to catch every word. Well, I hope the second season comes out on DVD quickly, so I can give them all another look. I'll watch them as many times as it takes. I've got the patience to see this thing through. The show's title sequence is no help, that's for sure. They tease you with something like 50 words that start with the letter ""L."" Man! You know you're sitting there looking at the word, but they won't give you any clues as to which one is the one. Some that I remember offhand are Liberal, Lickable, Learn, Laughter, Lesbian, Lunch, Literary, Labels, and Loft. But what's the common thread? Oh, and it doesn't make it any easier that every episode title begins with an ""L."" Are the creators of this show trying to drive me insane? Well, I'm a patient man. I'm still writing letters in search of someone who can explain What's Eating Gilbert Grape to me. The ""L"" word mystery is no different: I have the stamina to stay on the case. In fact, a part of me doesn't want to figure it out. It's like when I figured out that Leland Palmer had killed Laura while inhabited by the dark spirit Bob. I was glad to know the answer to the mystery, but I was sorry Twin Peaks had come to an end. A good mystery show creates a cultural phenomenon. That's how it is, watching The L Word. Hmm, do you think it could be Loquacious? Nah. The show's subject matter isn't exactly intellectual, so I don't think the mystery word would be something so brainy. Don't worry'I'll get it eventually..oos","opinion, entertainment, human interest, tv, gay & lesbian, commentary, vol 41 issue 12, todd brillhaus, entertainment"

3364,Neverland Ranch Investigators Discover Corpse Of Real Michael Jackson,"SANTA BARBARA, CA'During a search for evidence at the Neverland Valley Ranch, investigators discovered a corpse that has been identified as that of Michael Jackson, Santa Barbara police officials announced Tuesday. ""Coroners have officially pronounced Michael Jackson dead. From what we can tell, he died between 18 and 20 years ago,"" forensic investigator Tim Holbrooke said. ""We are not certain, at this time, who'or what'has been standing trial in that Santa Maria courthouse."" According to Holbrooke, Jackson's corpse was buried just inches below a stretch of the miniature-train tracks that run throughout Neverland. The largely desiccated corpse wore the remains of a red, zipper-covered leather jacket and a single glove. ""We positively identified the body as Jackson by his dental records and DNA,"" Holbrooke said. ""But even before we conducted a single forensic test, we began to suspect that that we'd uncovered the real Michael, and that the disturbing figure claiming to be Jackson was a fake."" Holbrooke said that, although the corpse was in an advanced stage of decomposition, when investigators compared the body to early-career publicity photos of Jackson, they saw a striking resemblance in bone structure and facial features. But when they compared the body to photos taken after 1987, the resemblance was negligible. ""This discovery raises a lot of questions, but it also sheds light on a number of disturbing incidents,"" Holbrooke said. ""Frankly, Jackson had been acting pretty strange."" Forensic experts and music critics are postulating that Jackson was dead before the release of the multi-platinum album Bad. Detectives are currently analyzing the lyrics to ""Man In The Mirror"" for any clues relating to a look-alike entity that many suspect murdered the youngest member of the Jackson 5 and assumed his identity. ""We believe that Neverland served as some sort of freakishly whimsical tomb constructed by Jackson's killer,"" Holbrooke said. ""We also suspect that all of the iniquities that occurred on that ranch were the work of the imposter. I wouldn't have ever thought it possible, but we are looking at a situation where the sexual abuse of a 13-year-old cancer patient is the tip of the iceberg."" Holbrooke said that, while the living Jackson is the leading suspect in the murder investigation, he ""could be another victim of some sort."" ""Basically, we have no idea what type of creature we are dealing with,"" Holbrooke said. A member of the investigative team that discovered Jackson's body described the experience as ""otherworldly."" ""As we neared the perimeter of Neverland, the dogs started whining and howling like crazy,"" Santa Barbara County detective Frank Poeller said. ""We had to pull them into the house. When we got to Jackson's bedroom, one of them almost choked himself to death on his leash trying to get out through the window. Minutes later, the same dog led us to the corpse."" A representative from Jackson's self-created label, MJJ Productions, said he was not surprised to find out that the current Jackson is an imposter. ""When we were recording 'Heal The World' for Dangerous, I could tell something was terribly, terribly wrong,"" MJJ manager Luke Allard said. ""Michael didn't seem like himself anymore. He'd demand bizarre food and sit for hours in a hyperbaric chamber. His appearance began to become more and more peculiar. Soon afterwards, he started wearing a mask and confiding in a chimpanzee."" ""I remember thinking, 'This man has become a monster,'"" Allard said. ""If only I'd known how right I was."" Allard said he thinks that the imposter broke ties with Jackson's former friends and surrounded himself with children who were too young to notice the radical change. Vanity Fair reporter Beth Pither visited Neverland in 1994. ""A strangely fearful staff member led me to Jackson, but ran off before I opened the door,"" Pither said. ""Standing there with my hand on an ice-cold doorknob, I heard strange, unnatural sounds'leathery wings flapping, a sorrowful wail, and loud hissing. A wave of dread passed through me as I opened the door, but all I found was Michael and some kids in pajamas eating ice cream and watching 101 Dalmatians."" While their claims have not been corroborated, other Neverland visitors have reported that when Jackson entered a room, lights flickered, faucets ran blood-red, and screams escaped from the walls. To aid in the investigation, the FBI enlisted Dr. Richard Weingarden, a noted expert on the paranormal from UC Santa Barbara. After only two hours, Weingarden abandoned the project. ""The smell of sulfur, the decaying facial features, the bizarrely high-pitched voice'it sounds exactly likeEE""eingarden said, trailing off. ""I'm sure it's nothing. Not a big deal. Nothing to be terrified about, certainly. I have to go. I've got a family."" Thomas Sneddon, the prosecutor in Jackson's child-molestation lawsuit, said it remains to be seen how the shocking discovery will affect the trial. Megan Gustafson, who left her post as president of the Akron, OH Michael Jackson Fan Club after the singer was accused of molestation, offered a positive view of the grisly revelation. ""This is very disturbing news,"" Gustafson said. ""But to be honest, it's kind of a relief too. Thriller and Off The Wall are really amazing records. Now I can pull them out of my 'ruined by child abuse' storage bin and start listening to them again.""""a","entertainment, celebrities, death, michael jackson, news, vol 41 issue 11, entertainment"

3368,Jude Law's First 100 Days As People Magazine's Sexiest Man Alive,"HOLLYWOOD'All eyes are squarely fixed on Jude Law as he comes to the 100-day mark in his tenure as People magazine's Sexiest Man Alive 2004. ""You can't overstate the importance of the Sexiest Man Alive's first 100 days,"" said Veronica Giulletti, associate editor of People. ""They set the tone for his entire term. The whole world is looking at him to see what is sexy."" In November, Law emerged as the new sexiest man alive, after a fiercely contested, sexy race that pitted him against such hunks as Orlando Bloom, Colin Farrell, and two-time winner Brad Pitt. ""Law's ascension was not a mandate, remember,"" Giulletti said. ""The Sexiest Man Alive issue featured a complete list of heart-stoppers who ranged in age from 22 to 58. It included 34 actors, 10 singers, a baseball player, and a poker champ. If Law ever starts to rest on his laurels, he need only open his copy of the Nov. 17, 2004 issue. That photo spread is a stark, sexy reminder of the challenges the Sexiest Man Alive faces."" According to Giulletti, the Sexiest Man Alive receives the most media attention at the very beginning of his term. While some sexy men use the news coverage as an opportunity to introduce radical changes to their looks, Giulletti said that Law chose to stay the course. ""Jude came into office with a big, sexy plan in place,"" Giulletti said. ""He'd spent years tweaking and refining his dapper image, so it was wise that he chose to stick with it."" Throughout his first 100 days, Law earned public-approval ratings ranging from the high 60s to the low 80s. ""While Jude's look is too conservative for some tastes, no one can deny that he conveys a strong, focused, well-honed sexiness,"" Giulletti said. ""He has gorgeous cheekbones, sensual lips, and lovely blue eyes. His frame, while not Russell Crowe studly, certainly isn't too twee either."" Entertainment-industry pundits have lauded Law for his savvy campaign to distinguish himself from his predecessor, 2003's Sexiest Man Alive Johnny Depp. ""Johnny was sexy,"" entertainment writer Cami Stoeffer said. ""That said, many People readers were disappointed by his administration. They felt the energy he expended overseas was in excess. Some took all that jet-setting as an indication that Johnny didn't care about making America a sexier place."" In contrast to Depp, Law introduced a ""sexy by example"" style of leadership, aggressively undertaking a highly publicized campaign advocating short-cropped hairstyles for men. ""Sexy-people-watchers advocate Jude's aggressive stance on haircuts,"" Stoeffer said. ""It's a traditional platform, but Law has done well with his campaign to present a carefully styled, finished look. In fact, in a recent phone poll, 82 percent of women ages 18-34 agreed that Law is a total fox."" Nonetheless, critics are quick to point out Law's missteps. Nelson Garcia, writer for the National Enquirer, said Law's first 100 days have been ""a fiasco."" ""From his overly gelled hair on the set of his forthcoming film All The King's Men to his hosting of Saturday Night Live on the night of Ashlee Simpson's lip-synching debacle, Jude Law has been an embarrassment to the entertainment world,"" Garcia said. ""And let's not forget his visit to the Los Angeles Children's Hospital. It was a great chance to raise pulses nationwide by showing up in a well-worn sleeveless T-shirt and gym shoes. Instead, he looked like a dandy out on the court. Now, Matt Damon'there's a guy who could look good playing basketball with below-average-looking kids."" Mel Gibson, who was named People's first Sexiest Man Alive in 1985, urged the public to support Law. ""Jude has some challenges ahead of him, but I support him completely,"" Gibson said. ""The Sexiest Man Alive is only human. It's not fair to attack him every time he looks tired or is seen in a club that isn't hip. Jude deserves a chance to show us what he's got'both in his riveting dramatic roles and in photos of him with his shirt off.""","entertainment, celebrities, news, vol 41 issue 08, entertainment"

3370,Michael Moore Honored With New Ben & Jerry's Flavor,"BURLINGTON, VT'Ben & Jerry's, the Vermont-based ice-cream manufacturer known for its progressive social mission, held a press conference Monday to introduce a new flavor celebrating Academy Award winner Michael Moore. ""I'm really excited to announce the newest Ben & Jerry's ice-cream flavor,"" said Chrystie Heimert, Ben & Jerry's director of public relations. ""In the spirit of Michael Moore's tasteful, playful calls for justice, we have created a tasteful, playful flavor: The Waffle Truth."" The Waffle Truth will honor the dynamic visionary by combining premium vanilla ice cream with strawberries, chocolate-covered waffle-cone bits, and a hint of cinnamon. The ice cream will be available in Ben & Jerry's Scoop Shops Friday, followed by a retail rollout in March. ""Making an ice-cream flavor that would do justice to such an important author and filmmaker wasn't easy,"" Heimert said. ""We knew we'd be using ingredients bought at fair-market prices, but exactly what those ingredients would be was a source of a lot of good old-fashioned, honest, open debate."" Heimert said developers experimented with a host of possible ice-cream tributes to the best-selling author, including Stupid White Chocolate, Green Tea Nation, and Dude, Where's My Coconut? Even after Ben & Jerry's decided what the new flavor would contain, developers struggled to perfect the name. ""We thought about calling it Cherry-heit 9-11, but we already have Cherry Garcia,"" Heimert said. ""Fahrenheit 31.1 was the next choice, but we didn't think everyone would make the connection between the proper temperature for storing ice cream and the film that broke the theatrical documentary box-office record by seamlessly blending comedy with hard-hitting fact."" ""We also considered a name reminiscent of our popular Chubby Hubby flavor,"" Heimert said. ""But in the end, we decided The Waffle Truth would be more respectful to Moore's achievements than a flavor called Hefty Lefty."" Ben & Jerry's has previously honored pop-culture icons Phish and Jerry Garcia, as well as the TV show Seinfeld. This is the first time that the company has honored a director. ""Michael Moore's David-and-Goliath commentaries cut conservative bigwigs down to size,""Heimert said. ""He follows the beat of his own drummer and works in his own unique way to improve the average American's life. Our choice was a natural'just like our ice cream: We use only fresh milk and cream bought from farmers that have pledged never to use recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone."" Added Heimert: ""We believe that Michael will remain an important voice in American politics, and that we will find no need to discontinue The Waffle Truth, as we did Wavy Gravy, Doonesberry Sorbet, and Dilbert's World Totally Nuts."" The Emmy Award winner made a surprise appearance at the Ben & Jerry's Scoop Shop in Times Square to support the product. ""I'm honored Ben & Jerry's decided to dedicate an ice cream to me,"" Moore told the excited crowd. ""It's a fantastic company with a great track record of treating their employees fairly and using only ethically produced ingredients."" ""Plus, a lifetime supply of ice cream sounds pretty good,"" Moore added, patting his stomach with a self-deprecating laugh. According to Ben & Jerry's press materials, The Waffle Truth rollout will include a nationwide tour by the company's promotional ice-cream wagon. The tour will begin its journey in Flint, MI and continue south to distribute free pints of ice cream in 14 Rust Belt cities suffering from post-industrial decline. Other Ben & Jerry's flavors slated for introduction in 2005 are Praline Kael, Noam ChompChompsky Crunch, Ché Guava, and Nelson Vanilla, an anti-apartheid flavor that consists of a dark-chocolate sorbet swirled in an equal amount of vanilla ice cream.","entertainment, celebrities, food, movies, fitness, cooking, news, vol 41 issue 07, entertainment"

I would never go pee-pee on you when you were holding me in your hand. I go poopy outside. I don't let it run right out of my rear end on the floor of my stinky little pen and then jump around in it all day. I have a cute leather button nose that I sniff, sniff, sniff with. Look at it! Do you see how cute my little nose is? Arf! Arf! Arf! So don't you want to hug me? Hug me! I will grow up into a doggie that will love you and be your friend. I will love you so much, and you will love me too! Ooh! I am getting so sleepy! I think I will take a little puppy nap. And then, when I wake up from my nap, I will be refreshed and ready to play.

3378,I Wish I Were One Of TV's Golden Girls,"Ever since my fall, I've been watching a lot more TV. It's lucky, too, because I've discovered the most delightful new show. It's called The Golden Girls. It's on every day at 5:30 p.m. on channel 14 and is about four women, Dorothy, Blanche, Rose, and Sophia, who are getting on in years, just like me. And, like me, they have no husbands, and their children rarely visit or call. In the past, I never looked at the ""boob tube"" much. Other than watching the Weather Channel to check for storm advisories for Cincinnati, where my daughter Emily lives, I barely even turned the thing on. But with Harold gone two years this month and me not really trusting myself to take the bus to church anymore'not to mention the broken hip'let's just say I've had a lot of time on my hands. I can't even crochet or sew anymore because of the arthritis, so rather than just sitting in my blue chair staring at the wall for hours, I've started to look at the TV. Lately, the highlight of each day is when I tune in to see what's going on in the lives of these Golden Girls. It's such a nice escape to be able to step into this wonderful world where older women wear stylish clothing, say lots of clever things, and, judging from the way they are always on the go, have no problems with bursitis, high blood pressure, or hemorrhoids. The Golden Girls have a lovely Florida home with a full patio and breakfast nook, and they go on vacations and take dance classes together. Sometimes, I try to imagine what it would be like if their house had one more bedroom, and I lived there. Though I don't think it would be appropriate to date at my age, I would very much enjoy the companionship of some good friends. I would readily agree to do all the housework if it meant I had someone to talk to once in a while. And if I fractured my hip, I would have the assurance that I wouldn't have to lay on the floor in pain for three days, waiting each day for the mailman's footsteps so I could cry out in the hopes of getting his attention. Of course, living in a house full of women is bound to cause some tension, especially when everyone has such different personalities. Sophia is grumpy and always has some smart-alecky thing to say. (At first, I didn't like her much, but I soon saw that even she has a soft side. Besides, you have to be tough living in Brooklyn.) Dorothy, Sophia's daughter, inherited her mother's mouth and is the unofficial leader of the gang. Blanche, a wild Southern belle, is quite the narcissist. Rose, on the other hand, is sweet and dim-witted. She reminds me of my dear sister Lydia, who passed on last year. Sometimes, one of Rose's silly remarks about small-town life brings me to tears, making me think about how much I miss my one and only sibling, who is gone forever. The Golden Girls often get mad at each other. At times, they even resort to calling each other nasty names, using words I don't think one should be able to say on television. But at the end of the day, they always find a way to patch things up and become the best of friends again. I sure wish I had some friends living close by. Ruth, my best friend of 51 years, is in a home down in Emmetsville. I haven't seen her since Christmas of 2002, and at that point, she didn't recognize me or her own children anymore. My, it looks so sunny and beautiful down there in Florida. It's terribly cold up here. I'm so frightened of catching pneumonia like Harold did, I hardly leave the house during the winter anymore. I signed up for Meals On Wheels last month, and most days, they drop by with something to eat, so I don't have to turn the stove on anymore. (I accidentally left the gas on last December but, luckily, the neighbors smelled it and pounded on my door.) I do get jealous of the Golden Girls, how they have each other. But I need to remember that it's not all cake and ice cream for them. They've had to face some very difficult situations recently, like when Dorothy found a lump in her breast, and the time Blanche found out that her late husband had fathered an illegitimate child, and when Rose was cut off from her husband's pension.

3379,Department Of Libel: Drew Carey Killed A Guy And Paid To Cover It Up,"WASHINGTON, DC'According to a report released Monday by the U.S. Department of Libel, comedian and TV star Drew Carey killed a guy back in the 1980s, then paid this other guy to keep it all hush-hush. ""I know it seems wild, but it really happened,"" Libel Secretary Brent Roderick told reporters at a morning press conference. ""Back in, like, '85 or '86, while he was still living in Ohio, Drew Carey went apeshit one night and beat this guy to death with a golf club in the back room of some bar. For no reason at all. Then he realized that this other guy had seen it, so he paid the guy $500 not to rat him out to the cops. That's why no one knew for so long."" Roderick said the Libel Department received the information on June 20 from ""a friend of a friend of the guy Carey paid off."" He characterized the source as ""100 percent reliable."" Marvin Strand, Carey's attorney, vehemently denied the allegations. ""In all my years practicing law, I have never encountered a more blatant case of libel and slander,"" Strand said. ""This is a malicious, wholly unfounded smear campaign whose sole purpose is to destroy the reputation of my client. And to think a taxpayer-funded arm of the federal government is behind it. We are definitely taking legal action."" Despite Strand's plans to file a $160 million defamation lawsuit and the absence of any hard evidence supporting the allegations, the Libel Department is sticking to its claims. ""Long story short, in the '80s, Carey's career was going nowhere. No comedy club wanted to touch him because his delivery sucked and his material was shit. And it certainly didn't help that he was so fat and unattractive'he had those dumb glasses even then,"" Roderick said. ""Plus, he was really unhappy because he'd been kicked out of the American Nazi Party, and his relationship with [mass murderer] Richard Speck was on the rocks, and his ongoing horse-tranquilizer addiction had placed him in a pretty bizarre state of mind, to say the least. So, when you consider all of that, it's not too surprising that he snapped and lashed out violently the way he did."" Added Roderick: ""They never did find the guy's arms."" If Strand follows through on his threat of legal action, it will not be the first time the Libel Department has been sued. Since its creation in 1916, the department has defended itself in court more than 4,600 times for its groundless accusations against various high-profile individuals. The department has lost every case, costing U.S. taxpayers an estimated $985 billion in damages. Among the Libel Department's more infamous accusations: In 1923, it asserted that swashbuckling movie idol Douglas Fairbanks raped Archduke Franz Ferdinand with a Coke bottle, touching off WWI; in 1932, it alleged that the murdered infant son of famed aviator Charles Lindbergh had actually committed suicide; and in 1953, it divulged that Woolworth heiress Barbara Hutton was raised by a pack of mandrills. Earlier this year, a New York district court judge ordered the department to pay talk-show host Rosie O'Donnell $24 million for falsely claiming that in 1998 she embarked on a Central Park rampage in which she fatally stabbed a developmentally disabled 6-year-old and a swan. His department's losing streak notwithstanding, Roderick said he is looking forward to his day in court. ""From its founding to the present day, the Libel Department has never wavered in its commitment to its mission, and in terms of efficiency, we top all other government agencies,"" Roderick said. ""We've done a good job and, although we have our naysayers on Capitol Hill and in Hollywood, we intend to continue our important work into the next decade and beyond."" ""Plus,"" Roderick continued, ""I've got some unbelievable info on Julia Roberts. You'll shit your pants when you read this. She won't seem like America's sweetheart when you hear what she did to land her role in Mystic Pizza, believe you me.""","entertainment, celebrities, crime, news, vol 40 issue 52, entertainment"

3381,Desperate Times Call For Desperate Housewives,"We Americans are not strangers to hardship. We have endured economic woes, enmity between the states, and protracted campaigns in foreign lands. We have survived imperialist wars; we have survived unexpected attacks; we have seen countless lives wasted. Since America declared its independence, each successive generation has met a unique and unexpected challenge, but ours is the first to face the worst hardships of many generations in legion. Fellow citizens, we are living in desperate times, and desperate times call for Desperate Housewives. Each morning, our newspapers bring reports of chaos in the Mideast, violence in our schools, and a leadership in disarray. Our televisions, once cynosures for placid reflection, are now given to reports of violence and injustice. Maintaining our purity of heart while staring into the widening chasm of world events is a task for which many of us feel ill-equipped. In times like these, we must fix our gaze upon Wisteria Lane. For, as everyone here at ABC can assure you, there is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with Desperate Housewives. On the surface, our nation is sharply divided between the red states and the blue. But look deeper, tune in, and watch as Bree Van De Kamp bonds unexpectedly with Mary Alice's troubled son Zach. At the heart of our great nation is a friendship between Bree and Zach. And so watch Desperate Housewives, and find out what lies buried beneath Mary Alice's pool. When you do, I promise that it will be every bit as emotionally satisfying as the revelation that Mrs. Huber wrote the mysterious note that Mary Alice received before her untimely death. QuestionsEE DoubtsEE Will single-mom Susan find new love with Mike Delfino? What sort of ""ber"" is Mike, anyway? And what of Lynette, who has deferred her dreams of corporate success? What of the lawnboy, who takes his affair with Gabrielle to heart? Friends, dare to leave conundrums unsolved, unsimplified. For Desperate Housewives, like America's participatory democracy, is always changing, infinite in its variety'sometimes turbulent'and all the more valuable for having had its shocking conclusion shaped by focus groups from multiple demographics. Stay tuned! This week's episode is a doozy. Yes, allow chaos. Allow mystery. For our nation was not shaped by short, 30-minute outbursts of emotion, but by the tranquil and steady dedication of Rex Van De Kamp, who agreed to seek counseling to rectify his marriage with Bree. Tune in, America. For, without the collective efforts of many, we Americans will find ourselves doing much worse than burning down our neighbors' houses, taking our childrens' medication, and almost bringing down the entire NFL through our lascivious pre-game locker-room seduction of Terrell Owens. To paraphrase George Santayana: A man's feet must be planted in his country, but his eyes should follow ABC's Sunday primetime line-up, with Extreme Makeover at 8:00 p.m. EST, Desperate Housewives at 9:00 p.m. EST, and liberty and justice for all.oonn","opinion, entertainment, economy, commentary, vol 40 issue 50, eric wendt, entertainment"

3386,"Oprah Celebrates 20,000th Pound Lost","CHICAGO'Talk-show superstar Oprah Winfrey celebrated losing her 20,000th pound in a star-packed gala at the Sutton Place Hotel in Chicago's Gold Coast Monday night. ""Tonight is an amazing personal milestone,"" Winfrey said. ""I want everyone who has supported me through the years'my friends, my loved ones, and all of my wonderful fans'to share the joy I feel tonight in having shed my 20,000th pound."" According to her spokesman, Winfrey has been on 674 diets, embarked on 255 fitness routines, and weighed herself 4,349,571 times during her 30-year career in broadcasting and film. Luminaries such as John Travolta, Bernie Mac, Patti LaBelle, U.S. Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-NY), Billy Crystal, Dr. Phil McGraw, and longtime boyfriend Stedman Graham joined the Oprah Winfrey Show staff in honoring the media icon's monumental achievements in weight loss. The historic event was also showcased on Monday's episode of Oprah. Following a standing ovation from her studio audience, Winfrey explained that, during a weigh-in last Tuesday, she discovered that she had lost another pound, bringing her weight down to 139. ""I was recording my weight in my journal,"" Winfrey said. ""You can imagine how excited and proud I was when I discovered that my one-pound loss that morning nudged my lifetime total toEE 20,000 pounds!""ver the audience's cheers, Winfrey added: ""20,000 pounds! 20,000 pounds!"" The milestone follows Winfrey's recent loss of 33 pounds, following a protracted ballooning to 200 pounds, not long after a loss of more than 100. ""Oprah is absolutely extraordinary,"" said friend Gayle King, who helped organize the event. ""Not only is she a talk-show host, actor, entertainment mogul, and philanthropist, but she's also a super-dieter. Oprah is so capable at what she does that she makes weight loss look easy. But it takes faith, staying power, and single-minded focus to keep losing thousands of pounds, gaining them back, and then losing them again."" Fans have lauded Winfrey for inspiring them to change their attitude toward weight loss. ""I felt horrible when I gained back the 60 pounds I'd worked so hard to lose,"" wrote one fan on an Oprah.com message board. ""But Oprah has gained and lost that much countless times over. If she can do it, I can, too. Thanks, Oprah!"" Another fan wrote that she ""share[s] Oprah's struggle."" ""Pound number 428 and counting!"" the post read. ""Last week I gained five, and this week I lost two! Thanks, Oprah! Bless you for teaching me to be as fat or as thin as I can!"" The most eloquent tribute came from Maya Angelou, the celebrated author and poet, and a personal friend of Winfrey's. During the celebration, Angelou read a poem dedicated to Winfrey, ""Water Into Air."" ""As I lose, I gain,"" Angelou said. ""I wing home to a place long forgotten. I swell as I recede, taking in all that has come before me. I molt. I shed. I diminish. But I feel no loss for I am free. My song slips its long confinement and joins the celestial roar. I was made of water, now I am air. I lose as I gain, but again I lose. I lose. I lose."" Far ahead of other celebrity weight-losers Rosie O'Donnell (15,860 pounds) and Roseanne Barr (7,229 pounds), Winfrey nevertheless appears determined to top her own record. ""I am going to ask my personal chef to whip me up some more of these breaded filet mignon appetizers,"" Winfrey said, piling her plate with filets during a post-celebration party.

3392,Long-Lost Jules Verne Short Story 'The Camera-Phone' Found,"AMIENS, FRANCE'Literary scholars announced Monday that they have unearthed a 33-page handwritten manuscript of ""The Camera-Phone,"" a short story believed to have been written in 1874 by French novelist Jules Verne, the man often considered to be the originator of modern science fiction. ""The discovery of this highly prophetic work is exciting in both a literary and a social context,"" Jean-Michel Frelseien of the Ecole-Polytechnique said Monday. ""This story of a hand-held communications and picture-taking device that leads to social upheaval in 21st-century France provides yet another example of Verne's celebrated prescience."" ""Le Telephon-Photographique,"" which Frelseien identified as having been written just after Verne's masterpiece 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea, is narrated by Gui Cingulaire, the nephew of brilliant but monomaniacal professor Bernard Cingulaire. An ambitious, gifted scientist, Bernard fails to predict that his invention, a portable telephone that can take photographs and send short script messages, will contribute to the breakdown of traditional manners among Parisians. Frelseien said the manuscript was found among the belongings of Verne's publisher, Pierre-Jules Hertzel, along with an uncompleted letter rejecting the work as ""pessimistic, preposterous, and unappealing in premise."" ""Verne's view of a 21st-century Paris overrun by camera-phone-toting nabobs is indeed dismal,"" Frelseien said. ""But in all of its particulars, the story is classic Verne. The main character is a strong-minded and brilliant scientist-inventor, symbolizing the ambition and drive of the Industrial Age. The clever but wide-eyed narrator's breathless appetite for knowledge pulls the reader along. And the technological centerpiece of the story'as usual, powered by Verne's beloved electricity'sets the stage for conflict between the characters."" ""Where the story departs from a typical Verne piece, however, is in the level of devastation wrought by the innovation,"" Frelseien added. ""The infuriated victims of the camera-phone-dominated society eventually put all of Europe to the torch."" The story, which has yet to be translated into English, has been lauded by literary scholars around the world. ""It's an absolutely wonderful and engaging piece of work,"" Harvard professor of French literature Neil McGraw said. ""Professor Cingulaire, a noted eccentric, is convinced by his unscrupulous creditors to patent and market his long-distance-communications and image-transmission device, in spite of his misgivings. At first, use of the phone is prevalent only among the bourgeois, but it soon spreads throughout social strata."" As use of the device becomes commonplace, McGraw said, normal societal relations between citizens break down. ""Rudeness becomes ubiquitous, as the device's infuriating notification-chimes invade every corner of public life,"" McGraw said. ""When the ethically bereft begin transmitting images obtained under questionable circumstances, espionage becomes so prevalent as to threaten the integrity of the French populace."" Frelseien and other scholars at the Ecole-Polytechnique are searching for other unpublished stories mentioned in the recently recovered papers, including ""The Massaging-Chair,"" ""Incident At A Café Of Thinking-Machines,"" and ""The Satellite Initiative For Strategic Defense.""","entertainment, books, innovation, science fiction, news, vol 40 issue 41, entertainment"

3395,"Alvin Shunned By Animal Community, Forced To Wear Scarlet 'A'","PASADENA, CA'Well-known frontman for Alvin & The Chipmunks, the singing group that included his brothers Simon and Theodore, Alvin Seville is adored by millions for his intricate vocals on such playful songs as ""Alvin's Harmonica"" and ""The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don't Be Late)."" The chipmunk celebrates his 70th birthday this month, as well as his 46th year bearing the scarlet letter ""A""'the mark of shame that reminds members of the animal kingdom that he is an actor who has adopted the ways of humankind. ""'A singer of people-songs!'"" said the Seville family's former tax accountant, echoing the cries raised against Alvin so many years ago. ""'What kind of a business in life'what mode of glorifying Mother Nature, of being serviceable to chipmunks?' Such were the comments bandied between leaf and twig, chattered from branch to branch! And yet, let them scorn Alvin as they would, strong traits of their nature had intertwined themselves with his."" In 1958, members of the Woodland Council forced Alvin to sew a scarlet, gold-embroidered ""A"" on his sweater. They then paraded him before his forest peers and exiled him to a split-level ranch home on the outskirts of Los Angeles. ""When 'The Witch Doctor' became a success, the animal community seized upon Alvin's 'unholy' communion with humankind,"" entertainment writer Seth Morris said. ""By today's standards, it seems barbaric to ostracize a chipmunk because of a relatively harmless series of novelty recordings. It was a different time then."" According to Morris, Alvin's father sent the chipmunk to Hollywood while still an infant, with the stated intention of following later. The elder animal remained in the forest, however, leaving Alvin and his brothers alone in the human world. It was then that Alvin met Seville, who developed a liking for the chipmunks and adopted them as his own children. ""So moody and mischievous were Alvin and his brothers that people used to joke that their birth father was actually the devil,"" the accountant said. ""But Dave truly loved the chipmunks, and so he was torn, for he knew the human-animal bond to be unnatural."" While Alvin refused to identify the father who'd abandoned him, many say he bears an uncanny likeness to popular entertainer Dale, a singing, dancing chipmunk who arrived in Hollywood around the time of Alvin's downfall. ""Dale could see there was something between Alvin and Dave,"" Morris said. ""Alvin was heartbroken to have been made a pariah, but he bore it stoically, pouring all of his energy into his songs and his television programs."" While the animals publicly rallied against Alvin, many privately expressed admiration for both his bravery and the speed and pitch of his plaintive, almost human vocals. ""Alvin, with a mind of native courage and activity, outlawed from the wilds, wandered among the suburbs and studios of mankind,"" the accountant said. ""The scarlet letter was his passport into regions other chipmunks dared not tread. Fame, adoration, applause! These were his teachers'stern and wild ones'and they made him strong, but taught him much amiss."" For many years, Seville refused comment on his relationship with Alvin. ""Dave felt terrible guilt over luring Alvin from the animal world and subjecting him to so much pain at the paws of his peers,"" inventor and Alvin costar Clyde Crashcup said. ""At one concert, he came very close to taking the microphone and admitting to that which was animal in his own nature, just as Alvin had been forced to own up to his trespasses into humanity. But ultimately, Dave was too afraid."" ""It was only seconds later that a lighting rig fell, forming a giant letter 'A' behind the set,"" Crashcup added. In the controversial final episode of The Alvin Show, however, Seville appeared before a live studio audience, acknowledged his relationship with Alvin, and tore open his shirt to reveal an ""A""-shaped skin discoloration on his chest. Shortly afterward, he died, his final word the plaintive call, ""Alllviiin!"" Alvin withdrew from the limelight with the cancellation of his last TV series, Alvin & The Chipmunks. While he has periodically returned to the studio to record covers of such popular songs as ""Achy Breaky Heart"" and ""The Macarena,"" Alvin has spent the past decade largely in seclusion. ""Alvin made the choice to go back to the suburban home that had once been his place of banishment,"" the accountant said. ""Here had been his sin; here, his sorrow; and here is yet to be his penitence. He has returned, therefore, and resumed of his own free will, the symbol of which I have related so dark a tale. But the scarlet letter has ceased to be a stigma which attracted the world's scorn and bitterness, and has become something to be sorrowed over, and looked upon with awe, and yet with reverence, too.""","entertainment, animals, tv, scandal, morality, news, vol 40 issue 39, entertainment"
3396,Matchbox Twenty Finally Finishes Watering Down Long-Awaited New Album,"LOS ANGELES'Executives at Atlantic Records announced Monday that multi-platinum recording artist Matchbox Twenty, which set sales records in 2000 for its mega-hit release Mad Season, has finally finished watering down tracks on its long-awaited new album Beige. ""Everyone here at Atlantic is thrilled about what's sure to be the biggest-selling, least-rocking record of the year,"" Atlantic public-relations spokeswoman Janet Cosgrove said. ""It's been a long wait, but the incredibly boring results speak for themselves. Beige is bigger and blander than anything Matchbox Twenty has ever done."" ""Grab a chair, America!"" she added. ""The most uninteresting band in formulaic, corporate radio is back!"" The release has been eagerly awaited by Matchbox Twenty's enormous fan base, composed of American record buyers who have a limited interest in music but enjoy the act of shopping. In order to satisfy the undemanding non-tastes of this lucrative market, Matchbox Twenty has made every effort to create what record-industry insiders say is the band's least distinctive album yet. ""Some were disappointed with the relatively limited reception to Matchbox Twenty's 2002 release More Than You Think You Are,"" Rolling Stone contributing editor Nathan Brackett said. ""That album proved what record executives have known for years: It's actually very difficult to record a rock record that has no rock in it at all. But with this new release, Matchbox Twenty has really delivered on its signature non-sound."" After the enormous commercial success of 1996's Yourself Or Someone Like You, demand for simplistic, cookie-cutter output from the band has been high. Yet, according to Grammy-winning lead vocalist Rob Thomas, the new record's release was delayed repeatedly because of Matchbox Twenty's perfectionism in the studio. ""Our goal was to follow in the tradition of great multi-platinum artists like Elton John, Phil Collins, and the Dave Matthews Band'sales powerhouses who relied on the musical ignorance of their fans,"" Thomas told reporters following Monday's announcement. ""We knew that if we wanted to match those historic giants for sheer lack of energy, we couldn't settle for anything less than total banality. And, though it took a lot of time and effort, I think we achieved that'an album that sets a new standard for trite crapola."" ""It's really derivative and boring,"" he added. Thomas said it was the expectations of listeners that drove the band to create the most average music possible. ""We wanted to give our fans exactly what they've come to expect: music so inoffensive and indistinct that it could be played virtually anywhere'a bank lobby, an SUV stuck in traffic, a party full of aging stockbrokers and their girlfriends. That's no small task. Even a lot of the most vacant and unimaginative people have some capacity to actively engage in the music they're listening to."" According to band members, hundreds of hours were spent in the studio trying to render the sound adequately benign. ""No matter how many times we recorded the new single 'Sitting Down (Hands At My Side),' there was still a certain 'oomph' coming through in the drums, a loud-ish, slightly gripping sound that we couldn't remove,"" drummer Paul Doucette said. ""Finally, after running them through about two dozen filters, we managed to get that 'plastic spork hitting mashed potatoes' sound we were after."" There was a similar problem, band members said, with the guitar solos, some of which contained trace elements of what musicians call ""passion."" In addition, the interplay among bass, drums, and guitars occasionally produced uncomfortable polyrhythmic effects that provoked unintentional toe-tapping or head-bobbing in listeners. The problems were fixed through extensive re-recording. ""I'm satisfied that all the watering-down we put into this album was worth it,"" Thomas said. ""My lyrics are super-bland, the bass might as well have been recorded on a keyboard, and just wait until you hear how dull we managed to make the guitars sound. It's amazing."" The band will introduce the album's first single next week on MTV's hugely popular, entirely insipid show Total Request Live.","entertainment, music, news, vol 40 issue 38, entertainment"

Happy birthday, Carl. We got you a cakeEE 42, right? Wow.""till, the prospect of finding a new career is so daunting. Especially now that I've started to earn benefits. I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. Then there's my personal life. If only there were some way to improve my relationships. I really don't have a lot of friends. The few times I do get invited to a party, I usually end up sitting alone in the kitchen, loathing everyone else. Sometimes, I get the nagging feeling that if I could simply learn how to communicate more effectively, I'd not only have more friends, but I'd get along with my family, too. Maybe I'd even be married. I usually try to shake that feeling off, because I don't have the slightest clue how to change the way I interact with others. I'm positive there's a better life out there for me. But every time I try to imagine what it might include, I get confused and frustrated. What I need is a plan of action, but it feels like I'll never find one that isn't impossible. As I go to sleep at night, I'm often gripped by the fear that I'm going to die poor, unloved, and unfulfilled. Isn't there someone out there who can help me? Are you someone who lies on the living-room couch, hoping that something is going to drop out of the sky and make your life better? Have your friends and family'even people you barely know'heard you wish, over and over, that there was something you could do? Does it seem hopeless? Do you wish your life was better?

I know what you're going through. Before I created my Total Forward Thinking plan, I knew that the life I was living was not for me. I was renting a cramped, dirty studio apartment.

Thanks to the Total Forward Thinking principles, my wonderful family and I now live in a $2 million house that overlooks the ocean. I couldn't be happier!

3400,Comedian Given Sitcom Out Of Pity,"BURBANK, CA'Now What?, an ABC sitcom making its debut next week, was created for struggling stand-up comic Warren Morris out of pity, sources at ABC Comedy Development said Monday. ""Warren's long since paid his dues, and this is probably the only opportunity he'll get,"" programming executive Denise Scudder said. ""Though his jokes aren't particularly funny, he is hard-working and likable. I thought, 'What the hell? Let's throw him a bone.'"" Now What? will star Morris, 42, as Warren Barber, a video editor at a small Midwestern production company. Barber, who dreams of seeing his own film ideas produced one day, is a good-natured but absent-minded everyman whose misadventures inspire varied reactions in assorted coworkers and friends, as well as his ever-skeptical wife, played by Kathy Griffin. A nationally touring comic since 1990, Morris has spent the past 14 years performing in such venues as Cockamamie's in Beloit, WI, and Laffghanistan in Erie, PA. In spite of years of experience in comedy, the heavy-set, balding Michigan native has remained on the fringes of the entertainment industry. ""Morris landed a half-hour special on Comedy Central in 1997, but the break didn't lead to anything bigger,"" Morris' booking agent Karla Hoffman said. ""If he's known for anything, it's his material about compulsive eating and girlfriends who are smarter than him. Even if audiences don't remember Warren's name later, they usually laugh when he says, 'MustEE stop' and 'Um, I don't think so, honey.'"" July 2003 appearance at the Just For Laughs comedy festival in Montreal marked a turning point in Morris' career. One of 27 comedians showcased in the festival's Club Series, Morris and his slightly offbeat act caught the attention of Scudder and ABC talent coordinator Tamara Felbet. ""While not laugh-out-loud funny, Warren had a familiar presence,"" Felbet said. ""A lot of people relate to his sort of harmless-slob image. He had a joke about buying new underwear instead of doing laundry and one about how, instead of washing a spoon, he ate his Ben & Jerry's with a pair of take-out chopsticks. That's exactly the kind of observational humor that's perfect for filling 22 minutes."" ""We're always on the lookout for fresh new talent, but a lot of the acts we saw in Montreal were a little too weird,"" Felbet continued. ""And, unlike a lot of the comics there, Warren seemed like a really nice guy. He sorta reminded me of my brother."" Within a week of his Montreal appearance, Morris signed a talent deal with the network. After passing on a pitch for a half-hour series that would have starred Morris as a parking-enforcement officer raising a tart-tongued 8-year-old daughter, ABC executives greenlighted the Now What? pilot in December 2003. Morris has spent this year writing and acting in the show's first 13 episodes. ""I don't think folks realize what goes into producing a sitcom,"" Morris said. ""I'm used to spending long, hard hours on the road, honing my material. But I really poured my heart and soul into this show. I feel like I've been given this incredible chance to grow artistically and comedically. Things are finally turning around for me."" ABC primetime entertainment president Stephen McPherson said he's ""glad the network helped [Warren] out."" ""[Warren] seems really great,"" McPherson said. ""Now, the show is a different matter. There's no way it'll make it to November sweeps, much less February. I figure we'll run the first episode and get marginal numbers in the overnights. Then, after the figures drop in the second and third weeks, we'll put it on indefinite hiatus and burn off the leftover episodes during summer. It may seem odd to order 13 episodes when we'll probably air fewer than six, but [Warren]'s a decent guy. He deserves a break."" Scudder said that, even though its run will be brief, the sitcom will help Morris' career. ""Warren will have to go back to stand-up, but he'll get to play slightly better venues,"" Scudder said. ""Maybe he'll even go on Best Week Ever a few times, or get one-time appearances on other sitcoms. At least he'll be known as 'that comedian who used to have his own show.' That's a lot better than not being known at all."" Added Scudder: ""If nothing else, the show put some rent money in Warren's pocket and secured him an entry on the Internet Movie Database."" Now What? will make its debut on ABC on Sept. 15 at 8:30 p.m. EST. Two weeks later, it will move to Tuesdays at 9, before moving to Saturdays at 9:30.

3402,"Dolph Lundgren Wins Long, Courageous Battle Against Fame","NEW YORK'In 1983, the future looked bright for Hans Lundgren. A native of Stockholm, Sweden, Lundgren had already schooled at the Royal Institute of Technology, attended Washington State University on an academic scholarship, and completed his masters degree in Chemical Engineering at the University of Sydney in Australia. Then, the young scientist was awarded the prestigious Fullbright Scholarship to MIT. But it was while he was on his way to Boston to continue his studies that the burgeoning scientist's life took a fateful turn'one that would leave Lundgren fighting for a normal existence for the next 20 years. While working at the trendy Limelight Disco in New York, he met noted drama coach Warren Robertson, who spotted in Lundgren the early signs of fame. ""[Lundgren] was stunned by the diagnosis; he thought he was too young and emotionally healthy to be an actor,"" said Michael Portnoy, Lundgren's manager. ""People with so much intellectual potential never think something like stardom can happen to them. But he was a 6'6"" karate champ with striking blond hair'an IQ of 160 meant nothing."" In 1985, Lundgren made his feature-film debut in the James Bond movie A View To A Kill. ""It all happened so suddenly,"" Portnoy said. ""He got Venz in A View To A Kill. Then he was informed he had the role of Ivan Drago, Sylvester Stallone's opponent in Rocky IV. "" Following the major breakout of his catch phrase from Rocky IV, ""I must break you,"" Lundgren couldn't deny it any longer: Hans, now rechristened Dolph, had fame. ""Dolph thought he had it under control,"" longtime friend and fellow fame survivor Chazz Palminteri said. ""Maybe it was because so many people close to him were similarly afflicted'his girlfriend Grace JonesEE fellow non-native English speaker Arnold Schwarzenegger.""It didn't help that the public never understood the complications of his fame,"" Palminteri said. ""People all over were walking around, saying his lines, styling their hair like Dolph's looked after going through months of shooting Rocky. They didn't care that a normal life was at stake."" After a year away from the box office, Lundgren's symptoms went into remission. However, his condition flared up unexpectedly, when he got Red Scorpion, The Punisher, and, most seriously, Masters Of The Universe. After this, it seemed that Lundgren's fame would overtake his life. His condition was so severe that people stared at him on the street. He could rarely leave the house without the help of an entourage. ""But even at the height of it, Lundgren refused to stop fighting,"" Palminteri said. ""Finally, he made some very important choices about his life, and as a direct result, things began to turn around."" Palminteri was likely referring to the rumors of Lundgren's mid-'90s participation in a controversial Hollywood treatment'it is said that, in the hope of preventing the further spread of fame, Lundgren took massive doses of B-movies. According to Palminteri, Lundgren's part in Universal Soldier brought his fame into remission. The pairing of Lundgren with another heavily accented actor, Jean-Claude Van Damme, was enough to crush his case of fame head on. ""It was a risky treatment,"" Portnoy said. ""Stallone tried a similar one, but to this day, he suffers from residual fame. In Lundgren's case, though, it seemed to work. People wanted to see a vulnerability in their action stars, but Dolph stayed strong and fought this trend. Had Lundgren lacked the courage to suffer through roles like Maj. Jack Holloway in Storm Catcher, he might be famous today."" Lundgren continued to act in films, but by 1997, when he appeared opposite Michael Sarrazin in the action thriller The Peacekeeper, his fame was fully under control.Though Lundgren has appeared in 11 films since then, most people would be hard-pressed to name one of them. ""By using prescription sunglasses and a hat, Mr. Lundgren is now able to live a normal life,"" Portnoy said. ""At most, he may be recognized as 'that Russian guy.' There's always the danger of a relapse'for instance, if a new generation forms a kitsch appreciation for his body of work, or if he carelessly slips into a series of smaller roles of a high caliber. But, given that he's just completed his directorial debut with a film called The Defender'in which he co-stars with Jerry Springer'I don't see that as a concern for the near future.""""

3406,"Where Are You Now, When We Need You Most, Rage Against The Machine?","For nearly 10 years, Rage Against The Machine provided a voice for the disaffected, the disenfranchised, and the angry. Blending punk, pop, hip-hop, metal, and thrash, their music fought corporate America, cultural imperialism, and government oppression head on during a time when most of America was lulled into a Clinton-induced torpor. When Rage Against The Machine's cry for justice was amplified by a major-label debut in 1992, hundreds of thousands of American youths turned to them for guidance. Over the course of eight years, Rage released three original albums and one covers album, each a new and varied challenge, a 60-minute call to arms, a soul cry for the low and lost. But then, in October of 2000, the unthinkable happened: Singer Zack De La Rocha left the band. On that fateful election night in November, there was no one to articulate the outrage and denounce the Supreme Cult's appointment of George W. Shrub to Commander-In-Thief. Where were you then, Rage Against The Machine? Where are you now? Every album you released was a Declaration Of Independence for music fans no longer content with music that served only to entertain. Hearing the teeth-grinding post-metal riffs of ""Sleep Now In The Fire,"" thousands awoke from MTV and Top 40 radio's 24-7 ""pop-ulum somnalocasts."" Every song, every lyric furthered your message. Your words about the war for oil in the Middle East were prophetic. You were an inspiration! What happened? Now, of all times, we look to you for clear-eyed articulation of the fucked-up world we live in. The people of the sun still labor in Mexico, but no one plays bass about their struggles! Mumia sits in prison, yet no one sings for his freedom. What do we hear? Silence. You've abandoned us in our hour of need. How could you? Everywhere: exploitation. Where's the rock? You summed it up so clearly in ""Fistful Of Steel"" when you sang, ""If the vibe was suicide, then you would push da button, but if you're bowin' down, then let me do the cuttin'."" You lifted the nation's youth up out of the mire and taught us to question, to act. Rage Against The Machine, come back. Bring us more slamming riffs and sonic wallop. Bring us more shredding and axing. Do that thing where you make your guitar sound like bagpipes. Seriously, we need a healthy dose of your cuttin', or Bush will win. It's Vietnow, man, and just like you said before, America's getting its news-trients from the likes of Benito Hannity and Adolf Limbaugh. We need a musical antidote to the poison. This nation needs another bomb track to ignite it! We are lost, Rage Against The Machine. Where have you gone? The voice of the voiceless is silent. Surely Zack has ample material for new songs. This empire couldn't be any more evil. What about Abu Ghraib? If ever anyone was sleeping in the fire, it was those prisoners. Zack, if you're listening, if you're reading this'we need you. And where are you, Tom, Tim, and Brad? You bravely stood up for the dispossessed of the Third World, but in the current political climate, we are dispossessed in our own country. The erosion of our rights and liberties makes captives of us all. Do you no longer care? Did the machine defeat you? I'm sorry. I got carried away. It's only my fear for the future that led me to question you. For if not you, then who will rage for us? Audioslave? They're only three-fourths of Rage Against The Machine, and you know it. Besides, they broke up. Limp Bizkit? Slipknot? They have the infectious energy, but aren't so vocal about saving the world from Dick Chicanery and Donald Grab-The-Money-And-Rumsfeld. Only one band has the power to rage against the machine, and that is Rage Against The Machine. If you have any sort of a conscience, you will heed my call.","opinion, entertainment, music, commentary, vol 40 issue 32, jacob ainsworth, entertainment"
3407,Movie Praised For Not Being As Bad As It Could Have Been,"BURBANK, CA'Moviegoers coast to coast hailed Catwoman, the new action film starring Halle Berry, as not as much of an unforgivably awful piece of formulaic commercial pabulum as it could have been. ""You know, I have to hand it to Warner Bros.,"" Miami resident Tom Peebles said Monday. ""Catwoman was terrible, but it actually had one or two decent parts. I really have to say: It could have been a lot worse!"" Catwoman, loosely based on the DC Comics character, has similarly shattered other viewers' bottom-of-the-barrel expectations, offering a small number of redeeming features instead of the expected none. ""That one part where the woman pushes Catwoman off a balcony to demonstrate that she can land on her feet was sort of cool, I guess,"" said Bangor, ME's Sally Burrows. ""And it was kind of funny when she ate, like, 10 cans of tuna in a row. Oh, and when she drank that glass of cream at the bar'that was, though not exactly funny, at least funny-ish. My kids seemed to like it. Well, Mindy, at least."" ""Mindy just turned 7,"" Burrows added. According to Ivan Berger, a self-described film buff, Catwoman trailers'featuring atrocious computer-generated animation, cringe-worthy shots of Berry snapping a whip to intolerable R&B music, and love interest/cop sidekick Benjamin Bratt's flirtatious mugging'set audience expectations very low. ""At first glance, Catwoman, the story of a sexy feline superhero who fights villains in the cosmetics industry, seemed like the kind of formulaic, committee-written marketing opportunity'Garfield, New York Minute, and so on'that has become the summer-movie standard,"" Berger said. ""To everyone's surprise, Catwoman proved marginally better than that."" ""Judging from the ads, I assumed I'd want my eight bucks back,"" Berger added. ""But after seeing the movie, I was pleasantly surprised to find I only wanted three, maybe four bucks back, tops."" A half-realized camp attitude, which suggested that the filmmakers were aware of the film's poor quality, impressed viewers, as well. ""After seeing a billboard with Halle Berry vamping around in that ridiculous outfit, I really thought I'd have to leave midway through,"" Los Angeles resident Brian Gunderson said. ""But you know what? Some of the action scenes were halfway non-shitty. Definitely curb'as opposed to gutter'level. Also, I found myself paying attention to the character development once or twice. I guess I underestimated it. I'd say it actually merits one and a half stars."" Critics joined moviegoers to applaud Catwoman for not having been worse. Tom Dickinson of WHO-TV in Des Moines called Catwoman a movie that ""doesn't exactly roar, but does kind of purr at times, I guess."" Ellen Norbury of Hollywood Reviews Online said, ""It's a better-than-failed effort, sure to provide two or three halfway-fun moments."" Some industry insiders hope the film signals an end to the ""worst-possible"" trend in motion pictures. ""Catwoman bucks the trend established by such recent blockbusters as Troy and Van Helsing, which met audience predictions head-on by being exactly as bad as they seemed like they would be,"" media analyst Roy Oglive said. ""It's possible that Catwoman will increase audience expectations, making them judge subsequent releases by a harsher standard. The American viewing public may actually come to expect movies not to be totally horrible."" Unfortunately, Oglive said, that may prove to be both a blessing and a curse. ""If moviegoers forget to keep their expectations low, the occasional almost-okay moments in Catwoman will lead to further disappointments down the road,"" Oglive said. ""When the next League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen comes along, they'll be devastated."" In the meantime, moviegoers are relishing the experience of a night out at the movies that they don't completely hate. ""It's so refreshing to take the family out to what you assume will be the absolute worst movie of the year, and then find out it's only among the year's worst movies,"" said Janice Davenport, 27, of Jeffersontown, KY. ""Catwoman is the kind of once-in-a-blue-moon summer blockbuster that makes going to the movies slightly less non-fun again.""","entertainment, movies, news, vol 40 issue 31, entertainment"
3408,"Kickboxer, Starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, To Continue In A Moment","ATLANTA'Kickboxer, starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, will resume after a brief pause, TNT sources reported several seconds ago. ""Kickboxer, starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, will continue in a moment,"" an unidentified network source said. According to the anonymous male source, the interruption to the Kickboxer broadcast will be brief. The representative for TNT asked that all persons watching Kickboxer, the 1989 action movie starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, ""[remain] tuned to TNT."" The interruption affects viewers nationwide. ""[Van Damme's character] Kurt Sloan had just seen his brother, a U.S. kickboxing champion, suffer a brutal beating at the hands of the sadistic Tong Po,"" Phoenix-area TNT viewer Charles de Bernier said. ""Van Damme's brother was paralyzed, but Tong Po was remorseless'in fact, he was almost gloating. But before anything else big happened, the movie was interrupted."" De Bernier said the disruption, which followed a freeze-frame of Van Damme's bloody and shame-ridden face, did not worry him. ""I expect that Kickboxer will continue in a moment,"" de Bernier said. De Bernier's roommate Kyle Hammond was unavailable for comment, having chosen to spend the broadcast interruption in the bathroom. Boston viewer Garret Corbin, standing in front of his open refrigerator and pouring himself a glass of grape juice, is one of tens of thousands of viewers awaiting the movie's return. ""If the movie continues, I think Van Damme's character will take vengeance on Tong Po'provided he can find someone to train him,"" Corbin said, basing his hypothesis on two weeks of TNT pronouncements that ""Jean-Claude Van Damme isEE Kickboxer.""orbin said he believes that Kickboxer, starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, ""will come back on any minute now."" ""If I'm going to take their word for it that Van Damme will assume the titular role,"" Corbin said, ""then I might as well take their claim that Kickboxer will continue at face value."" ""I'll have to see, though,"" Corbin added, fumbling with a bag of pretzels. Robert Thompson, director of the Center for the Study of Popular Television at Syracuse University, said that, during this or a future interruption, viewers are likely to hear an announcement concerning TNT programming scheduled for later in the day. ""Oh, something like, 'Thelma & Louise, an edited-for-television feature starring Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis, contains adult situations and graphic violence,'"" Thompson said. ""Whatever it is, I expect the American public to remain calm during the brief interruption of Kickboxer, as frequent disruptions are a normal part of the basic-cable viewing experience. Take Jean-Claude Van Damme's movies alone: We've seen Bloodsport, Universal Soldier, and even Timecop interrupted. In every case, the network, whether it was AMC, TBS, or Spike, has always made good on its promise."" ""Oh, hey!"" Thompson said.

3411,Bill Maher Spends All Night Arguing With Republican Hooker,"LOS ANGELES'Sources close to Bill Maher report that the comedian and host of HBO's Real Time With Bill Maher spent Friday evening arguing with Carolyn Dobson, a prostitute from the London Escorts Agency and a supporter of the Republican Party. Dobson and Maher, who occupied an executive suite at the W Hotel, reportedly argued on subjects ranging from the Bush Administration's financial accounting for the Iraq war to its refusal to release records to the public in accordance with the Freedom Of Information Act. The two also engaged in three consensual sex acts, for which the comedian paid $750. Maher, who was nominated for an Emmy Award in 2001 for his work on ABC's Politically Incorrect, made his first political observation early in the evening. Shortly after entering the hotel room, he turned his attention from Dobson, who was unpacking her bag, to the television screen, where CNN commentator Eleanor Clift appeared on The McLaughlin Group. Sitting on the edge of the bed and watching the television as he removed his shoes, Maher asked about Dobson's political affiliation. Dobson responded that she did not vote in the last election, but if she had, she would have supported Bush. ""Let me tell you something about Bush's domestic agenda, Carolyn,"" Maher said. ""He doesn't have one. I mean, take a look at his State Of The Union address. Sports coaches need to crack down on athletes' use of steroids? I'm sorry, that's not a vision for America's future. That's a Sports Illustrated op-ed topic."" Dobson said she didn't initially attempt to argue with the winner of four Cable Ace Awards. ""I was getting all my condoms and lubricants and stuff out,"" Dobson said. ""I told him straight sex was $250 and asked him to pick what I should wear. He chose the pink negligee."" While the prostitute phoned Maher's credit-card number into her agency, the quick-witted pundit returned his attention to the television screen, where a news segment showed Bush addressing military personnel at CENTCOM headquarters in Tampa, FL. ""Bush was thanking the soldiers for protecting America, and [Maher] was like, 'They'd better soak up his thanks now, Carolyn, because'' something about how Bush is gonna cut their healthcare,"" Dobson said. ""I was like, 'I'm surprised you don't like Bush, because most successful guys do.' He was like, 'Okay, new rule: No more choosing political parties the way we choose the homecoming court.'"" Added Dobson: ""Then he asked me to put my face up next to his dick while he jerked off."" According to Dobson, during the approximately 40 minutes of copulation, the comedian restricted his comments to requests for changes of position or velocity. After ejaculation, however, he introduced the topic of John Kerry's election platform. ""Two weeks ago, Kerry said that preventing nuclear terrorism would be his highest priority as president,"" Maher said, a rivulet of semen trickling down his right leg. ""Given that statement, you'd expect Kerry to have a broad, ambitious agenda on nuclear non-proliferation, wouldn't you? Well, I'm sorry, Carolyn, but you'd be 100 percent wrong."" Added Maher: ""Interesting, isn't it, that not one American president has made the halt of our nuclear-weapons program a priority?"" When Dobson informed Maher that it would be $500 more if she stayed the evening, Maher agreed to the fee, and reportedly continued to introduce various topical discussions, at one point lifting Dobson's head from between his legs to ask a pointed question. ""He was like, 'How can a whore support an administration that legislates against her own livelihood?"" Dobson said. ""And I was like, 'Don't call me a whore.'"" Maher did not limit the debate to politics, introducing hot-button issues ranging from space tourism to dead otters to the Supreme Court ruling on HMOs, and even riffing for several minutes on ""so-called independently funded drug studies."" Dobson admitted that the author of Does Anybody Have A Problem With That? Politically Incorrect's Greatest Hits did ultimately goad her into a debate. ""I said I heard that Bush created a lot of jobs lately,"" Dobson said. ""He rolled off of me and got up on his knees and was like, 'Created jobs? Honey, tell me, if you don't mind, what exactly Bush has done to create jobs. Do you mean jobs in Mexico and India?' I was like, 'I just know there are more jobs.' He was like, 'Yeah, I know a lot of Halliburton execs who agree with you.'"" ""His stomach has this weird scar on it,"" Dobson added.","entertainment, politics, celebrities, sex, news, vol 40 issue 28, entertainment"

3415,Jeff Gordon Never Gets Tired Of Seeing Face On Cheap Plastic Crap,"CHARLOTTE, NC'NASCAR driver Jeff Gordon never tires of seeing his image on cheap, collectible junk, the four-time Winston Cup champion revealed Monday during a visit to the Hendrick Motorsports racing complex gift shop. ""Well, look at that!"" Gordon said, grinning as he examined an illuminated license-plate frame bearing his likeness, signature, and yellow number 24. ""That there's a real nice piece of tackle. I'll bet you could put one of my collectible laser-cut license plates in there and display it in your house. That'd look good next to your Jeff Gordon Collectible Shot Glass or your set of diecast #24 cars. Get a second one for your car, to match your Jeff Gordon Floormats and Jeff Gordon DuPont Racing Keychain, and you'll be good to go."" ""Hey!"" Gordon added, repeatedly pressing a button bearing a ""Try Me"" sticker. ""I light up. Ain't that something else?"" Gordon, who became the youngest Daytona 500 winner in 1997, has enjoyed a 10-year career at the highest level of American auto racing. The 32-year-old's multiple championships and 66 race victories have garnered him more than $60 million in winnings, and he earns millions of dollars in additional income each year through the sale of gewgaws like belt buckles, rings, knives, lunchboxes, dog collars, watches, bedding sets, and cigarette lighters with his face on them. ""The other day, I was at a Kmart and came across the Jeff Gordon Stained Glass Bar Lamp,"" Gordon said. ""It was a lamp with me on it. Can you believe it? That gave me such a kick."" The Jeff Gordon Can Cozie, the Jeff Gordon #24 TrackSider Flip-Flops, and the Jeff Gordon Home Collection Wallpaper Border are just a few of the items that fans, and Gordon himself, can't get enough of. ""The other day, I even saw me-pajamas,"" Gordon said. Gordon's manager, Forrest Logan, commented on the racecar driver's enthusiasm. ""There ain't too many things Jeff enjoys as much as racing,"" Logan said. ""There's winning, of course. There are his fans'they're the best in the world. And then there's strolling through the aisles at Wal-Mart and seeing his face on everything from here to Sunday, like the Jeff Gordon 8-piece BBQ Set, the Jeff Gordon Edition Tire Valve Caps, and, for the ladies, the Jeff Gordon DuPont Racing #24 Clutch."" ""That's a little purse with Jeff on the side,"" Logan added. Gordon's many commercial endorsements'with corporations ranging from Coke to Kellogg's'further increase the amount of tacky garbage bearing his face. ""Yup, seems as though I can't buy a hoagie without some kid handing me a cup that's got me and my car on it,"" Gordon said. ""I don't mind one bit, though. I love to sit back and sip on a Coke and look at that car. It's a great car, ain't it?"" Gordon crew chief Robbie Loomis, who gets his Jeff Gordon useless garbage free, said he has grown accustomed to seeing pictures of Gordon on most of his possessions. ""I appreciate all of the duffel bags and whatnot,"" Loomis said. ""And check out the big ol' mustache Jeff's got on my souvenir mug. I always liked that mustache on him. You know, I think he'd sell a lot more Jeff Gordon 18-Can Cooler Bags if he was sporting a mustache on them, too. I tell you."" Exiting the store and heading back to the pit, Gordon seemed determined not to let his success, his fame, or the fact that millions of tacky so-called collectibles bear his image go to his head. ""Fans of stockcar racing are a real down-home group,"" Gordon said, adjusting his Official Father's Day Edition Jeff Gordon/Hendrick Motorsports Pit Crew Hat. ""They wouldn't forgive me if I got a big head. Once in a while, I can authorize a Jeff Gordon Ranger 519DX Bass Boat, or put together a Jeff Gordon-Escort Travel Luxury Tour Of The Holy Land. But they'll think I'm getting too big for my britches if I don't mainly stick to affordable stuff like the Jeff Gordon Teddy Bear In Racing Suit and the Jeff Gordon Candle Set."" ""People never seem to get tired of seeing my name and number on stuff,"" Gordon said, absent-mindedly cleaning his Jeff Gordon Foster Grant Sunglasses on the sleeve of his Jeff Gordon Cotton-Twill Team Jacket. ""And you know what? Neither do I.""","entertainment, celebrities, products, athletes, nascar, news, vol 40 issue 25, entertainment"
3416,"Hey, Isn't That The Pot That's On TV?","Does that pot over there look familiar to you? Over there, in Aisle 7, across from the deodorants? I know I've seen that box before. Was it in the Twin Lakes Walgreens? No, that's not where it was. Hmm, where have I seen that'holy shit! That's the pot that's on TV! What the hell is the name of it? Damn, it's on the tip of my tongue. Pasta Pot? No. Pasta Premiere? NoEE Pasta Pro! That's it! That's the Pasta Pro! Don't look at it! Be cool. You know the pot'from that late-night commercial? Remember? ""sta Pro is as easy as 1-2-3!"" It's the one where you just place your favorite pasta into the Pasta Pro and, when the pasta's ready, turn the lid to the locked position, pour the water out, and keep the pasta in! Pasta Pro! C'mon, I'm sure you've seen the commercial. Well, you'd know it if you watched the midnight reruns of Roseanne on Channel 14. That pot's totally famous. Do you think we should see if we can get our picture taken with it? Man, I wonder what the hell the Pasta Pro is doing all the way out here in Litchfield. And why's it in a pharmacy? Shouldn't it be in California on the set of another commercial or something? You'd think it'd have something else lined up by now. Come to think of it, I've been seeing repeats of the same commercial for a while now. I hope the pot's doing okay. Don't stare at it. That's totally rude. This is really exciting. My mom's going to flip out when we tell her we saw that pot. Whenever that commercial comes on, she says how much she likes it. My dad can never understand why she has a thing for it. Hey, wait here. I'm going to go to the shampoo aisle and walk around so I can get a better look at it. Don't worry. I'll be casual. It doesn't know that we know what it is. Do you have your digital camera? Don't get it out yet. Just hold on. Let me go over there. Let me be 100 percent sure that it's the same pot. Okay, now I'm positive that's the pot from TV. The whole Pasta Pro posse is sitting there with it. You know'the durable pasta fork, the hand-held cheese grater, the Pasta Pro recipe guide, and the additional two-quart Pasta Pro. I am so freaking out! Should we go over there? I don't know. That just seems kinda weird. I'm sure that the pot is used to being noticed, but I'm not sure if we should try to pick it up. Maybe we should just leave it alone and let it do its thing. I'm not one of those losers that fawns over a kitchen appliance just because it's been on TV. I mean, if it were the Ronco Electric Food Dehydrator, I wouldn't care at all. Tell you what, we'll go and get that toothbrush and everything else that you need. If it's still over in that aisle, we'll go over. Who knows, maybe it needs a little help finding something to do here in Litchfield. Not like there's a whole lot to do in this shithole town. Yeah, I know you've seen the Chia Pet at the Spencer Gifts over in Round Lake. Who cares? The Chia Pet is washed up, man. It's so 15 years ago. It's just sad at this point. Its box is all faded and dusty. Even when it was new, it was dumb. I never understood why it was so popular. And then, every time there's a decent TV product, like the Liquid Leather repair kit or Pops-A-Dent, it seems to just fall off the face of the earth. I guess Mr. and Mrs. Joe Lunchpail don't know how to respond to a product that's actually innovative or useful. I hope that doesn't happen to the Pasta Pro. It totally has so much potential. The Pasta Pro's lightweight design fits any stovetop and can be used to create an endless variety of your favorite dishes. Hey, remember this line? ""You can quickly prepare delicious macaroni and cheese, linguini with clam sauce, or even brown sirloin beef for chili, without the mess."" That's my favorite. Okay, okay. I know I'm acting like a nerd. Let's just go get your toothbrush and then we'll go over there, really quick, and not make a big deal about it. This is going to be awesome. I can't wait to tell all my friends.ee","opinion, entertainment, products, television, shopping, commentary, vol 40 issue 24, jerry milobritch, entertainment"
3417,J.K. Rowling Ends Harry Potter Series After Discovering Boys,"EDINBURGH, SCOTLAND'Speaking though her publicist, author J.K. Rowling shocked fans and the publishing world Monday when she announced that she has opted to end the best-selling Harry Potter series because she has discovered boys. ""For many years, writing the Harry Potter books was the most important thing in Joanne's life,"" said publicist Mark Knowles, who is ""just good friends"" with Rowling. ""She's been experiencing a lot of changes lately. She still wants to keep in touch with her fans, but she doesn't feel she can sit in a room at her computer all day while there are so many cute boys running around."" According to Knowles, instead of working on the as-yet-untitled sixth installment in her series, Rowling has spent the past two months sunning herself at the beach, reading fashion magazines, and talking on the phone for hours. ""I know many of you are upset by this news,"" Knowles said. ""But Ms. Rowling was tired of devoting herself to something that no longer held her interest'namely, writing books about wizards, flying broomsticks, and candy that jumps. She's a lot older than she was when she wrote the first book. She'd much rather be going to the mall, looking for cute outfits, and talking to the boy with the curly red hair who works at the Hot Sam pretzel shop."" Friends of Rowling say her increasing interest in boys first became obvious during the 2003 release of her series' fifth installment, Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix. At book signings, Rowling often had her longtime friend Mindy Harrison pass notes to cute boys in line. But according to Harrison, the author would blush and be unable to speak whenever one approached her. In fact, sources say delays on Phoenix stemmed from Rowling's unrequited infatuation with Randy Powell, winner of the PEN Center USA West Award for Children's Literature and author of Run If You Dare and Tribute To Another Dead Rock Star. ""She had such a big crush on him, it was crazy,"" Harrison said. ""She'd call his house and hang up. She'd draw pictures for him, but never send them. If she wasn't looking him up online, she was talking about him endlessly. She finally got the courage to e-mail him, but he never responded. I don't think I've ever seen her so depressed. The only reason she finished Order Of The Phoenix was because she knew it would outsell all his books put together."" Many of Rowling's fans disapprove of the author's decision to quit writing the Harry Potter series. Some here also complained about the amount of makeup Rowling has begun to wear, her choice of friends, and her recent decision to get her belly button pierced. ""I can't believe she would give up something she worked so hard on, just because people might think it's not 'cool,'"" said Nancy Listrom, a Boston resident and fan of the Harry Potter books. ""I blame that Mindy girl. She's a bad influence."" Added Listrom: ""And I can't believe her publicist allows her to show up at a bookstore appearance dressed in that pink skirt. It barely covers her butt. Her writing is a better way to get attention."" Philadelphia fan Jack Powell said discipline is the solution. ""If it were up to me, I'd ground her until she finished the series,"" Powell said. ""If we let her quit now, what kind of message does that send?"" It seems unlikely that fans' comments will do anything to reverse Rowling's decision. Last week, the author said she can't believe how ""immature"" her novels are. ""When I look back at these books, I am, like, humiliated that anyone read them,"" Rowling said in a June 12 article in the London Times. ""I wish they would all just go away. Whenever I meet a boy that I like, someone always shows him my books and makes a big deal about how they're the best-selling books in the world. It's so embarrassing."" Knowles reassured fans that Rowling is ""probably just going through a phase."" ""Ms. Rowling loves writing, but she's just a little boy crazy,"" Knowles said. ""Like any 39-year-old woman, her hormones are raging. Right now, all she wants to do is go to parties and daydream about her wedding, but that won't last more than a few years. Watch what happens after her first big breakup.""","entertainment, kids, sex, books, harry potter, news, vol 40 issue 24, entertainment"

3419,Suicide Letter Full Of Simpsons References,"STORRS, CT'University of Connecticut sophomore Aaron Bennett, 20, was found dead of an apparent sleeping-pill overdose in his campus-area apartment Saturday, a suicide note riddled with references to the popular TV show The Simpsons on his desk. ""Outwardly, Aaron seemed like a gentle, quiet, stable person,"" dean of students Kathleen Ernst said Monday. ""But clearly, he must have had a darker, troubled side that he kept hidden. The only thing we can be certain of is that, to the very end, he really knew his Simpsons."" Friends and family are struggling to comprehend the dean's-list chemistry major's motivation for taking his own life, as outlined in the three-page suicide letter. ""When death comes so suddenly, it can seem incomprehensible,"" Ernst said. ""It certainly doesn't help matters that Aaron's note begins, 'No banging your head on the display case, please. It contains a very rare Mary Worth in which she has advised a friend to commit suicide.' How do you even begin to explain something like that to his parents?"" Bennett's cousin, Tracy Hogg, said she did not know that the young man was despondent, but did know that he was a big Simpsons fan. ""Aaron had loved The Simpsons since he was little,"" Hogg said. ""He found so much joy in the show. He had nearly every episode memorized word-for-word. You'd think there'd be no reason for someone like him to take his own life."" The three-page note, headed with the inscription ""Dumb Things I Gotta Do Today,"" includes references to plotlines from dozens of the more than 300 episodes of the animated series. Bennett quotes Simpsons mainstays like Bart Simpson and Ned Flanders, as well as relatively obscure characters, such as Lyle Lanley, Disco Stu, and Very Tall Man. ""Today, part four of our series on the agonizing pain in which I live every day,"" Bennett's note read. ""Or should I say part 400? Not even drinking age yet and I'm tired, people. For me, life is like an escalator to nowhere. Well, this is where I jump off."" Storrs Police Department detective Roger Mann said the note is so dense with references that the investigators, most of them only casually acquainted with the show, have had difficulty distinguishing Bennett's original thoughts from the many Simpsons-derived expressions. ""It will take some time to fully understand Aaron's letter,"" Mann said. ""For example, he talks about banishing himself to the land of wind and ghosts, a remark that struck me as particularly haunting and despairing. But later, someone told me the line comes from a Simpsons lampoon of a Japanese TV commercial."" Some of the quotes in the letter contain no clear allusion to Bennett's impending death or despondency. ""On page three, the letter says, 'Can you open my milk, Mommy?''a line with no apparent suicidal meaning,"" Mann said. ""But then, you don't know. When he quoted Simpsons character Ralph Wiggum, Aaron might have been lamenting his lack of independence or pining for his lost childhood. But I'm willing to bet that he just thought that line was funny."" Continued Mann: ""I believe this may also be the case with 'Diagnosis: delicious.'"" Magnus Whittaker, Bennett's friend since junior high and a fellow Simpsons enthusiast, said he corresponded with Bennett regularly until about four months ago, when Bennett mysteriously stopped e-mailing him. Whittaker described his friend as a kind but withdrawn young man whose favorite mode of communication was the quoting of Simpsons lines. Whittaker said that, in in a phone conversation weeks prior to his death, Bennett was unusually candid about his unhappiness. ""Aaron likened himself to Frank Grimes,"" Whittaker said, referring to the hard-working Springfield Nuclear Power Plant employee. ""He resented that no one paid attention to him, and he complained that no one seemed to appreciate his hard work. Once, when we were IM-ing each other, he said he sometimes wished he would electrocute himself, like Frank Grimes did. I was like, 'Holy flurking schnit.'"" In spite of the warning, Whittaker said he was shocked when Bennett took his own life. ""I am absolutely stunned Aaron was capable of killing himself,"" Whittaker said. ""I was even more bowled over by his note. I mean, that 'I ate too much plastic candy' line was so cool. I actually had to look that one up."" As those who knew Bennett continue to decipher his final thoughts, Ernst urged any students who might feel depressed to seek treatment. ""You may feel unloved, misunderstood, or stressed, but all people experience those feelings at one time or another,"" Ernst said. ""I want everyone to know that help is available from a variety of sources, on and off campus. It's so tragic to see someone so young give up and say, 'Oh, I've wasted my life.' It's just such a shame that Aaron felt his was the worst existence'ever."" ""Jeez, now I'm doing it,"" Ernst added.","entertainment, human interest, death, tv, television, news, vol 40 issue 23, entertainment"
3420,Ex-Nickelodeon Stars Relate Horrors Of Green Slime Syndrome,"OTTAWA'Veterans of the '80s cult classic TV show You Can't Do That On Television filed a $1 billion class-action lawsuit against Nickelodeon Monday, alleging that the network exposed them to a bevy of toxins which led to a chronic affliction called Green Slime Syndrome. ""The producers assured us the slime was safe, and that getting drenched with it for five or more takes wouldn't cause any lasting damage,"" cast member Alasdair Gillis said. ""I was only 12. I didn't ask questions; I just did what the director said. Now I live with constant pain."" Gillis then pulled up his sleeves to reveal the suppurating pustules that cover his forearms and wrists. ""Most days I just sit on the couch and relive the shows,"" Gillis said. ""It's inexcusable that the directors punished me for having the courage to say 'I don't know.'"" You Can't Do That On Television, a Canadian children's sketch-comedy show, aired on Nickelodeon from 1979 to 1990, with a cast largely made up of local amateur child actors. Many sketches were punctuated with physical humor, with the actors frequently doused in slime, water, or foodstuffs. Since YCDTOTV ended production, as many as 50 cast members have complained of a host of symptoms, including chronic pain and fatigue, numbness in the extremities, skin rashes, headache, nausea, and depression. Gillis said he personally was doused with four different colors of slime, as well as spaghetti sauce, ink, mud, motor oil, soup, and silly string'all within the span of one season. ""If you tell people you have GSS, they act like you're just a coddled child actor,"" Gillis added. ""'Part of the harsh reality of show-biz,' they say. But they don't know what it was like, man. Now, 20 years later, I still wince every time I hear someone say 'water.' I still request Evian in restaurants. I can't even be in the same room as a cream pie."" Gillis said cast members didn't file the lawsuit sooner because it took years for their doctors to make the connection between the mysterious ailments and the slime to which victims were exposed during the show. ""I left the show in 1986, and about a year later, I got a rash all over my face that just wouldn't go away,"" Gillis said. ""Then I started having debilitating migraines and shooting pains in my back. It was when my fingers went numb that I knew something had to be wrong. I bounced from doctor to doctor, until a physician in Beverly Hills sat me down and asked me if I'd ever been exposed to comic props. Finally, I knew it wasn't all in my head. I knew it was the slime."" Cast member Marjorie Silcoff said she silently suffered a multitude of painful symptoms for years, until she attended a 1999 YCDTOTV reunion and discovered that many of her co-stars were suffering from similar unexplained ailments. ""When Les Lye [who played popular characters Barth, Ross, Senator Prevort, and El Capitano on the show] walked in with the left side of his face paralyzed, I started crying,"" Silcoff said. ""I had a flashback to Barth standing there in the order window beneath the fly paper, holding up his spatula, getting slimed. It was so tragic. He never even had a chance to say his line, ""That's what's in the burgers.'"" Continued Silcoff: ""We all just stood on the mark like we were told. Christ, when you think about all the things that we were exposed to'mustard, milk, Jell-O, grape soda'it's incredible that we survived at all."" According to Silcoff, Nickelodeon lawyers continue to claim that GSS is just a stress-related ailment or a form of psychological hysteria. ""They tell our doctors, 'Don't encourage them,'"" Silcoff said. ""Some of us gave it our all for 11 years, but that doesn't mean a thing to them. They wish we'd just disappear."" Christine ""Moose"" McGlade, who hosted the show from the first season until 1986, said the cast members' inexperience made them willing to expose themselves to danger. ""We were all so young and gung-ho,"" McGlade said. ""We thought we'd better do our job if we didn't want the troupe as a whole to suffer. When you're on set, the cast is your family. Once you've been in a food fight with someone, there's a bond that can never really be broken. It's hard for non-actors to understand what it's like under the hot lights of the studio."" Nickelodeon's official position on GSS, released in a statement Monday, is that there is ""no scientific evidence of a unique pattern of illness that can be causally linked to television service at Nickelodeon."" ""Nickelodeon would never under any circumstances endanger any of its actors, particularly children,"" the statement read. ""The slime was thoroughly tested and deemed safe. While our sympathies are with the ill actors, Nickelodeon is not responsible for their ailments."" Despite Nickelodeon's denial of wrongdoing, the cast members plan to press on with the lawsuit, pursuing compensation for years of pain and suffering, as well as public acknowledgment of the hidden dangers of sliming. ""Nick is still sliming kids on Slimetime Live'and not just paid actors, either,"" Gillis said. ""These are regular kids from the audience who are willing to place themselves in the path of danger for the promise of winning a Game Boy or a box of Hubba Bubba Bubble Tape. Nick even sells the slime commercially, which, frankly, keeps me up at night."" Continued Gillis: ""We're still imploring [former YCDTOTV cast member] Alanis Morissette to come forward. Her support would do a lot to raise awareness of GSS. But would it be enough to erase the suspicion, resistance, and bitterness that has enveloped discussion of this syndrome from the start? I don't know.""","entertainment, health, tv, news, vol 40 issue 21, entertainment"

3427,Why Can't This Family Ever Have A Funky Good Time?,"I say goddamn! It ain't but once or twice a year the Brown clan get together. Every time, we swear up and down it's gonna be a brand new bag.

3431,"Before I Die, I'd Like To See Hazzard County With My Own Eyes","Through the years, as I've traveled this country selling floor coverings, I've had the opportunity to see the best this great nation of ours has to offer: the famous Cheers district of Boston, the historic Flimm building in Cincinnati, and the storied East Side of New York City, to which the Jeffersons made their famous odyssey. Once, while attending a convention in Milwaukee, I was blessed to tread the same streets as Laverne, Shirley, and the immortals of the Happy Days gang. But as I grow older'for, yes, I am getting old'the urban life entices me less, and the winter stays longer in my bones. Lately, I find myself thinking often of the balmy Southern countryside. Though I have seen great wonders in my life, I have yet to see Hazzard County with my own eyes. Ah, fabled Hazzard County! Where life is by turns bucolic and abruptly violent, and inhabitants are as puritanically hard-working as they are prone to committing misdemeanor crimes. How I long to travel its winding roads! What joy, to motor serenely, or less serenely should occasion demand, past the suggestively inclined surfaces of Hazzard'a partially finished bridge over a creek here; there, a hay wagon tilted at an incline just adjacent to a farmhouse; and over yonder, a stack of lumber leaning innocently against an outhouse! How my soul yearns to lose itself in the sporadic rural traffic of Hazzard, with its farm animals, its souped-up American sporting automobiles, and its police cruisers! Truly, no other place is as beautiful a romantic representation of the post-industrial South. My desire to visit Hazzard County is not without reservations. For one thing, I worry that it may be difficult to get there. Although I know it's ""somewheres south of the Mason-Dixon line and east of the Mississip',"" I am somewhat embarrassed to admit that I'm unsure of its exact location inside of Georgia. A part of me is also apprehensive. Hazzard County's magnificence may have diminished, its splendor faded with time. It may now be a shadow of its bumptious past self. I have been saddened thusly before, as when I visited the Santa Monica boardwalk, where Jack Tripper watched Chrissy rollerskate, only to find it clotted with tourist shops. And my heart nearly broke to see the outdoor basketball courts of Mr. Kotter's beloved Brooklyn standing empty. I have learned the hardest way possible that nothing good and pure can remain so. Perhaps not even Hazzard County, where time moves slower than most other places, can escape the ever-turning wheel of Father Time. So much more of my life lies behind me than ahead. If I do not see Hazzard County, how can I count my existence complete? Would mine be a life truly lived if I never saw the infamous Boar's Nest'headquarters of the villainous Boss Hogg and wellspring of many a misadventure'in all its ragged vagabond glory? Could my body be put to rest without its foot having fallen in the purtiest town square in Dixie? Could my soul repose in tranquility without having first experienced Cooter's Garage, where the General Lee was tuned, where Cale Yarborough's top-secret carburetor was returned to its rightful owner, and where President Carter's limo was squirreled away after being stolen in a moment of happy-go-lucky mischief? Could I succumb peacefully to the clutch of death knowing that I had never breathed the air inside the sheriff's office? Never having seen the mill of Hazzard law enforcement grind out justice neither too coarse nor too fine, could I deem mine a life truly lived? No. I must see Hazzard. I must see Hazzard or eternally long to bask in the late June light as it falls on the Duke ancestral farm, where once a motley band of valiant, mysteriously begotten cousins fought to keep their family land safe from foreclosure on an almost weekly basis. Though I have never been there, I know I would be at home. I know I would be welcomed. I know that a part of me, of everyone, belongs there. When I think of experiencing Hazzard County in the flesh, my heart leaps upEE leaps up and soars, as if it had suddenly encountered an inclined woodpile, lovingly arranged at a 45-degree angle by some unknown, benevolent hands, there, waiting on the banks of Possum Creek.","opinion, entertainment, commentary, vol 40 issue 13, ron knutsen, entertainment"

3436,Jesus Demands Creative Control Over Next Movie,"HOLLYWOOD, CA'After watching Mel Gibson's The Passion Of The Christ Monday, Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ announced that He will demand creative control over the next film based on His life. ""I never should have given Mel Gibson so much license,"" said Christ, the Son of God. ""I don't like to criticize a member of the flock, but that close-up of the nails being pounded into My wrists'that was just bad."" Our Lord did not limit His criticisms to Gibson's Passion; He expressed frustration with historical inaccuracies in numerous film adaptations of His life. ""There have been a lot of films based on My life, and pretty much all of them have gotten it wrong,"" Christ said. ""Just look at Godspell'what the heck was going on there? It's time I reclaim My image."" Christ said He considered returning to the physical world to make an accurate film depiction of His life for years, but seeing The Passion prompted Him to finally descend from heaven, meet with His agent Ronald Thatcher, and demand that He be attached as a producer on any future projects. ""Ron has a history of telling Me that the filmmakers 'totally understand' the Word Of God, and that the project is going to be 'fabulous,'"" Christ said. ""But when it comes out, it's all wrong, and Ron claims everything fell apart in post-production. At that point, there's nothing left for Me to do but say, 'Okay, fine. I forgive you all.' Well, next time, I'll be shepherding the project through from casting to final edit to marketing."" Describing one of His biggest complaints, Christ said that no film about His life has ever ""made the apostles pop."" ""In The Greatest Story Ever Told, the 12 are basically interchangeable,"" Christ said. ""Directors get the piety, but they don't bring out the personalities behind the agape love. Some of those guys were real cut-ups, you know. Simon Peter could make you laugh until you cried tears of blood."" In order to bring these and other truths to light, Christ teamed up with screenwriter Ron Bass, who wrote both Snow Falling On Cedars and My Best Friend's Wedding. The two have been co-writing a high-concept script, temporarily called Untitled Jesus Project. ""We're still hammering out the treatment, but I'm really excited about where it's headed,"" Christ said. ""It really beefs up My relationship with John the Baptist, something all of the other movies missed. They always put in the beheading, but they leave out the quiet moments when John and I would hang out, eat locusts and honey, and talk about the redemption of Man. I think our friendship will really resonate with a lot of viewers."" Christ said He is also working on a heist film based loosely on the loaves-and-the-fishes incident, but that the project is currently stuck in development. ""I tend to have problems pitching to studio executives,"" Christ said. ""Last week, I appeared in a vision before a D-girl at Sony, and I said, 'Be not afraid, for I am Jesus'I have written a treatment and Matthew McConaughey is interested in the role of Herod.' Apparently, she was a little freaked-out by the vision and she ended up passing on the idea. Ron said that next time I should just schedule a lunch meeting like everyone else."" Returning to film adaptations about His life and Word, Christ said some inaccuracies can be traced back to the source material, the New Testament. ""Remember, at the time the Good Book was written, I was running around saving souls like a madman,"" Christ said. ""I couldn't focus on a writing project, too. I basically gave My team of writers the broad strokes and hoped inspiration would fill in the cracks. Now, I'm not saying the New Testament isn't good'it is. It's great! But by the time I got around to reading the galleys, the monks had already finished the first printing."" The Lord Jesus did have positive things to say about Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation Of Christ. ""Not only is Marty a fantastic director, but the story isn't the same old, same old,"" Jesus said. ""It's like The Gospel of Mark filtered through an episode of The Twilight Zone. I love it. My one problem is with the casting of Willem Dafoe. He's good, but I think John Turturro would have made a better Me."" In spite of His love for Scorsese, Christ said He has no plans to simply make ""the next Last Temptation."" ""My movie about My life will be the greatest movie ever shown,"" Christ said. ""It should be the last Word on Me. No more animated versions, no more musicals, and no more movies where the scourging scene is so violent, you could put it in Fangoria. I mean, yes, being crucified is very painful. But I can't see devoting more than, say, three minutes of film to it."" Jesus added: ""My version will have it all: drama, laughter, a spiritual message, and a couple of twists that will surprise even the most devout. The best part is that it'll be 100 percent accurate."" Continued Christ: ""Even with the top-notch screenplay Ron and I are writing, I'll still need a great director to make the script shine. Unfortunately, Gore Verbinski is already committed to Pirates Of The Caribbean 2. If only he'd see that this movie is truly the career path for the righteous, I'd be able to get a firm commitment from Johnny Depp, too. Let us pray.""","entertainment, movies, religion, news, vol 40 issue 09, entertainment"

3441,Actress Opens Poorly Conceived Animal Shelter,"PACIFIC PALISADES, CA'Unwanted and abused dogs, cats, and other animals in Southern California now have a sort-of-friend in actress Alicia Silverstone, who opened the well-intentioned but poorly conceived StoneHaven animal shelter on her seaside estate last November. ""Alicia has always cared deeply about the welfare of animals, so this shelter is the realization of a lifelong dream for her,"" Silverstone's publicist Wendy Epstein said Monday. ""She threw it together quickly, and she's still hammering out the kinks, but she really loves animals, and it's wonderful to see someone try to make a difference."" A longtime lover of furry and feathered companions and an ardent believer in animal rights, Silverstone gladly gives tours of her animal sanctuary, which holds a diverse menagerie of more than 90 creatures. ""I've been in city-run shelters, and they're so depressing,"" said Silverstone, stroking a rabbit stricken with an advanced case of pinkeye. ""Here, the animals have all they can eat and a cozy place to sleep, in a big home with no cages. And there is absolutely no way I would ever murder an animal because I couldn't find a home for it."" Silverstone then placed the rabbit on the floor and pulled a 3-week-old kitten from between two sofa cushions. She cooed at the kitten as it licked and rubbed against her hand. Like many Hollywood stars, Silverstone is a vegan. Her animals are, too. ""Goats feed on grass and hay, so they instinctively understand the value of a macrobiotic diet, but getting the kids off milk is a challenge,"" said Silverstone, who acquired her small goat herd from a bankrupt Oxnard petting zoo. ""It's strange that they're not taking to the soy milk. Maybe I should try Rice Dream."" Silverstone said she noticed a marked decline in aggression among her 15 stray dogs after she put them on a meatless diet. ""When the doggies first arrived, they were always running around, jumping, and chasing each other,"" she said. ""But after their fruit fast, they calmed right down. Now, they're so sweet and quiet. I'm sure I'll have no trouble finding homes for them."" Silverstone is determined to give her creatures a life free from human-imposed hindrances. She ordered her shelter staff to remove the horseshoes from three former carnival ponies, and she recently gave a 17-year-old housecat its ""first-ever taste of freedom"" by placing it in the crook of a large tree to sunbathe. ""You won't see animals wearing collars, bridles, or leashes here,"" Silverstone said, as she placed a calming Wolves At Night ambient-sounds CD in the shelter's sound system. ""I don't even let anyone use the term 'housebreaking,' much less engage in the heartless practice."" Continued Silverstone: ""Sometimes the little guys resist my attempts to free their bodies and minds. The dogs would not sit still during their peppermint aromatherapy immersion yesterday. Sort of like former prisoners, these animals need to be reconditioned. They need their natural self-esteem and body-awareness rejuvenated."" Two tireless assistants aid Silverstone in her crusade. Though they do not have veterinary degrees, both, like Silverstone, claim to have a deep affinity for all creatures. ""Animals need to be loved and touched, just like humans do,"" assistant Heidi Aarons said, as she attempted to massage a tense guinea pig. ""We all share the cuddling, nesting instinct."" In spite of its devoted staff, Silverstone's dream project already faces challenges. The annual budget for 2004 has been exhausted on costly amenities such as bottled water, pet psychics, specially molded ""soy mice"" for the resident 32-foot boa constrictor, and printed programs for a ""commitment ceremony"" between a parrot and a ferret. In addition, fewer than 5 percent of potential adopters have passed Silverstone's stringent screening procedure. ""After my dog died of old age, I tried to adopt a puppy from StoneHaven,"" Los Angeles entertainment lawyer Barry Gelman said. ""In order to prove I was a worthy parent, Alicia told me I had to carry a stuffed dog around with me for a week. I was supposed to feed it with a bottle and change its diapers every three hours. She said she got the idea from an episode of Saved By The Bell."" Silverstone's resolve will be tested in the coming months. Neighbors have filed official complaints against StoneHaven regarding the noise, the stench, and the escaped animals frequently found outside its gates. Further, they claim that Silverstone's sentimental reluctance to spay, neuter, or fence in animals has caused a dramatic increase in stray dogs and cats in the area, as well as a serious pinkeye outbreak within a five-mile radius. But Silverstone isn't giving up. The actress has big ideas for the coming year, including her plan to take in more animals that ""aren't even that cute."" ""See Myrlie over there?"" asked Silverstone, as she pointed to a Komodo dragon sunning itself in a corner of the backyard. ""In a zoo, she'd be locked in a pen all day. But here, she can roam free, eat all the grass she wants, and play with Pepper, the pot-bellied pig. Zoos and city shelters simply don't give animals this kind of friendly environment.""","entertainment, celebrities, animals, news, vol 40 issue 04, entertainment"

3452,Pope John Paul II: 25 Years Of Laughs,"VATICAN CITY'As Pope John Paul II enters his 26th year as pontiff, the world is stopping to reflect on the legendary funnyman's career as one of the most influential performers in modern history. Standing staunchly against contraception and women's equality right through the turn of the 21st century, the pope and his quirky, deadpan comic persona still entertain audiences around the world. Revered by multiple generations for his weird and wonderful wit, the 83-year-old pontiff is perhaps the best-known stand-up alive today. Throughout an amazing two and a half decades as head of the Catholic Church, the pope has produced, in both his live appearances and his published works, a treasure trove of humor second to none. ""I can still remember seeing him do his classic 'Galileo' bit in the early '90s,"" said fellow comedian George Carlin, referring to the pope's 1992 declaration that the church erred in condemning Galileo. ""Here was this man, appearing on televisions around the world, making a proclamation that the sun does not move around the earth. I laughed until tears rolled down my cheeks."" ""No one could touch the pope,"" Carlin added. ""Hell, no one even tried. He was in a class of his own. One of a kind."" Born Karol Joseph Wojtyla in Wadowice, a town 35 miles southwest of Krakow, the pope did not have an easy childhood. In what may have contributed to his desire to inspire laughter, he faced many early hardships. His mother died just a month before his 9th birthday, and only three years later, his brother died of scarlet fever. The pope began his religious career shortly thereafter, studying in an underground seminary in Krakow. He established himself in the Krakow scene and was awarded an archbishopric in 1963. He made cardinal in 1967. Among the works to give the pope his first taste of fame was his 1960 treatise Love And Responsibility, in which he defined a ""modern Catholic sexual ethic."" It was here that the pope developed his oft-repeated chestnut that the only acceptable act of sex is one intended for the creation of a child. ""The pope would always lean on his material about sex,"" director Woody Allen said. ""He had this crazy, special way of looking at the world. I definitely count him among my influences."" After years of working the smaller cathedrals, the pope's hard work paid off. On Oct. 16, 1978, he was chosen to head Rome's most venerated comedic institution, the Vatican. ""No one else is still doing what the Vatican does,"" comedian Don Rickles said. ""They may not be as big as they once were, but they still surprise'like that bit a few weeks ago, where they said condoms don't prevent AIDS. Was that improvised?"" After 25 years at the top of his field, the pope still draws a crowd. On Oct. 19, he presided over the beatification of Mother Teresa. More than a quarter of a million people flooded St. Peter's Square to witness the stunt, in which the pope declared that the hard-working, benevolent nun had performed miracles and possessed supernatural powers. The pope has created more saints and beatified more people than all the previous popes combined, and no other pope has toured as extensively as he has. The quintessential showman loves to take his act on the road. He's entertained audiences in 117 countries and met with hundreds of world leaders, including dictators Augusto Pinochet and Fidel Castro. ""John Paul is the hardest-working pope in history,"" actor Jonathan Winters said. ""He's an inspiration. And not just for other comedians like myself, but for everyone, from theologians who will never be ordained because they're women, on down to the little children in the crowded ghettos of Third World cities who heed his message about the evils of contraception. Let's not even go into the gays in Boise."" Since his first trip back to Poland in 1978, the pope has performed in front of millions of loyal fans all over the world. ""People would wait in line for hours to see him,"" comedian Joey Bishop said. ""And he never failed to deliver. He'd be out there working the crowd'shaking hands, kissing babies. Wherever he went, they loved him."" The pope has also been lauded for his ability to think on his feet. Throughout his many years in the business, the pope has often been called upon to deliver a comeback when questioned about acts committed by the Catholic Church. ""John Paul II has riffed on everything from the Crusades and the Spanish Inquisition to the treatment of Jews and blacks,"" actor Bob Newhart said.""He's always had a unique ability to come at things in an unexpected way. I saw him last year on TV, talking about those molestation scandals. His main message was that Catholics shouldn't lose faith in the clergy. Hilarious! Now, I would've gone straight to some kind of apology to the victims, but I guess that's why he's the pope."" The master of the lightning-speed one-liner produced a string of memorable side-splitters earlier this year. When meeting with the Dutch ambassador to the Vatican, he referenced the country's laws governing same-sex unions. Condemning the laws, the pope said that sexual relationships are for ""men and women whose love will yield children,"" and characterized gays as deviants who act contrary to ""natural law."" Despite suffering from debilitating Parkinson's disease, the pope shows no signs of toning down his act. With his trademark wit, the pontiff recently announced that, in spite of his failing health, he will remain pope ""as long as God wants."" ""There will never be another Pope John Paul II,"" said comedian Jerry Stiller. ""He's truly one of a kind, straight out of a time and place that no longer exist.""","entertainment, celebrities, religion, christianity, pope, news, vol 39 issue 42, entertainment"

3454,Study Finds Cable-TV Violence Leads To Network-TV Violence,"LOS ANGELES'A two-year study of television programming has established a link between cable-TV violence and violent scenarios on network television, the Institute for Media Research announced Monday. ""Our data shows that cable violence, particularly the more brutal, consequence-free violence found on premium-cable channels like HBO, leads to violence on broadcast channels like ABC, NBC, CBS, and Fox,"" IMR researcher Donald Peck said. ""This phenomenon has created an ever-widening spiral of violence on our nation's airwaves."" Peck said the IMR based its report on analysis of 700,000 hours of cable- and network-TV broadcasts from the past 20 years. According to the report, prior to the advent of cable television, relatively little gratuitous violence aired on network television. In the years since the proliferation of cable, however, incidents of violent entertainment have increased dramatically. ""Back in the late '70s, when cable was in its infancy, the most violent image you were likely to see on network television was the Incredible Hulk bending a metal bar,"" Peck said. ""Now, entire network programs, like Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, are devoted to violent sexual assault. Where is this behavior coming from? It must have been learned somewhere, or people on TV would still emerge from car wrecks dazed but uninjured."" ""Something must be done to stop this cycle of violence,"" Peck added. ""It's killing America's TV children."" According to IMR statistics, a cable-television character is killed once every seven minutes. Between 9 and 11 p.m. EST, that rate is even higher. ""Some will argue that cable-TV violence is irrelevant to the real problem'violence on the nation's broadcast channels,"" Peck said. ""But our study revealed that cable television has a quantifiable effect on young network shows. Impressionable shows often look up to their cable counterparts'who have greater freedom'and imitate them in an effort to stay 'edgy.'"" Peck said that even when cable networks aren't emulating cable shows, they often use cable shows to justify their own violent content. ""Networks see The Sopranos and The Shield, and they think they're seeing normal TV reality,"" Peck said. ""They use it to justify their own violent content on everything from their family dramas to their police and courtroom thrillers."" Peck said that, ironically, television crime fighters are the most significant perpetrators of TV violence. ""TV cops say they're fighting violence, but more often than not, their own shows are the worst offenders,"" Peck said. ""The cops on Law & Order claim to be working for the good of minor characters, but the more violent criminals they find and convict, the more spin-offs they create. These shows trade in the violence they purportedly denounce, and the violence spreads like a disease to other channels."" Peck said the study found that when violence begins to spread on the network level, the overall negative effect on the safety of television characters increases dramatically. ""Even though the acts depicted on network television tend to be less violent than those depicted on cable, there are more of them, and the net result is an increase in the amount of episodic violence,"" Peck said. ""In this way, they do more damage than the premium-cable programs they emulate could ever do'even ones as popular as The Sopranos or Oz."" ""Our findings are hardly surprising,"" Peck added. ""Just last month, we released a similar report linking sexual promiscuity on cable shows like Sex And The City to increased sexual activity on young network shows like Coupling."" Sandra Gunderfeld, a member of the San Francisco-based television-character advocacy organization Stop All The Violence, expressed dismay at the IMR's findings. ""The fictionalized depiction of crime and violence is the greatest problem facing Americans on TV today,"" Gunderfeld said. ""The IMR's message is clear. If we want to stop violence on network television, we need to attack it at its source: cable television. That's the way to make all of TV Land safer."" Fictional detective Andy Sipowicz said he is no stranger to the harsh reality of make-believe violence on network-television streets. ""It's true that something must be done,"" said the long-running character, speaking words written by NYPD Blue creator Steven Bochco. ""You don't know what it's like for us imaginary characters out there on the front lines of America's TV streets."" ""Every day, our made-up lives are on the line,"" Sipowicz continued. ""If we catch a bullet, there's no way of knowing what could happen, at least not until after the next commercial break. Many who have fallen in the line of duty never make it back into the storyline. They're gone forever.""","entertainment, tv, violence, news, vol 39 issue 40, entertainment"

3461,Actress Excited To Land Eating-Disorder Ad,"NEW YORK'Actress Bianca Astor, 22, was excited to be cast in the role of a woman who suffers from anorexia nervosa for a filmed public-service announcement Monday. ""I can't believe it!"" Astor said upon receiving the call from her agent. ""I honestly didn't think I was going to get the part. I'm pretty thin, but I didn't think I was eating-disorder thin. I guess I am!"" The spot for the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders is part of a campaign designed to raise the public's awareness of eating disorders. According to ANAD statistics, 1 in 100 adolescent girls suffers from anorexia. ""The cool thing is that I'll be helping to make a difference,"" Astor said. ""Besides appearing in the TV ads, I'll also be on billboards and the sides of buses. Everyone in the country will see me as the super-skinny girl."" ""This will look really good on my résumé,"" Astor added. ""I tried to pick glossies that were flattering, but this will definitely help drive home the point that I can play thin."" Astor has struggled to get her acting career off the ground ever since she moved to New York four years ago. She has modeled sporadically and worked as an extra on several daytime soap operas, and also appeared in two commercials, portraying Smiling Woman #4 in a Gap ad and a fungicidal-cream user for Lamisil. The anorexia spot marks her first starring role and the first to highlight her extreme boniness. ""I was really nervous when I went in for the audition,"" Astor said. ""When I got to the waiting room, I thought, 'I'll never be able to compete with all these girls.' I was checking out their hips, and mine were definitely wider than a couple women's. But I guess that in the end, I was the one with the right combination of talent and physique."" Astor said she doesn't suffer from an eating disorder, but is lucky enough to have been born with a slight build. ""I've just always been thin, ever since junior high,"" Astor said. ""I'm blessed with a fast metabolism. Plus, I work out at the gym for three hours a day. And I'm careful to watch what I eat. And I dye my hair because my agent said it makes my face look more defined."" Astor's agent, Allied Arts' Debra Fayhill, said she's proud of her 5'8"", 101-pound client. ""I'm so excited for her,"" Fayhill said. ""I called her up and told her that the producers thought she was perfect for the role of Gretchen, the wholesome 20-ish woman who's starving herself to death. I've never heard anyone scream so loud."" Continued Fayhill: ""Not many actresses get a chance to have this sort of impact on young girls. Hopefully, she'll really make a big difference in girls' lives, and stick in casting agents' minds when they need a beautiful, hollow-eyed wraith."" Although few PSA actresses have gone on to great success, Fayhill said she is optimistic. ""Look at Rachael Leigh Cook,"" Fayhill said. ""She starred in the 1998 'Frying Pan' anti-drug spot from Margeotes, Fertitta + Partners, and she went on to play skinny women in the movies. Bianca is on the same track."" Astor is already practicing her line for the role. According to the script, her ad will open with a close-up on a ""frail, emaciated hand."" The hand will reach across a restaurant table toward a piece of bread. The camera will pull out to reveal Gretchen sitting in a restaurant with a friend. Gretchen will change her mind and drop the piece of bread. The friend will ask what's wrong, and Gretchen will say, ""Nothing."" The word will echo eerily as the scene fades out to reveal a grave. ""Emaciated,"" Astor said, smiling and examining her hand held at arm's length. After she was selected for the role, Astor called her friends to celebrate with a night on the town. ""Bianca was all, 'Do you really think I'm thin enough to play an anorexic?'"" friend Fiona Lin said. ""All of us kept saying 'Yes, totally.' She shouldn't doubt herself. She looks fantastic. Out of all of us, she so has the most visible rib cage."" Not all of Astor's friends say she's thin enough for the part. ""Bianca's thinner than most of us, but she's not very proportional,"" friend and fellow actress Tia Rialto said. ""Personally, I'd buy her as a bulimic, but never an anorexic. Have you seen the flab under that girl's arms? Ugh.""","entertainment, advertising, news, vol 39 issue 37, entertainment"
3462,History Of Rock Written By The Losers,"BOSTON'Fifty years after its inception, rock 'n' roll music remains popular due to the ardor of its fans and the hard work of musicians, producers, and concert promoters. But in the vast universe of popular music, there exists an oft-overlooked group of dedicated individuals who devote their ample free time to collecting, debating, and publishing the minutiae of the rock genre. They are the losers who write rock's rich and storied history. ""The city of Boston is about more than just Mission Of Burma or Galaxie 500, and it's certainly about more than Boston or The Cars,"" said 28-year-old Dana Harris, a rock historian. ""The scene in Boston is full of history, but it's also vibrant right now. Someone needs to record all the amazing things going on here, even if it means that person will never have a social life."" For Harris, rock is the only topic of conversation and the only form of entertainment. While other men his age go on dates or enjoy the sunlight, Harris haunts the rear corners of local rock clubs like The Paradise, where he sits alone, hunched over a notebook. During the day, he works in his windowless bedroom compiling facts about the city's rock history for his web site, BostonRockScene.com. ""Rock is so important to me,"" Harris said, gesturing to a cabinet where he files articles concerning all of the live shows he attends and detailed transcriptions of interviews with artists who live only blocks away. ""If I couldn't write about music and collect music, I have no idea what I'd do instead."" The social misfits who chronicle rock seek not only to log facts, but also to influence public opinion about obscure rock issues, something most people care little about. ""Joe Lunchpail would say 'Rock Around The Clock' by Bill Haley & His Comets was the first rock single, but that's dead wrong,"" said Dave Rinkin, a line cook in Chapel Hill, NC, who occasionally writes for Roctober magazine and has a collection of more than 10,000 records. ""Haley's song just brought the sound to the mainstream. Anyone who knows anything will say the first single was either Roy Brown's 'Good Rockin' Tonight' or 'Rocket 88' by Jackie Brenston And His Delta Cats."" Added Rinkin: ""Brenston And His Delta Cats was actually Ike Turner's Kings Of Rhythm under a different name, in case you didn't know."" From covering concerts for a local newspaper to distilling rock's history into an 800-page book, the historians of rock 'n' roll soldier on, despite their negligible impact on the direction or quality of rock itself. ""When you're writing rock's history, you have to make some hard choices,"" said Anthony DeCurtis, one of the editors of The Rolling Stone Illustrated History Of Rock. ""Do you give equal space to influential artists like Jonathan Richman, Gang Of Four, and Fugazi, even though they're not as well known as Madonna or Elton John? Making a decision like that can take an entire weekend of soul-searching."" ""I don't mind, though, because I love music,"" added DeCurtis, slipping a Cream CD just to the left of one by The Creation in the British Invasion section of his music collection. ""Rock is just so spontaneous and full of life."" Not all rock history is comprehensive. Many rock historians choose to focus on individual artists who can barely tolerate the authors when they meet. In-depth rock bios have been written about acts ranging from Bruce Springsteen to Captain Beefheart, with biographers desperately trying to attain coolness by association with their subjects. ""Talking Heads was a crucial band for its time,"" said David Bowman, author of This Must Be The Place: The Adventures Of The Talking Heads In The 20th Century. ""Their quirky brand of music brought African and funk flavors to American pop, both in the underground and on Top 40 radio. David Byrne's influence can still be heard in modern hip-hop. If you have a couple hours, I'd be happy to talk at you about it."" Although rock historians provide a valuable service to music fanatics, Princeton sociology professor Henry Yates said that their focus on music hinders their accumulation of knowledge in other areas. ""From discussing long-defunct record labels to analyzing the impact of a band's personnel changes, rock historians cannot see beyond their acne-scarred noses to realize that there are interesting subjects in the world besides music,"" said Yates, a self-professed ""ex-music-nerd."" ""If you ask them who the U.S. attorney general is, or what's going on in the park around the corner, you'll get a blank stare. But ask which member of The Doors produced Los Angeles, the debut album by X, and you'll have to dodge all the flying spittle from everyone trying to be the first to answer."" Added Yates: ""It was Ray Manzarek.""","entertainment, music, history, culture, news, vol 39 issue 36, entertainment"

3464,I'll Thank You Not To Call My Collection Of Sequential-Art Erotica 'Dirty Comics',"I've been called many unfair names in my day, Grygor, but I never imagined that someone I consider a friend would label me an ""onanist"" before the entire Animatrix-message-board community. The personal attack was beneath the dignity of an erstwhile standard-bearer of the fan community. I'll thank you, Grygor, to discontinue forthwith your practice of referring to the works contained in my collection of sequential-art erotica as ""dirty comics."" Although it may come as news to you, there is a long tradition of sequential artworks in celebration of the human love-act. The works in my collection are borne out of this tradition, and exist far afield from the base pornography you referred to in your posting of Tuesday. How dare you call the pieces in my extensive collection of erotic animated-film stills ""girlie cartoons""? Do you honestly compare the masterful line drawings of Milo Manara's Butterscotch series to the pandering output of Wicked Pictures or Larry Flynt Publications? (Your stance on such lesser forms of erotica is well-known, Grygor. Or am I to suppose that the Nikita Denise ""Stars Of Adult Cinema"" action figure I saw in your merch-bag at San Diego ComiCon got in there by mistake?) Manara'not that you would be aware of this'is famed throughout the Continent, though sadly unappreciated on these shores, thanks to the ignorance of philistines like yourself. Are you familiar with Manara's collaborations with a certain Federico Fellini, a man who is seen in Italy as a filmmaker on par with our Lucas? For your information, Grygor, breathtaking depictions of the female form are considered high art in Europe. But I'm willing to bet that Europe's finest comics lie entirely outside of your realm of knowledge, even though you call yourself a fan of ""the ninth art."" (The French rank comics equally among the other arts'ballet, opera, and the like. Comic artists there enjoy a level of respect that is, in this country, bestowed only upon such universally regarded masters as Rob Liefeld, Todd McFarlane, and Alex Ross.) But your familiarity with comics is so limited, you couldn't identify Aquaman's wife without recourse to the Justice League FAQ! To think I believed you capable of appreciating the works of the finest erotic artists working in the medium today! Even your knowledge of Metal Hurlant's internationally acclaimed Moebius is confined to the production sketches from The Fifth Element. (Perhaps you've heard of a little something called the Incal series? Oh, great suns of Krypton! Something Grygor doesn't know?!) Grygor, there is nothing ""dirty"" about the nude female form, as explored in the Eros sampler Submissive Suzanne #5. I should not be publicly ridiculed simply because I, as a mature adult, have an appreciation for aspects of sexuality lost on an infantile ignoramus such as yourself. I had no reason to take you into my confidence, Grygor, and show you my collection in the first place, save my evidently incorrect appraisal of you as someone who could appreciate the finer things of fandom. And how did you reward my trust? By calling me ""Pervertimus Prime"" before the entire online community. Far from aberrant, my collection represents the full breadth and width of human sexuality. My works range from serious literary works like Story Of O, by Guido Crepax, to such playful fare as Cherry Poptart, by Larry Welz. And, for your information, the majority of the comics you so cruelly maligned are published by no less an authority on the form than Gary Groth. Had you behaved with more maturity, I might have shown you the crown jewel of my collection: a signed first-edition copy of the moving tale of an anthropomorphic cat's personal journey into sexual discovery, Reed Waller and Kate Worley's Omaha The Cat Dancer. Oh, but you'll never see that, Grygor. Nor will you ever lay your eyes upon Frank Thorne's Ghita Of Alhizaar, Lann, or the timeless classic Moonshine McJuggs. The sophisticated sensibilities of works like the Little Annie Fanny: Complete Hardcover Limited Edition are beyond the scope of your intellect, as well. As, I am guessing, would be my extensive collection of the finest mangerotica available outside of Japan. No, those tender coming-of-age stories would be as pearls before swine. I hope you realize now, Grygor'or shall I call you ""trinitysbyfrnd,"" as I see that is what you're calling yourself on the Wachowski Brothers message board'that there is nothing ""dirty"" about my erotica collection, save what ""dirtiness"" you, in your benightedness, brought to it. Until you learn to show respect for that which you clearly know nothing about, consider your instant-message username blocked.

3470,Gigli Focus Groups Demand New Ending In Which Both Affleck And Lopez Die,"HOLLYWOOD, CA'Focus groups at advance screenings for Gigli, a romantic comedy starring Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez set to open nationwide July 30, have demanded a new ending in which both stars die ""in as brutal a manner as possible,"" sources at Sony Pictures said Tuesday. ""The movie is pretty good, I guess,"" read one comment card from a test-screening audience in Culver City, CA. ""I liked the Al Pacino character, but I had a hard time buying Jennifer Lopez as a lesbian. I also really, really wanted [Affleck and Lopez's characters] Larry and Ricki to die, to get shot or blown up or run over by something. I would prefer to see the blood and the looks on their faces."" On Monday, 3,000 people in markets as varied as Dallas, Chicago, Albany, Atlanta, and Seattle screened Gigli, a gangster-themed romantic comedy written and directed by Martin Brest, in which lowly thug Affleck lets his love for hitwoman Lopez get in the way of a high-risk mob assignment. Of those viewers, 2,965 ""strongly agreed"" that the ending should be changed to include a graphic scene in which its main characters die. ""Many participants wrote 'shot to death' in the space provided for comments, probably thinking that it fit in with the gangster characters' stated realities,"" Columbia Pictures director of marketing Peter Zitterman said. ""Some comments showed a lot of careful thought, such as 'point blank through head from right side,' 'both at once with single shot from elephant gun,' and 'several hundred times, with multiple camera angles showing their bodies jerking as they're shredded with a heavy hosing of lead, spraying the lens with gobbets of meat and bone and blood, with the sheer number of fist-sized exit wounds obviously precluding any sequel.' And shootings weren't the only ideas suggested, believe me."" According to the exit cards, other popular methods of achieving Lopez and Affleck's on-screen demise included car bombs, multiple stab wounds, acid baths, rabid wolf attacks, lightning strikes, and, in one case, a ""hammer party."" ""We never expected this kind of reaction,"" Zitterman said. ""We've had odd results from focus groups before, but I don't recall an audience ever agreeing on such a sweeping change. If only we had done this survey in pre-production."" Although the various test audiences differed on the preferred methods of death, they seemed unanimous on one point. ""We were very surprised at how many viewers thought that, no matter what, Affleck and Lopez should not be entwined in a romantic embrace at the time of their deaths,"" Zitterman said. ""Everyone was perfectly clear on that."" Although Brest said he is satisfied with the final cut of Gigli, he briefly considered incorporating some of the test audience's ideas into the film. ""The danger here is succumbing to what people in the business call 'option paralysis''being caught with so many good ideas that you're not sure which one to use,"" Brest said. ""Getting shot is fine, but what about an automobile fire in which Ben and Jennifer are shown perishing in a slow-motion montage, their newfound love discarded as they try desperately to claw their way past each other's melting bodies, while slowly roasting to death in their own fat? You'd be surprised at how many people came up with that one. Or having them crawl through a field of broken glass while a safely booted and gloved Christopher Walken casually advances on them with a spray bottle of acid and a pair of bolt-cutters? I must say, a part of me loves the idea of them chewing each other to death during a 14-minute dolly shot."" Added Brest: ""Believe me, after the singular experience of working with these two for several months, it would be a joy to get back together just to make these changes."" Even if time were not prohibitive, Columbia executives remained skeptical about the validity of the focus-group results. ""I find it hard to believe that audiences would harbor hostility toward such major media figures as J. Lo and Ben,"" Zitterman said. ""With her magazine covers, clothing and perfume lines, and constant radio presence; his roles in Daredevil and Project Greenlight; and their recent joint appearances on Dateline NBC and numerous entertainment shows, how could anyone wish for anything but a resolution that unites these two attractive, highly visible celebrities?"" Insiders confirm that time constraints will prevent the much-requested death-scene additions to Gigli, which already underwent several days of fine-tuning when earlier focus groups noted a lack of romantic chemistry from the real-life couple. In light of the results, however, director Kevin Smith has said he will consider adding a gruesome double homicide to his Affleck-Lopez comedy Jersey Girl, due in theaters next year.","entertainment, celebrities, movies, news, vol 39 issue 29, entertainment"
3471,Gigli Focus Groups Demand New Ending In Which Both Affleck And Lopez Die,"HOLLYWOOD, CA'Focus groups at advance screenings for Gigli, a romantic comedy starring Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez set to open nationwide July 30, have demanded a new ending in which both stars die ""in as brutal a manner as possible,"" sources at Sony Pictures said Tuesday. ""The movie is pretty good, I guess,"" read one comment card from a test-screening audience in Culver City, CA. ""I liked the Al Pacino character, but I had a hard time buying Jennifer Lopez as a lesbian. I also really, really wanted [Affleck and Lopez's characters] Larry and Ricki to die, to get shot or blown up or run over by something. I would prefer to see the blood and the looks on their faces."" On Monday, 3,000 people in markets as varied as Dallas, Chicago, Albany, Atlanta, and Seattle screened Gigli, a gangster-themed romantic comedy written and directed by Martin Brest, in which lowly thug Affleck lets his love for hitwoman Lopez get in the way of a high-risk mob assignment. Of those viewers, 2,965 ""strongly agreed"" that the ending should be changed to include a graphic scene in which its main characters die. ""Many participants wrote 'shot to death' in the space provided for comments, probably thinking that it fit in with the gangster characters' stated realities,"" Columbia Pictures director of marketing Peter Zitterman said. ""Some comments showed a lot of careful thought, such as 'point blank through head from right side,' 'both at once with single shot from elephant gun,' and 'several hundred times, with multiple camera angles showing their bodies jerking as they're shredded with a heavy hosing of lead, spraying the lens with gobbets of meat and bone and blood, with the sheer number of fist-sized exit wounds obviously precluding any sequel.' And shootings weren't the only ideas suggested, believe me."" According to the exit cards, other popular methods of achieving Lopez and Affleck's on-screen demise included car bombs, multiple stab wounds, acid baths, rabid wolf attacks, lightning strikes, and, in one case, a ""hammer party.""

3472,LAPD Discovers Hidden Deformed Olsen Triplet,"LOS ANGELES'A ragged and misshapen girl officials are calling a ""third Olsen twin"" was rescued from the basement of the residence of teen superstars Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen Tuesday, Los Angeles police said. ""The girl has been positively identified as a sister of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, born on the same day in June 1986,"" said LAPD Capt. Ellen Yanez, relating information provided in a confession by parents David and Janette Olsen, now divorced. ""The monstrously contorted child was discovered living in conditions that could charitably be described as squalid."" Currently in custody at LAPD headquarters, the twisted, hunched, foul-smelling figure of Ethel Olsen, 17, is drawing both pity and horror from investigators. ""With hair covering over 60 percent of her diminutive body, teeth protruding through her bottom lip, and her only useful limb a prehensile claw, Ethel would make a poor slumber-party companion,"" Yanez said. ""The Olsen family's actions are understandable, if ultimately unconscionable."" According to Yanez, the Olsen family was able to conceal Ethel's birth from public record because the triplets were born during a camping trip in an isolated area of the Sierra Nevada mountains. ""Ethel was reportedly the last to be delivered, and the family recoiled in horror to see such a deformed and unsightly creature emerge from a womb that had housed her two cherubic sisters,"" Yanez said. ""A reluctant sense of duty toward the infant forced her parents to bring her home, but pity soon turned to revulsion, and after a ghastly and traumatic attempt at nursing, the wretch was relegated to the cellar, where she was locked in a cage and fed through a garden hose."" The Olsens' plans to anonymously abandon Ethel at a convent were thwarted in 1987, when Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, barely 1 year old, found fame sharing the role of Michelle Tanner on the ABC sitcom Full House. ""The parents didn't want to risk any chance of negative publicity,"" said Lieut. Ron Mudd, one of the detectives who questioned the Olsens. ""Someone at an orphanage might have spotted the dim similarities the hideous mutant bore to her apple-cheeked siblings, who only grew in popularity as the years went by."" Continued Mudd: ""It appears that Ethel was continuously kept on the cusp of survival, the family's tenuous belief in the sanctity of life the only thing that kept her fed and sheltered. That she received no love is evident. To be fair, it is hard to love someone whose hairless body parts are covered with scales, half-inch thick toenails, and a harelip that extends past her brow."" Although an investigation is still underway, some details of Ethel's 17 tortured years have been made public. According to the police report, Ethel's cellar dwelling had no heat or ventilation, and only a single grimy, barred basement window provided light. There was no plumbing, so Ethel was forced to scuttle into a corner and defecate in a drain. When found, the girl was clad in mismatched, threadbare castoffs from Mary-Kate and Ashley's Wal-Mart clothing line. She slept on a heavily tarnished serving tray believed to have been taken from a craft-services table on the set of the 2001 straight-to-video release Holiday In The Sun. Police say she subsisted on rainwater, half-eaten bagels salvaged from talk-show green rooms, and any small rodents she was able to catch; she saved their bones in a corner, along with a pile of coughed-up pellets. The girl owned no toys other than a headless Mattel Ashley doll, onto which she had stuck hanks of her own body hair. Investigators say that Ethel communicates in guttural grunts and wheezes, as well as the occasional piercing howl. She is fond of rocking on her haunches and humming the same tune fragment, which is believed to be an extremely off-key version of the song ""I Am The Cute One,"" recorded by the Olsen Twins in 1992. ""Perhaps she heard the song emanating from upstairs and it made an impression in her twisted, imbecilic psyche,"" Mudd said. ""The irony is annihilating."" Police rescued Ethel after receiving a tip from an aromatherapist employed by the Olsens. The woman alerted authorities that she had detected a ""distinctly un-jasminelike"" odor emanating from the basement door of the three-story home. Ethel's condition has shocked even those on the battle-hardened LAPD. ""My daughter loves Mary-Kate and Ashley, and this is going to be hard to explain to her,"" Mudd said. ""In a way, I wish we'd never found Ethel. As a cop, I see a lot of ugliness every day, but this devastates me. How could something so hideous be connected to something so pure and wholesome?"" The Olsen parents face multiple charges of child abuse and reckless endangerment of a minor, but they are also reportedly in negotiations with television executives to develop a sitcom starring Ethel. ""The parents who did this should be punished,"" said Linda Spassky, vice-president in charge of programming for ABC Family Channel, which airs the Olsen Twins sitcom So Little Time. ""But there is no reason to continue to hurt poor Ethel with further sequestering. After all, she has that magical Olsen name, and that means guaranteed tween appeal.""","entertainment, celebrities, kids, crime, news, vol 39 issue 28, entertainment"

3480,Who Will Carry On My PlayStation 2 Adventures After I'm Gone?,"I'll admit, I've had a good run. Done pretty much everything I wanted, accomplished almost everything I set out to do. I fought my way to the top of the criminal hierarchy of two cities, saved the world from unspeakably evil magical and technological conspiracies, went to six Super Bowls, and unified ancient China under three different dynasties. It's a legacy any man would be proud of, yet it is one that raises an obvious question: Who will carry on my PlayStation 2 adventures after I'm gone? I know, I know, I'm still young. It's a bit premature to be thinking of my own mortality. But seeing so much pointless death does something to you. Especially if you've ever died and forgotten to save after narrowly defeating Ultima Weapon, wasting hours of back-breaking, finger-numbing toil. You start thinking about how death comes to everyone eventually. You think about how, even after finding every last hidden package in Vice City, there's still so much left to do. And you realize that nothing, not even the original Xenogears, lasts forever. Which brings us back to the question: Who will carry on my legacy? I live alone, never having taken a wife. How could I have? My life of polygon-based adventures has left me no time for anyone else. A marriage takes work, and no woman could have my full attention. And that is not likely to change, considering that Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater was just announced last week. But even if I don't last forever, my accomplishments will. I refuse to believe that everything I've built on the bones of a thousand Iron Fist Tournament fighters, on the shattered hulks of a thousand giant robots, on the ruins of three separate Metal Gear bases will one day disappear. No, if I believed that, I'd stop playing right now. Or at least right after getting the Tracer Tong/New Dark Age ending on Deus Ex, which shouldn't take more than an hour, even if I don't check GameFAQs to see where the damn Reactor Purge switch is hidden. Yes, I may pass from the world without a successor, but I will not go into that good night unaccomplished. My five full memory cards of Complete and 100 Percent Finished game saves will ensure that. There is still hope that I will find a woman and, with her, sire an heir to continue my work. But I'm not getting any younger. I first noticed it in little ways, such as my loss of appreciation for the Mario titles. When I grew apart from Nintendo and its cartoon games, it was part of the maturation process, a sign of my readiness for a more sophisticated, grown-up gaming system. Someday, the PlayStation 2 will no longer be enough for me, and I'll put it aside and go on to other systems without regret'especially since Sony's next system will probably be backwards-compatible with older games, as the PS2 was with PS1 titles. When I do, I will be one step closer to that Final Level we all eventually reach. Even without a clear heir, there are ways for me to leave my mark on the next generation. I can be a mentor, serving as a master to some worthy apprentice. If nothing else, I could always pass on my wisdom as that fatherly guy behind the trade-in counter of the local game store. But whatever form my legacy takes, I firmly believe that someone will continue my work in some fashion. If there's one thing I learned from Parappa The Rapper, it's that you gotta believe.","opinion, entertainment, commentary, vol 39 issue 21, jon crewes, entertainment"

""I had a sense that we were doing pretty well,"" Brant said. ""So I checked around with the pit bosses, and it turned out that nearly all the dealers and croupiers were way, way ahead.

Then we spread our bets around to each and every table and machine in the casino and keep at it for the long haul. We were down about $200 at one of the roulette tables, but were up on everything else, so we came out pretty much ahead. Actually, more than half a million ahead."" Bally's even fared well at the slot machines, an area that traditionally yields the lowest rate of success. ""You know how they say your worst odds are on the slots?"" Brant said. ""Well, we made over $33,000 in slots last night. Can you believe it? We were unstoppable."" Brant attributed his casino's impressive showing to a combination of luck and old-fashioned horse sense.

In spite of its huge winnings, Bally's did not indulge in the traditional amenities offered to big winners, such as a free night's stay in the hotel or meal vouchers.

When the officers attempted to remove Hitchens from the premises, the leftist intellectual became physically and verbally abusive toward the officers, calling them ""shitkickers,"" ""bitches,"" and ""effete liberal apologists for the atrocities of late-stage capitalism."" Having consumed what sources described as ""a substantial amount of single-malt scotch,"" Hitchens then burst into tears, yelling, ""That woman never understood me for who I am. I want to talk to [Harper's editor Lewis] Lapham. Lapham's the only one who understands me."" Charged with disturbing the peace, Hitchens was taken to the Sparta police station at 3 p.m. and released four hours later. Little is known about Bodell, a heavy-set blonde who has been known to use several different surnames. According to sources familiar with the couple, the incident marks the third time in as many weeks that police have been forced to intervene in their volatile relationship. ""We're down at the old Hitchens place probably twice a month at least,"" said Sgt. Wilson Vernon, the first of three officers to arrive at the scene. ""Once his blood's up, old Hitch can get meaner than a three-legged coon hound. From what the neighbors told us about this latest incident, Noreen was all worked up, accusing him of drinking and womanizing. He was angry with her refusal to acknowledge that there is ample evidence to make a case for prosecuting Henry Kissinger as a war criminal. She just kept shouting, 'No, there ain't!'"" Police were initially summoned when neighbors reported hearing shouting and a loud crash, followed by a rambling polemic on Kissinger's alleged covert approval of Indonesia's illegal invasion of East Timor in 1975. Though the belligerent Hitchens required three officers to subdue him, police do not consider the incident serious, calling it ""business as usual"" and describing Hitchens as a ""hot-tempered but essentially harmless provocateur for the Far Left."" ""Hitch is an all-right guy once he sobers up,"" Vernon said. ""He just gets a little wound-up sometimes, like when his woman stays out all night down at Smokey Joe's Tavern, or he has a deadline looming for his Vanity Fair column."" Hitchens' run-ins with the law have not been restricted to Sparta city limits. In May 2002, he was arrested for drunkenly singing 1930s union songs while driving a stolen riding lawnmower through the streets of Boston, where he was attending an international women's-rights conference. Hitchens accused police of ""atavistic, morally reprehensible Stalinist scare tactics"" before being bailed out by conference organizers the following morning. Sgt. Ed Poole of Boston's 11th Precinct said there was no love lost between Hitchens and his arresting officers. ""Word got around the station that this guy wrote a whole book claiming that Mother Teresa was a stooge of right-wing dictators,"" Poole recalled. ""Supposedly, he said her hypocritical approach to charity for the poor of Calcutta, as well as her steadfast advocacy of the Catholic Church's doctrine prohibiting birth control, made her an essentially immoral individual undeserving of the mantle of sainthood. Well, a lot of the boys here are Irish-Catholic born and raised, and they don't take too kindly to people speaking ill of nuns."" Town officials in Sparta, where Hitchens has maintained an on-again, off-again residence for two decades, admit that he may be ""a handful"" at times, but they insist he is not a danger to himself or others. ""If I know Hitch, by the end of the week, he and Noreen'll be back together, cuddlin' and kissin', just as happy as two crawdads in a pond,"" Sparta Police Chief Buck Perkins said. ""We don't get a lot of ultra-progressive agitators 'round these parts, but Hitch is okay. Plus, he earned a lot of points with the townsfolk for his vocal criticism of the anti-war movement. Even though he was attacking the war opponents from the left, folks around here don't necessarily understand the implications of that, so he's an all-right Joe in their book."" Added Perkins: ""So long as Hitch can learn to keep his mouth shut about Christianity being symptomatic of the 'savage and ignorant prehistory of our species' and whatnot, I'm sure he'll cause no trouble that a few cups of black coffee and a night in the drunk tank can't solve.""","entertainment, celebrities, news, vol 39 issue 15, entertainment"

3490,I've Got Oscar (And War) Fever!,"Item! There's only one story on the minds of people across this great nation right now: the 75th anniversary Academy Awards. And Jackie Harvey was right there in the front rowEE of his living room! I know there are people out there who say there are more important things to worry about in these troubled times. Well, what better way to forget your troubles than with a fabulous awards ceremony? After all the talk about getting rid of the red carpet, they still had one, even if they didn't do any interviews on it. Out of respect for our troops, the dresses and tuxedos were a little more sedate, which was actually kind of nice. It reminded me of the glory days of the '40s and '50s, when you could see the likes of Agnes Moorehead and Kirk Douglas sitting in the crowd. Of course, Chicago was the big winner of the evening, hopefully ushering in a new age of the old razzle-dazzle. I, for one, would love to see a movie version of Cabaret. As for individual accolades, Julianne ""r From Heaven"" Moore can wait, because the woman of The Hours is Nicole Kidman. The Kiwi beauty was incredibly brave to wear a fake nose and cover her good looks in front of millions of moviegoers. If you ask me, she deserved her Oscar for that alone. Hey, it certainly didn't hurt the box office. Do I smell a sequel? The speeches mostly kept with the theme of quiet dignity, but who was the fat guy who rained on everyone's parade by yelling at our president? The Academy Awards are no place for people to make protest statements. He should have been more like dreamy Adrienne Brody. He was one class act. Plus, he was great in Willard. As for host Steve Martin, he was okay, but let's face it, he's no Billy Crystal. Item! You know, the best thing about the war is the new vernacular. I find the phrases from this particular war fascinating: ""shock and awe,"" ""embeds,"" ""decapitation attack,"" ""helicopter crash""f Whew! Those embeds (like a police ride-along, only with the military instead of the police) really bring home the superiority of our military. Good job, press corps, and God bless America! Item! I'm not a big fan of reality TV, but I am simply head-over-heels for Are You Hot Enough To Be Chosen By America? This is gripping and sexy television. If you haven't seen it, it's like a beauty contest with laser pointers and frank commentary on body fat. By getting right to the nitty-gritty, judge Lorenzo Llamas is helping these women find ways to improve themselves. Now there's a real American hero. When we're facing war, a bad economy, and no red-carpet interviews at the Academy Awards, don't sit around like a lump feeling sorry for yourself. Do what I do: Light some candles and take refuge in a nice, long bubble bath. Nothing is better for helping you forget the shock and awe of 4,500 bombs dropped on a major city, especially if you play a little Tina Turner while you're soaking. That Jon Cusack is the thinking man's Matthew Broderick. I was recently talking about great TV with some friends, and someone mentioned Miami Vice. Well, of course, there was the fashions and the locale, but the thing I remember most was the theme. I thought I'd impress my friends because I remembered it was by Jan Wenner. What I didn't know is that it's pronounced Yon Wenner. Boy, was my face red when I was corrected. Now I know, and now you know, true-believing readers. Learn from my mistake. Jacko? 'Nuff said! Well, that's all for now. Hopefully, the war will be over by the next time I come to you. If that happens, I'm sure I'll be brimming with news that's been buried by the war coverage. In the meantime, pop in your favorite movie and take a load off your mind, because you deserve it. Remember, Harveyheads: The bright lights of Hollywood are just as bright whether human beings are dying or not! Jackie Harvey graduated from Viterbo University with a degree in English literature in 1990. After honing his writing and copy-editing skills at The Sunshine Shopper, he became The Onion's entertainment columnist in 1994, replacing the outgoing Archie 'Arch' Danielson.

3495,Robin Williams Leaves Entertainment Reporter In Stitches,"LOS ANGELES'Comic wildman Robin Williams left Entertainment Tonight reporter Maria Menounos in stitches Monday, cracking her up with a manic, off-the-cuff comedic riff covering everything from Survivor to Botox. ""How does he come up with this stuff?"" asked a still-laughing Menounos, who interviewed Williams as he arrived at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel for a gala charity benefit for pediatric AIDS. ""When Robin's around, you never know what he's going to say. But one thing's for sure: It's guaranteed to be funny."" Williams, 50, is renowned for his surreal, free-associative detours, which have delighted countless entertainment reporters on both coasts. Williams went on the unexpected, wholly improvised comic tear when Menounos asked him about his outfit, a tuxedo accentuated by a pair of flashy, neon-purple cowboy boots. The query prompted Williams to launch into impersonations of a jive-talking black man and John Wayne before segueing into references to Joan Rivers, the reality-TV program Survivor, and the popular wrinkle remover Botox, leaving Menounos in what witnesses described as ""hysterics."" ""Yo, what is up, homeslice? Dis sucka be lookin' baaad tonight!"" said Williams, showing off his outfit to Menounos. ""Now listen, pilgrim, Monty Clift is down in Red River still lookin' for his boots. He's a little light in those loafers he's been wearin' lately, catch my drift? It's like Survivor: San FranciscoEE 'The tribe has spoken, and you look faaabulous!' Is Joan [Rivers] here tonight? Don't let her see me'her facelift stitches might pop out from the shock! Nurse, one million CCs of Botox, stat! No, we don't have time for the needle! Just back the truck up, fasten the hose, and pump it right into her skull! Boooop! Boooop! Boooop!""enounos responded to Williams with hearty laughter, eventually raising her hand in exhaustion and casting a ""How does he come up with this stuff?"" glance at the camera. ""It was classic Robin tonight,"" said fundraiser attendee Byron Allen, host of the recently cancelled junketainment program Kickin' It With Byron Allen. ""He pulled it off so effortlessly, and fresh from his recent Grammy appearance, no less, when he held his award for Best Comedy Album against his crotch. Just another day at the office for this comic genius."" Access Hollywood anchor Pat O'Brien said that Williams, whom he has frequently interviewed over the past two decades, is remarkable for his outrageous unpredictability. ""When I interviewed him for Mrs. Doubtfire, I asked him if playing a woman came naturally,"" O'Brien said. ""Although the question was posed seriously, I was kind of hoping it would set him up for a doozy of a spiel. And, boy, did it ever: Who knew he'd lisp in an effeminate voice, 'Why? What did you hear, Sweetcheeks?' and then, without warning, slip into a flawless impression of a televangelist exorcising a demon out of the lisping persona?"" ""I love how, when he's conducting an imaginary exchange between two radically different personas'say, a flamboyantly gay hairdresser and a creepily placid children's-show host'he whips his head around, left and right,"" Access Hollywood reporter Billy Bush said. ""It provides a helpful visual cue so you know when he's switching characters."" During a May 1992 press junket for the film Toys, Variety columnist Army Archerd had to be administered oxygen by paramedics after Williams overcame him with rapid-fire impressions of Jack Nicholson, a human beat box, and Ross Perot, squeezing in references to the savings-and-loan scandal and The Crying Game along the way. ""It was breathtaking to watch him weave all these seemingly unrelated pieces of pop culture into one side-splitting, completely ad-libbed routine,"" Extra host Leeza Gibbons said. ""Robin's a national treasure."" Jules Asner, co-host of E! News Live, explained why Williams enjoys such a devoted following among entertainment journalists. ""It's true that Nathan Lane, Jim Carrey, and Carrot Top possess a certain hyperactive, spontaneous quality,"" Asner said. ""Those guys are all incredibly zany and off-the-wall. But nobody goes off on a wild tangent quite like Robin. We just turn on the camera, ask a question, and let him rip. Do you know how much easier that makes our jobs?"" Asner said she ""can't wait"" for an upcoming interview with Williams for her Revealed series. ""What do you think he'll riff on instead of answering my questions?"" Asner said. ""Mike Tyson? Duct tape? Michael Jackson? Viagra? Monica Lewinsky? Enron? John Wayne Bobbitt? All seven? Lord, let it be all seven.""""s","entertainment, celebrities, media, news, vol 39 issue 09, entertainment"

3500,Alaska-Yukon Moose Dimly Aware Of Drew Barrymore's Career Path,"YUKON TERRITORY'In an impressive display of the star's reach, a team of University of Calgary zoologists announced Monday the discovery of an Alaska-Yukon moose with a ""faint but definite"" awareness of the career arc of Drew Barrymore. ""This moose is a magnificent specimen,"" said Dr. Joseph Hardenbrook, who came across the animal in the remote North Yukon while conducting field research on the migratory patterns of the species. ""It is remarkable for the enormous antlers it sheds every year, its ability to subsist on twigs and aquatic plants, and its faint cognizance of Barrymore's short-lived marriage to Canadian comic Tom Green."" According to Hardenbrook, the 1,100-pound moose, a member of the family Cervidae, species Alces alces, exhibited a basic level of familiarity with the dramatic ups and downs of Barrymore's professional and personal life. While, for example, it did not know about her infamous on-air flashing of David Letterman, it knew about her nude Playboy spread. The moose, Hardenbrook said, also seems to be aware of Barrymore's red-hot romance with Strokes drummer Fabrizio Moretti. ""I was talking to [fellow scientist] Paula [Angell] about the rumors that Drew is getting engaged to that Strokes guy, when the moose started turning its head,"" Hardenbrook said. ""At first, I assumed that the head-turning was part of an effort to detect the scent of wolves and other potential predators, but subsequent tests revealed that the moose knew about the Barrymore-Moretti relationship and, presumably, wanted to join in the conversation."" Study co-chair Andrew Sheehan said the moose knew that Barrymore starred in E.T. at 7, and that she began abusing drugs and alcohol soon after. It did not, however, know the specifics of her substance abuse, including the fact that she had her first drink at age 9, and first tried marijuana at 10 and cocaine at 12. While it vaguely recalled that Barrymore had written an autobiography at age 14, it could not remember the book's title, Little Girl Lost. ""There definitely were things this moose didn't know,"" Sheehan said. ""It had no idea that Steven Spielberg is her godfather and had forgotten that, after years out of the spotlight, she made her return to public consciousness in 1992's Poison Ivy. It could, however, name five of her movies: E.T., The Wedding Singer, Scream, Poison Ivy, and Charlie's Angels. Not too shabby for an animal that lives 250 miles from the nearest town."" Sheehan called the moose's familiarity with Barrymore ""impressive, but not a total aberration."" ""Although this level of celebrity awareness is unusual, it is certainly not without precedent in the animal kingdom,"" Sheehan said. ""There have been documented cases of lower invertebrates that were aware of Celine Dion's moving struggle to get pregnant, as well as Komodo dragons that knew about George Clooney's long, hard road to the top of the acting heap."" The scientists hope to continue studying the moose. ""Assuming we get funding, we'd like to gather long-term, longitudinal data, ideally over the course of the next five to ten years,"" Hardenbrook said. ""We think we can learn a great deal from this beast about the dissemination of celebrity news among non-primates. What we learn could revolutionize the fields of zoology and infotainment science."" At last sighting, the moose was foraging for food in the harsh winter landscape while gearing up for Barrymore's upcoming blockbuster sequel Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle.","entertainment, celebrities, animals, news, vol 39 issue 08, entertainment"

First, he was a scruffy turn-of-the-century gangster with a heart of gold in The New York Gangs. Then, he transformed into a 1960s con artist with a heart of gold in Catch HimEE Please! I can't say for sure how good these movies are, but they are definitely at the top of my must-see list. (Oh, in case you weren't sure who I meant by Leo, ""s Leonardo DiCaprio. Leo is short for Leonardo.) I'm not ashamed to admit that when I heard Friends was coming back next year, I leapt around my apartment like Ross' monkey Marcel.

I know Ashron Kutcher is a celebrity, because I hear him mentioned all the time, but I'll be darned if I can put the name to the face. The Fox network is at it again!

Twenty-five women will compete for the affections of a single strapping construction worker with'get this'$50 million! Cha-ching! And even though this idea sounds a lot like The Bachelor Show, I've heard Fox has some sort of surprise twist ending. Well, whatever it is, I'm just happy to see Hollywood getting back to what it does best: giving true love a chance to bloom. Speaking of The Bachelor Show, someone should give the first girl who lost another chance at romance. She was so special. Just like basketball, football, and trout seasons, Awards Season is now upon us, so get your hot dogs and score cards and prepare for some hard-hitting awarding. A word to the Academy: bring back Billy Crystal! Item! There's a new film about a piano-playing Holocaust survivor in Poland, and it's been getting a lot of critical acclaim. It's directed by Roman Polanksky, who's best known for What Ever Happened To Rosemary's Baby? Roman seems to be getting a little more personal in this one, and I love it. I wish he would make more movies back in the old U.S. of A. After 9-11, we could use someone like him back on our shores. Attention Jackie readers! Does anyone know when the new Star Trek movie comes out? It's an even-numbered one, so it should be great. Item! Sabrina The Teenage Witch is now going to be Sabrina The Teenage Wife! That's right, actress Melissa Joan Hart got engaged to a rocker recently. I'm not sure what band he's with, but they must go down like honey since he snagged the honey-blonde thespian! Hey, I just thought of this: If Melissa Joan Hart married somebody with the last name ""Attack,"" she'd be Melissa Joan Hart-Attack! That'd be a hoot. Say, did anyone catch Man Vs. Beast on Fox? Boy, was it something! SPOILER ALERT: If you don't want to know who won what, you should skip ahead to the next item. Are you all gone? Okay. First, the Japanese eating champion was no match for a grizzly bear when it came to eating 60 hot dogs. Nor were 44 little people a match for an elephant when it came to pulling a jumbo jet. But striking a blow for the humans was grand-master Gary Kasparov, who narrowly defeated a wild boar in chess. Just when I've lost faith in Fox, they pull out a show that answers a big ""what if?"" for every American. Item! Some people say Dr. Phil is a straight shooter. Me, I've always found him rude and unsympathetic. According to some reliable sources, though, Dr. Phil is a Gloomy Gus because his wife nags him from the moment he steps in the door to the moment he goes to sleep. So next time he lays into a guest on his show, I guess I should be a little more understanding and realize where that anger comes from. Item! I called to order my tickets to see Saline Dion perform at Ceasar's Palace In Las Vegas, and after just 75 minutes on hold, I got through. Let me just say that March 26, 2005, cannot come fast enough. If you happen to be there that night, look up to row YY, seat 81, and you'll see one very happy man.

3523,'Beltway Sniper' Video-Game Release Delayed Out Of Respect For Victims,"REDWOOD CITY, CA'Video-game developer Pixxel Arts announced Monday that it will delay the release of Beltway Sniper: Silent Strike out of respect for the victims of the recent D.C.-area shootings. Based on the sniper attacks linked to suspects John Muhammad and John Lee Malvo, Beltway Sniper: Silent Strike was slated to hit store shelves Nov. 15. Last Friday, however, Pixxel top brass made the decision to postpone the game's release until March 2003. ""Upon discussing the matter internally, we decided that it would be inappropriate to unleash the intense sniping action and white-knuckle stealth gameplay of Beltway Sniper at this time,"" Pixxel Arts president Davis Conway said. ""Out of respect for the victims of this horrific killing spree and their loved ones, we are delaying release of the mind-blowing first-person shooter until early next year."" According to Rich Koslow, editor of GamePro magazine, Beltway Sniper: Silent Strike was expected to be one of the hottest video-game releases of the holiday season. Available for Nintendo Gamecube, PlayStation 2, Xbox, and PC, the game enables players to wander through an ultra-realistic suburban D.C. landscape shooting innocent passersby. ""Beltway Sniper is everything you've heard and more,"" Koslow said. ""I recently had a chance to play it myself at Pixxel's offices, and it's as close as you can come to real-life experience short of actually being Muhammad or Malvo himself."" Despite the strong buzz surrounding the game, Conway said Pixxel Arts is committed to holding off releasing Beltway Sniper ""until the wounds from the tragedy have begun to heal."" He stressed that the delay has nothing to do with any problems with the game itself. ""I want people to understand that the delay is strictly a product of our deep and profound compassion for those affected by this tragedy,"" Conway said. ""The game itself is ready to go and, believe me, it more than delivers: The mind-blowing, fully rendered 3-D graphics feature both first- and third- person modes, and the special SneakScope View enables players to track their targets with deadly precision while still keeping an eye out for police. Once enough time has passed and we as a nation have put these events behind us, I am confident that gamers will find the strength to move on to more than 20 thrilling levels of stealth-shooter action."" Though disappointed by the delay, software programmers at Pixxel Arts fully support the decision. ""This was clearly the right thing to do'it's just too soon,"" programmer Russell Sperber said. ""No one is ready for the realistic wound-channel modeling or rifle-bullet ballistics right now, but by the time March rolls around, they'll go nuts over it. That and the unlockable extra levels, the 'Create A Cryptic Note' feature, and the 'Play As The Cops' mode. And, of course, we'll be expanding the Create-A-Sniper feature, in which you can put yourself or your friends in a tree outside a strip-mall parking lot and take aim at the customers exiting such stores as Ponderosa, T.J. Maxx, and Jo-Ann Fabrics."" As new details of the sniper case unfold, Pixxel Arts has agreed to work in tandem with D.C.-area law enforcement. ""We've been in regular communication with the various police forces involved in the case,"" Conway said. ""They've been very helpful, both with regard to how to respectfully approach this event and how to make the gameplay as realistic as humanly possible. In situations like this, it's crucial that you do things right."" Conway said that a percentage of the profits from sales of Beltway Sniper would be donated to the victims' families.","entertainment, crime, video games, news, vol 38 issue 42, entertainment"

3537,Who Will Bring Closure To A Grieving Nation?,"NEW YORK'On Sept. 11, 2002, Americans will sort through emotions ranging from anger to grief, pain, and a profound sense of loss. But while the day will surely be difficult to endure, it remains unclear which television network will rise to the occasion, with its sensitive, cathartic anniversary coverage helping us decide what to feel while bringing a sense of closure to our national period of mourning. Will it be a major network like CBS that heals us, salving our wounds with its around-the-clock, Dan Rather-hosted coverage? Or will it be a cable channel like CNN, its crack team of veteran telejournalists guiding us to a place of rebirth and renewal as only a 24-hour news network can? Or will it be a surprise young upstart like MTV, speaking to our hearts in a way foreign to its stodgier counterparts? ""When we're doing our jobs right, we're not merely reporting the news; we're helping viewers cope with the grief and pain in their lives,"" ABC News president David Westin said. ""That is one of the central purposes of any newsgathering organization, and never will that be clearer than on Sept. 11."" ""Now more than ever, we are a nation undivided,"" Fox News Channel senior producer Tom Bird said. ""From the simple farm houses dotting the Iowa countryside to the condominium complexes of Los Angeles to the rustic cabins of Cape Cod, on the anniversary of the terrorist attacks, Americans will be huddled in front of their TV sets to assuage their grief and testify to their patriotism. And Fox News Channel will be right there with a shoulder to cry on."" All told, an estimated 800 hours of Sept. 11 retrospectives, memorials, and clips packages will air on more than 50 channels, including TNN, ESPN, and Oxygen. An estimated 200 million Americans are expected to tune in to at least some portion of the day's programming. Diane Blauvelt, whose husband Nathan died in the attack on the Pentagon, said she looks forward to the all-day coverage. ""It's been an incredibly hard year for me,"" Blauvelt said. ""At times, I didn't think I could endure the grief. But I kept telling myself, 'Diane, just hang on until this coming Sept. 11, and the networks will make it all better.' That's the only thing that got me through."" GETTING THROUGH IT
Dr. Andrea Herman, a University of Maryland psychiatrist and licensed grief counselor, has developed the following set of guidelines to help Americans get through the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks:
Remember that you are not alone. An estimated 150 million people will be watching the three major networks.No one channel is the ""right"" one to watch. Find the programming that is best for you and believe in your choice.Look to your elders. Find comfort in the wisdom and guiding hand of experienced leaders like Dan Rather, Tom Brokaw, and Peter Jennings.Take a break. If non-stop television coverage becomes overwhelming, you may need to get away by occasionally checking out a game show or sitcom rerun.Turn to your community for support. Tune into local news coverage, as well as national news programming.Seek out your peers. Get support from niche-oriented networks with which you personally identify, such as BET, Lifetime, or MTV.If needed, seek therapy. There is no stigma attached to turning to a counselor like Dr. Phil for help. Added Blauvelt: ""I can't tell you how healing it will be to once again see that footage of the smoldering Pentagon where my Nathan died."" ""We as a nation need to experience some sort of closure,"" said Marcy McGinnis, CBS senior vice-president of news coverage. ""And no one needs that more than the people who lost loved ones on Sept. 11. They will never forget what happened, but they need to move on and feel whole again. They need the sort of tasteful tribute montage set to Bruce Springsteen's 'Empty Sky' that we've got planned at CBS."" ""How are we to memorialize an event of such unspeakably horrific proportions?"" Fox News senior producer Jeff Kent asked. ""How can we eulogize those whose deaths we can scarcely comprehend? Well, Fox is giving it a shot with the two-hour special The Day America Changed. I think you're going to like what you see."" In what may be the most touching display of caring, ABC News anchor Peter Jennings will host a question-and-answer session for children. ""Just imagine how confusing this all must be for the children,"" Westin said. ""Thank goodness Peter will be there for them, from 3 to 4 p.m. EST."" Lawrence Crouch, a media-studies professor at Syracuse University, said the Sept. 11 anniversary coverage will stand as a shining example of the healing power of television. ""Will the answer to the nation's woes come in the form of a CNN special memorializing that tragic day? Or a Katie Couric interview with an emotional Rudy Giuliani, live from Ground Zero?"" Crouch asked. ""Are our hours of personal reflection better spent ruminating on the fate of those lost by watching an interview with a firefighter's widow, or by celebrating our living heroes with a rousing musical salute? It's a toss-up, but my money is on NBC's Concert For America. I understand they have Alan Jackson on board."" According to NBC News senior producer Alan Koslow, TV news plays a vital role in Americans' lives. ""In the past, someone like Walter Cronkite merely informed. But in this day and age, Tom [Brokaw] and his fellow news anchors do so much more,"" Koslow said. ""They function as parent, friend, teacher, social worker, grief counselor, and spiritual advisor. That's a lot of pressure considering they also have ratings to think about."" ""Some people ask how a bunch of network executives can decide whether America should continue to mourn or get back to regular life,"" Koslow continued. ""Well, it's very complicated and involves a lot of research and data the average person would never understand."" One of those average people, Chicago-area homemaker Adrienne Coffey, said she knows exactly where she will be at 8:46 a.m. on Sept. 11. ""I want to share the day with others who are feeling what I'm feeling,"" Coffey said. ""I'm going to be right there in front of the TV.""","entertainment, tv, terrorism, news, vol 38 issue 32, entertainment"

3540,Magazine Announces Plans For Special 'Sex Issue',"NEW YORK'In an unprecedented move that has sent shockwaves through the magazine industry, Jane announced plans Monday to publish a special ""Sex Issue."" ""When the editorial staff got together to plan our next issue, somebody jokingly suggested devoting an entire issue to sex'a 'sex issue,' if you will,"" said Jane Pratt, editor-in-chief of Jane, a monthly magazine geared toward hip 18- to 32-year-old women. ""After the laughter died down, the room fell silent for almost a minute. It was clear we'd stumbled onto something."" Founded in 1997, Jane has featured articles about sex in previous issues. But never before has it'or any other magazine'published a single issue featuring so many articles on the subject that it could only be called ""The Sex Issue."" ""The issue will contain all sorts of articles about sex, written by women who've had sex, for women who've had sex,"" Pratt said. ""No doubt, some people out there will think we've gone too far, but we here at Jane have never been afraid to be provocative and really shake things up."" ""This is real,"" Pratt continued. ""This is what happens between the sheets. Everyone talks about sex behind closed doors. We thought it was time to break down those doors and bring it out into the open."" While the full content of the issue has not been revealed, Pratt mentioned several of the articles that made the final cut. Among them are ""What He's Really Thinking About Your Body,"" ""Seven Ways To Make Him Scream,"" and ""The 'Big O': A How-To Guide."" ""I promise you this is going to be a wild ride,"" Pratt said. ""One of our reporters is doing a story about the 'ins and outs' of vibrators, and another is actually reviewing porn. That should really ruffle some feathers within the more conservative quarters of the magazine world."" Added Pratt: ""Some [of our readers] might be a little put off by the idea of an entire 'sex issue' at first. But if they just give it a chance, I'm confident they won't be able to put it down'until their boyfriends get home."" In spite of the enthusiasm among Jane staffers, the decision to publish a sex issue was not an easy one. ""Initially, we were afraid our advertisers were going to shy away from this,"" advertising director Corinne McHugh said. ""It turns out, they were all crazy for the idea. We had to double our page count just to keep up with the ads that came flooding in.""

3543,Substance-Abusing Star's Publicist Has Been To Hell And Back,"MALIBU, CA'Sara Baumann, who for seven nightmarish years was trapped in the powerful grip of client Matthew Perry's drug and alcohol dependency, has ""come out the other side, stronger than ever,"" the 33-year-old publicist said Monday. Sipping a Diet Coke while curled up on a couch in her Malibu home, Baumann reflected on those dark days of drug busts, car crashes, and tabloid spin control. ""Drugs, drinking, rehab, bad relationships, arrests'I've been through it all,"" Baumann said. ""But, thank God, all that's finally in the past. And you know what? I'm a better publicist for having gone through it. The lessons I've learned about shaping how the public perceives a celebrity client, I'll have those for the rest of my life."" Through the good and the bad, Baumann has stood by Perry, issuing official post-rehab press statements, doing damage control after relapses, and enduring countless lunches with reporters and producers in an effort to manipulate their opinion of the troubled Friends star. ""It's hard to talk about some of the things I went through,"" Baumann said. ""The Vicodin addiction, the smashed Porsche, the Hazelden stintEE so much of that time is just a blur to me.""aumann, who ""never expected this wild ride,"" came from humble roots, raised by schoolteacher parents Bob and Annette Baumann in Easton, PA. After graduating from Boston University with a degree in psychology in 1991, she moved to Los Angeles to become a publicist. She landed the Perry gig in 1995. ""The peak of all the madness was probably around 1997,"" Baumann said. ""There I was, this simple girl from Easton, PA, and all of a sudden, my client's picture is appearing in all these magazines'People, Us Weekly, EWEE you name it. His fame really went to my head. Looking back, I guess the crash was inevitable.""he first cracks began to show in late 1997, when Perry entered a rehab hospital for chemical dependency. Baumann said she was in ""deep denial"" about his drug troubles, repeatedly issuing statements quashing tabloid rumors that Perry had damaged his liver so badly that he needed a transplant. As Perry bounced in and out of rehab, and his name became a staple on late-night talk-show monologues, Baumann found herself sinking deeper and deeper into depression. The stress began to take its toll on her health. ""Everything was so out of control,"" Baumann said. ""I didn't have time to go to the manicurist, much less my power-yoga class at Reebok [Sports Club]. I put on eight pounds. I looked like shit."" Fortunately for Baumann, a good friend stepped in to provide a much-needed wake-up call. ""Liz [Cohen] said to me, 'Sara, you need to do something for yourself. Not for Matthew, but for you,'"" Baumann said. ""She convinced me to check into a spa. I did a lot of serious thinking during my 48 hours in the desert. While lying there in that full-body seaweed wrap, I gained an entirely new perspective on what I was doing to myself."" Baumann emerged from the spa with a determination to get better press. Presenting Perry's troubles as the ""early stages of chemical dependency, not addiction,"" Baumann sought the public's admiration for his courageous admission of fallibility. She was largely successful, landing Perry a sympathetic cover story in USA Today. Encouraged by the USA Today success, Baumann decided that it was time to start focusing on the positive. ""In February 2000, Matthew did this L.A. Times interview, during which he said he was fed up with the whole Hollywood dating scene and was looking for a girl who has more going for her than just looks,"" Baumann said. ""You know, the standard I-want-somebody-who's-real stuff. At one point, he said he wanted a girl who was into regular things, like playing bingo. He said, and I quote, 'Bingo is sexy.' By 9 a.m. the next day, I had that line on the desk of every entertainment editor in the country. According to our clipping service, it appeared in print or on air in 63 different places. For me, that was the moment I knew I'd turned the corner."" But the fight was not over. When Friends co-star Jennifer Aniston married Brad Pitt, Baumann dug deep within herself to find an angle to advance Perry's career. ""I sent out a story about how Jennifer's wedding inspired Matthew to quit partying and start looking for someone he could build a life with himself,"" Baumann said. ""I couldn't believe how well that worked. The press ate it up."" Today, with the media focusing on Perry's recovery and his recent slim-down, Baumann said she's ""mellower and definitely happier."" This calmer version of Baumann stands in stark contrast to the harried, perpetually angry person she used to be'someone who would scream at talk-show bookers on her cellphone or bully young personal assistants. ""I'm more mature now,"" Baumann said. ""My attitude is, whatever craziness comes my way, I can handle it. Except, like, another arrest. Oh, God, please don't let him get busted for possession.""rrff","entertainment, celebrities, perspectives, news, vol 38 issue 27, entertainment"

3547,You Must Romance The Music Out Of The Tambourine,"My lord, what are you doing? Your crude handling of that beautiful instrument borders on the obscene! You cannot carelessly strike a tambourine and expect it to sing its beautiful song. You must coax it out of her. You must romance the music out of the tambourine. The way you strike that tambourine makes me cringe with horror and disgust. Would you strike a beautiful woman? Of course not. You would gently stroke her, caress her, whisper sweet nothings in her ear. So, too, you must with the tambourine. Tell the tambourine you love her, and your reward will be a beautiful music. Treat her roughly, and she will slap you in the face with her velvet glove. The tambourine can be deceiving. True, she has a taut skin and round figure like the drum, but that is where the similarity ends. Take your finger and run it along her edge. There. Do you feel it? Little miniature cymbals! Thatf that is the secret of the tambourine. If you gently tap her, the little cymbals will sing the body electric. If you clumsily hit her like your fingers are sausages and your hands spicy hams, she will recoil in disgust. Make no mistake, this is a courtship. A grand design of love. You must carefully woo the tambourine to make her do your bidding'and not through deceit or treachery. To a tambourine, what matters most is honesty. Your playing must come from a place that is pure and true. You cannot play the tambourine one shake at a time, preventing her from stretching her long legs and reaching her natural, majestic stride. You must think three shakes ahead, but still live wholly in the moment, adjusting your movements to her mercurial moods. Only then will you prove yourself worthy of the tambourine's affections. Take in the wholeness of the tambourine. A tambourine is an endless river of mystery. There is a depth there that most men do not see. They see only a noisemaker, some paper horn with streamers or a metal box that clicks noisily when you spin it around. But those are for little boys, not men. Do you want to be a little boy playing with a toy? Or do you want to be a man with a muse? If you wish the latter, then you must surrender yourself to the tambourine completely. She will not be deceived by pretenders. She will only bear her fruits to those who devote themselves fully to the task of tilling her fertile soil. The tambourine has an endless bounty of love to offer, but you must first favor her with your own affections. Do not clutch her as a baby does a rattle. Grip her firmly but knowingly. Tap her lightly with your finger. I said lightly, you buffoon! Try again. There. Does she not coo for you now? The timbre of the tambourine should set the stage for romance, but only if you draw it out with patience and sensuality. Banging her repeatedly, as you were just doing, produces music unfit for a tableau of fez-wearing clowns in tiny cars. Now comes the question: What is your endgame, O wooer of the tambourine? Do you shake her for her sex appeal? Have you seen men playing tambourines on stage, using them to attract painted women in short skirts, and decided that you, too, would like to use the tambourine to attract a painted lady of your own? Then you love the tambourine for all the wrong reasons. Lay her down gently and walk away. You are among the undeserving. Do not feel alone. Most are undeserving. But if you are pure of heart and prove yourself worthy of her considerable charms, the tambourine will treat y","opinion, entertainment, music, commentary, vol 38 issue 23, pierre henry, entertainment"

3550,General Mills' Star Wars: Episode II Cereal Gets It All Wrong,"Talk about disappointing. I waited years for Star Wars: Episode II cereal, and now that it's finally here, it'sEE this. To call this cereal a letdown would be an understatement. From the light-saber marshmallows that look more like tulips to the lame ""venture game"" on the back, General Mills' ill-conceived Star Wars: Episode II cereal gets it all wrong. Maybe it's my fault. I got myself so psyched in the days leading up to the cereal's release, I couldn't help but be a little disappointed. I shielded myself from spoilers as best I could: I knew it would be corn-based and that there would be, among others, R2-D2-shaped pieces, but not much else. I worked ahead so I could get May 10 off from work, and I was first in line when the IGA opened. I ran giddily to the cereal aisle and proudly'proudly!'bought two boxes, one of each of the two collector's-edition designs. Trembling with excitement, I ran home and cranked up John Williams' score. I sat down at my kitchen table and gazed at the front of the box, from which the visages of Anakin Skywalker, Senator Amidala, and Count Dooku stared back at me, almost daring me to take a bite. I poured myself a heaping bowl and, with unbearable anticipation, took my first taste of the first new Star Wars-themed cereal in almost 20 years. Let me backtrack here for a minute. The year is 1983. I am 11 years old, and Kellogg's C-3POs have just hit the market. With my allowance money, I buy my own personal box, because there was no way I was sharing one with the rest of the family. That very first bowl opened my eyes to a thrilling new world of space-fantasy-themed breakfast foods. What I found inside that box was a wonder to behold. Sublimely delicious oat, wheat, and corn pieces'no marshmallows or raisins or anything. None were necessary, as they would only get in the way of Lucas' vision. This was no ""part"" of a complete breakfast, but a complete breakfast in and of itself! You took one bite and said, ""There's a galaxy-spanning saga of rebellion and romance in my mouth!"" On top of that, on the back of the box was a cutout mask of one of six Star Wars characters. That was a fucking cereal. I finished that box in one day and soon started washing cars to buy more. By the end of the week, I had all six masks and got a good start on the box variations. A buddy of my cousin worked at the IGA, so he got the promotional standee, the lucky bastard. I'm an adult now, but that magical ""Summer Of C-3POs"" will always be a cherished memory. I can still recite the commercial from memory: ""Twin rings fused together for two crunches in every double O."" That was back when George Lucas could do no wrong. Flash-forward to May 10, 2002. I'm sitting at the kitchen table, staring into a bowl of sweetened corn puffs and marshmallow pieces, and I'm not sure what to tell you. Yes, it's sweet-tasting. We knew it would be sweet-tasting. The puffs are small, uniformly shaped, sugar-glazed corn spheroids. Looks like Kix, tastes like Cap'n Crunch. If I were blindfolded, I doubt I could have told you this was meant to be a Star Wars: Episode II cereal. And those R2-D2 marshmallow pieces that were so heavily hyped? I can't even begin to convey how little they resemble the droid. Poor R2 looks like a cross between Inky from Pac-Man and a stick of roll-on deodorant. I realize it's not always easy to produce a reasonable facsimile of a person or object when you're reducing them to a tiny morsel of corn starch and gelatin, but it doesn't look like General Mills was even trying. The Slave I marshmallows are, quite possibly, even worse. Not only is it shaped like some sort of bizarre, melted anvil, but its coloration does not even remotely resemble the blue-gray steel of Jango Fett's trusty ship. Instead, the marshmallow is neon-green with a wild swirl of electric blue. That's just lazy cerealmaking, plain and simple. Did the folks at General Mills even bother to watch any of the Star Wars movies? From the looks of this sugary abomination, it sure doesn't seem so. Now, I assure you, there is no bigger Star Wars fan than me. But no one can convince me that this cereal isn't just something George Lucas threw together for his kids. That's what it all comes down to in the end. If George Lucas could, I bet he'd go back in time and digitally remaster the ""Rebel Rocket"" toy premium out of C-3POs because it's too violent for his children. (As if a toy rocket could be too violent for a war-themed cereal.) I guess that's just how the business is nowadays, all marshmallows and foil boxes. You can't even get a cereal made unless you attach it to a big-ticket summer release, then drop to your knees and lick General Mills' boots. I don't want to get into a whole drawn-out debate about this. I'm 30 years old and am too busy to spend hours arguing with the fanboys on the General Mills message boards who automatically embrace this as the Second Coming of Cheerios. But I am chagrined, make no mistake. If I had the chance to speak to George Lucas, I would strongly urge him to sit down, eat two big bowls of C-3POs, and remember how he used to do it. And I'm never trusting Harry Knowles again. He likes every damn cereal.ss","opinion, entertainment, commentary, vol 38 issue 21, terry sabol, entertainment"

3552,"Look Out, Corporate America, Here Comes My Pirate Radio Station","If, like me, you're among the thinking few, you're pretty disgusted with what passes for radio these days. Turn anywhere on your FM dial, and you're likely to hear the sound of some enormous multinational media conglomerate anesthetizing the masses with its spoon-fed pablum. From Hot 96 to Z-104, these stations are all the same: pre-packaged, focus-grouped DJs selling a bill of false goods to lobotomized teens who don't know the difference between revolution and repetition. Even non-commercial, so-called ""public"" radio is just a cog in the Great American Money Machine. Well, I, for one, have had enough. It's time to shake up the status quo and put a little fear in the heart of the Establishment. Yes, consider this an official declaration of war: Look out, Corporate America, here comes my pirate radio station! Last Friday, Radio Free Tate, the city's first and only broadcast forum for the disenfranchised voices of the country, went on the air. Located somewhere between 89.5 and 91.3 FM, Radio Free Tate is going to let corporate America have it with both barrels: the truths they're afraid to say and the songs they're afraid to play. I may not have the broadcast range of a big station, but I compress a whole lot of rebellion into a six-block radius. You'd better believe this mouse is going to roar. And, unlike the rest of the world, I'm not interested in feeding my audience a steady diet of nothing. While most radio listeners are complacently soaking in the latest teeny-pop brain sedative or the semi-digested pap of the Tweedledee & Tweedledum Morning Zoo show, I'm out there telling it like it is. I'm not afraid to talk about the class war against the poor, the deplorable state of popular music, or the sham election that put Dubya into the Whitewash House. Corporate America, you'd better watch your backside, because there's a new sheriff on your radio dial! I had no idea starting a pirate radio station would be so easy. All I needed was a microphone, a PLL transmitter, a Comet antenna, a 20-watt dummy load kit, a 6-watt amplifier, some old Minor Threat and Bad Brains records, and a self-constructed broadcast booth in my basement. It's so simple, I'm surprised more people don't do it. Then again, how many people have the guts? After all, I'm living outside the law. I know for a fact that the government and the corporate fatcats would love to shut me down. They don't want people to hear what I'm dishing out. Well, tough! I'm going to bring The Man to his knees, one song at a time. A bunch of my friends have already said that when they're in my neighborhood, they keep their radios tuned to Radio Free Tate. You're probably thinking they're just saying that because they're my friends, but they're not. Where else are they going to hear Black Flag's ""TV Party"" followed by a scathing anti-PepsiCo editorial followed by Gang Of Four's ""Guns Before Butter""? On K-Rock? I think not. A desperately needed home for alternative ideas, Radio Free Tate will provide a forum for the forumless, a voice for the voiceless. I tried doing a call-in segment last Saturday, but the masses weren't quite ready for it after spending so many years imprisoned in corporate radio's shackles. (A case of Stockholm Syndrome if there ever was one.) All I got were two 12-year olds making fart noises with their hands and requests for (ugh) Ja Rule and (double ugh) Nickelback. Clearly, these people are so hooked on the Pop Narcotic, they lack the faculties to appreciate my blend of hardcore punk with take-no-prisoners commentary on Generalissimo Bush's real motivations for the so-called war on terror. When I'm not shooting truth straight from the hip, I'm getting down. While much of the playlist is drawn from classic SoCal and D.C. punk, you'll hear everything from Roky Erickson to Neu! to Burning Spear. I throw in some old-school hip-hop, some No Wave, a little spoken word, and some free jazz. Once, I played the entire Tony Conrad box set as a big ""fuck you"" to all the mainstream DJs who are too chickenshit to play experimental composers. And, once in a while, I take a cue from rap pioneer DJ Cool Herc and mix it up by ""scratching"" my records. Try finding that on your average station! I'd encourage all of you to tune in to Radio Free Tate. Like I said, it's somewhere between 89.5 and 91.3 on your radio dial'depending on which side of Maplewood Street you're on. Before long, you'll be able to find our listening area simply by paying attention to who suddenly goes through a political revival. They'll start using less, caring more, and voting with their hearts and minds rather than their wallets. And they'll be listening to the best mix of music you won't hear anywhere else. Find that neighborhood, and you've found Radio Free Tate. Oh, and one more thing: Corporate America can suck it.","opinion, entertainment, economy, commentary, vol 38 issue 20, tate ainsworth, entertainment"

3556,Handlers Desperate To Prevent Tara Reid Political Awakening,"LOS ANGELES'Tara Reid's agent, publicist, and other members of her management team are working feverishly to avert a potential political awakening in the 26-year-old actress, sources reported Tuesday. ""Thus far, Tara has been blissfully oblivious to world affairs,"" said Rick Stein, Reid's agent at International Creative Management. ""But we must remain ever-vigilant of the possibility that, as her star continues to rise, she will develop a political consciousness like so many others in Hollywood."" ""As bad as she is, could you imagine if, during an interview for a new movie, she started going off on saving the animals or ending world hunger or something?"" Stein said. ""So long as she's my client, I will do everything in my power to ensure that this never happens."" The star of such films as American Pie, Josie And The Pussycats, and National Lampoon's Van Wilder, Reid is a fixture on the L.A. party circuit. She also achieved a measure of notoriety in tabloids and on gossip pages last year following her broken engagement to MTV VJ Carson Daly. Though there is no indication that Reid takes an interest in politics or current events, or is even registered to vote, Stein and his associates are keeping an eye out for telltale signs of nascent awareness of social issues. ""I was having lunch with Tara the other day, and she told me she was thinking of becoming a vegetarian,"" said Libby Winters, Reid's publicist. ""I thought, 'Oh, fuck'[personal assistant] Kimberly [Braterman] didn't screen Tara's mail thoroughly and let a PETA mass-mailing slip through.' So I casually asked Tara where she got that idea. She said she was at a party with [socialite] Paris Hilton, and Paris told Tara that her boyfriend said her pussy juice tasted better after she quit eating red meat. I can't tell you how relieved I was."" Winters went on to note that while Reid frequently practices yoga'widely regarded as a ""gateway exercise"" to spiritual and political awareness'the activity has not had any such effect. Reporting regularly to Reid manager Kevin Adrian, members of the actress' entourage are under strict orders not to expose Reid to politically suggestive material. They have also been instructed to inform Adrian of any action or remark which may indicate an emergent social consciousness on the part of Reid, however embryonic or misdirected. Reid's hairstylist, Frederic Chukka, recently became alarmed when she asked him if the hairspray he was using was ""environmentally friendly."" ""At first, I didn't know what to say,"" Chukka said. ""I stammered something about the government banning all that fluorocarbon stuff in the '70s. Tara gave me this look like she didn't quite believe me. I said to myself, 'Think fast, Frederic, if you want to do her hair for next year's Golden Globes.'"" Continued Chukka: ""So I said to Tara, 'Even if they didn't ban all that stuff, no one cares besides a couple of ugly, mousy hippie bitches who are just jealous of rock-star babes like you. You deserve to shine, sweetheart. Besides, I can't think of a better product to give you that just-been-fucked look.' She just nodded."" The handlers' vigilance has extended into Reid's acting choices. Adrian said he encourages his client to play mainly sexy, lighthearted, apolitical roles. As an added measure, he counts on Reid's personal assistant, Kimberly Braterman, to ensure that the on-set environment is politics-free. ""There was a lot of concern when she was cast in Dr. T And The Women,"" Braterman said. ""[Director Robert] Altman is known for his subversive, countercultural views, and [co-star] Richard Gere is a passionate advocate for Tibetan independence. It was a dangerous situation to put her in, but by keeping Tara's trailer far away from Richard's and by frequently pulling her off the set for premieres, press junkets, and racy pictorials for Stuff magazine and Maxim, we managed to shield her from any potential indoctrination."" One Hollywood celebrity who has openly condemned Reid's handlers is actress Jaime Pressly, star of Joe Dirt and Tomcats. ""It is just so unfair,"" Pressly said. ""Because of her control-freak handlers, Tara will never learn of the joys and rewards of political awareness. Since my own awakening last year, I feel so much more full of knowledge and awareness, and I think celebrities should use their fame to educate the public about important issues. Like, for example, did you know that women in Pakistine have to be buried alive with their dead husbands, whether they want to or not? That is so wrong.""

3561,Why Do Porn Actors Have To Use Such Foul Language?,"Like many people, I enjoy pornographic movies. But I've got a major bone to pick with the actors. It's gotten to the point where you can't watch a porno without being inundated by swearing. I can't tell you how many times I've tried to enjoy a hardcore sex scene, only to have it ruined by the participants screaming, ""F' my p'"" and, ""Oh, yeah, suck my big, hard you-know-what, baby."" Is it really necessary to resort to such foul language? It would be one thing if the potty-mouthed performers were just the men. Everyone knows men, especially creative types like actors, can be a little rough around the edges. But, sadly, most of the cussing comes from the ladies. From the moment the delivery man unzips his fly to the moment he finishes all over her face, every word out of these ladies' mouths is ""F' this"" and ""F' that."" Can't I make it through a single triple-penetration scene without hearing things like, ""F' my tight C-word with your huge blankety-blank, you big, black you-know-what""? The swearing isn't limited to the lovemaking scenes, either. It's everywhere. If a fellow is playing a hard-boiled private eye sent to investigate a strip club, you'd better believe he's gonna drop a few F-bombs while interrogating the club owner. Thankfully, my husband Marv fast-forwards through the plot so we don't have to hear any more vulgarity than is absolutely necessary. Whatever happened to subtlety and innuendo? Back in the old days, people in the movies conveyed their lascivious thoughts with a smile, a wink, or a certain look. If you found yourself bent over a breakfast bar in a see-thru nightie, and a rugged, sweaty electrician walked in, it didn't take a stream of four-letter words to encourage him to make love to you from behind. Just the look in your eyes would tell him, ""I bet you have a large ding-dong. Put it in me."" Don't these filmmakers realize that an actor can easily get his or her point across without dirty words? If, for example, a woman wants to fellate a gentleman caller, she can simply say, ""I want to suck on your dingle."" Or ""Can I please lick your winkie?"" That's so much preferable. If I ever used that sort of coarse language around Marv, he'd be shocked and turned off. He wouldn't respect a gal who didn't have the decency to use proper English when she wanted him to stick his business where the sun doesn't shine. And I can't say I blame him. Sometimes, I think these porn actors just weren't brought up right. Believe me, I know how tough it is to raise kids. Kids are exposed to bad language everywhere these days. But you can bet that when my boys ask their girlfriends to spread their hoo-hoos wider, they do it without all the vulgarity. It doesn't come easy or without a lot of soap, but that's the price you pay to raise children you can be proud of. Porn actors have a responsibility to their younger fans. There are impressionable young kids watching these videos, and the people up there on that screen need to be aware of that. They need to realize that the things that come out of their mouths have as much of an impact on those kids as the things that go in them. Perhaps some of these folks need to go back to acting class and learn to not say the first expletives that enter their heads. Since when did panting or screaming, ""Oh, my goodness!"" or ""My word!"" not satisfactorily convey sexual excitement? It was good enough for my generation, and it should be good enough for the people of today. Ultimately, it's not the actors who need to be taking responsibility. It's the studios. They're the ones who are truly in a position to do something about this ever-worsening problem. I've been writing letters to leaders of the adult-movie industry for years, asking them to tone it down or release special-edition tapes for viewers who'd like to enjoy the sex without having to put up with all that cussing. It wouldn't be difficult: The vocals for many of these movies are re-recorded later in a studio, anyway. So far, my efforts have been for naught. I've written the president of Wicked Pictures five times already, but have gotten no response. Same thing at Vivid Video. Someday, I'll win this battle. But in the meantime, I've decided I'm no longer putting up with it. Next porno I rent, I'm going to turn down the sound and turn up the hi-fi playing a nice bossa-nova record. I'll watch, but I won't listen.","opinion, entertainment, commentary, vol 38 issue 15, maggie lehman, entertainment"

But seeing you walk out of the theater the moment the credits start to roll, well, it really hurts my feelings. I may not have been the director or one of the stars of Changing Lanes, but I worked very hard in my capacity as assistant to Mr. Affleck. Did you ever stop to think that behind every name on that movie screen is an actual human being? Did you think second-assistant ""b"" camera Allan Katz was a fictional character? Were you under the impression that key mod technician Fred Newburn is not a flesh-and-blood human with loved ones? I realize that in a major motion picture like Changing Lanes, the credits are pretty long. But is five extra minutes sitting in a comfortable movie theater too much to ask to make someone feel better about their work and their life? I don't mean to come off like a martyr. I didn't have the hardest job in the world. As big stars go, Ben Affleck is a really easygoing, down-to-earth guy. But even the best of actors can have their moments. I won't get into any particulars, but it got pretty hairy during those final days of shooting. There were moments when I got pretty down on the whole Hollywood thing. But when I saw my name up on the big screen for the first time, a feeling of pride surged through me. I thought, ""I guess it really is worth it. I mean, there's my name, up there on the screen. For a brief moment, millions of moviegoers across the country will see my name and think about my contributions to this film."" How wrong I was. When I looked around the theater I was in, I noticed that no one stayed through the credits long enough to see my name, except for one guy sleeping in the back. Even my mom almost didn't see my name because of people walking in front of her. I thought, no one knows or cares about who I am. When you put yourself out there so much and no one stops to take notice, it really hurts. Is it the end of the world if you don't know that it was Dan Palansky who assisted Mr. Michell in the super-8 segment? I'm not going to lie and say it is. But I will tell you that Dan did a wonderful job, and that his friends were so excited and proud that he was able to work on a big film after years of toiling on little films for bagels and coffee and no health insurance. I was excited for him, too. As long as I'm getting things off my chest, let me tell you something else. We're all pretty sick of the joke, ""Man, that best boy sure was awesome in this movie!"" You probably don't even know what a best boy is. Not that you care, but a best boy is the assistant to the gaffer (the electrician in charge of lighting). The rigging best boy for Changing Lanes was Gene Hoeschen. And you know what? He did do a great job, and he really would have appreciated it if you'd paid him some respect instead of spoiling his big moment by cracking wise. Maybe you could rent the Changing Lanes DVD and watch it at home. That way, you could freeze-frame on the credits and take the extra few minutes to read the names. It's not like you're in a rush to get out of there. You're already home. And if you have a few more minutes to spare, go to the Internet Movie Database (imdb.com) to see what else the people in the Changing Lanes crew have worked on. That way, maybe you can learn a little bit about how films work, in addition to paying a small tribute to those behind the scenes. Tell you what. Just read a movie's credits once, as a favor to me, and see if it doesn't deepen your appreciation of all the work that goes into making a film. I bet it will. Then, next time you see a movie, you can amaze your friends by explaining the various important jobs they miss out on learning about by skipping out on the credits. Go on. I dare you.","opinion, entertainment, commentary, vol 38 issue 14, lori osrow, entertainment"

3578,Actors Decide To Go On With Sitcom Despite Cancellation,"BURBANK, CA'Showing the heart and determination that was their show's hallmark throughout its 13-week run, the stars of NBC's Stop The Presses have decided to go on with the series despite its Feb. 5 cancellation. ""I think all the pieces were in place to make this show a big hit,"" said Troy Drake, who played Stan ""Big Sticks"" Hatch, a former pro-hockey player who moves back to his hometown of Petaluma, CA, to write a sports column for The Petaluma Gazette. ""It just needed more time to jell than the network was willing to give. Well, now we have all the time we need."" Though cancellation ordinarily marks the end of a series, the actors agreed there was still work to be done. ""Every show gets shelved eventually,"" said Drake, speaking from the show's new set in the parking lot of a local Ralphs food store. ""But we couldn't bear the thought of abruptly cutting off all those storylines mid-stream. I think I speak for the entire cast when I say we all want to see if Bill and Andrea will eventually give in to the long-simmering sexual tension between them. And, next episode, Jessie's kooky parents swing by for a visit and wreak all kinds of chaos in her life. And that's pretty scary considering how chaotic Jessie's life already is."" The news of the cancellation was a shock to the cast and crew. No one, however, was more upset than Eddie Whyte, who played Lance Roberts, a cocky, hotshot account executive at The Petaluma Gazette with a weakness for the ladies. Just one week before NBC announced the cancellation, Whyte passed up a sizable part in an upcoming Rob Schneider movie to do Stop The Presses. ""When I found out [about the cancellation], I was devastated, because this was a project I truly believed in,"" said Whyte, rummaging through the cardboard box that is now the wardrobe department. ""Our first 13 episodes really showed progress. We started coming together as an ensemble, and the writing got steadily tighter."" Despite losing their writing staff, directors, producers, camera operators, technical crew, set, props, and wardrobe, as well as a network on which to air the show, the Stop The Presses actors remain optimistic they will succeed. ""We have a remarkable cast with tremendous chemistry,"" said Christine Jagerveldt, who plays Dianne Clarke, the gruff, hard-nosed, secretly lonely publisher of the Gazette. ""That's half the battle right there. And we were always ad-libbing and improvising, so scripts aren't a problem, either."" Added Jagerveldt: ""We don't even think of ourselves as the cast of a weekly sitcom anymore: We're a family. This whole ordeal has brought us closer together than we ever imagined possible."" Drake said he was genuinely surprised when ABC, CBS, Fox, UPN, WB, HBO, Showtime, Cinemax, MTV, VH-1, Comedy Central, Lifetime, Nickelodeon, The Sci-Fi Channel, Bravo, A&E, Home Shopping Network, TV Land, The Discovery Channel, The Food Network, CNN, Oxygen, Noggin, The Cartoon Network, ESPN, and ESPN2 passed on Stop The Presses as a midseason replacement. ""I really thought Telemundo was going to bite,"" Drake said. ""Or [local cable-access channel] 97. But if nobody wants the weekly dose of livin', learnin', and laughin' that Stop The Presses provides, that's fine by us. This is going to be a breakthrough year for Stop The Presses'mark my words. If the networks and their hundreds of syndicated affiliates don't want to be a part of it, screw 'em."" Asked why the cast plans to continue with a show that had neither viewer nor network support, Drake cited a few of his favorite moments from Stop The Presses. ""Remember the episode where tart-tongued copy editor Patti got her hand stuck in the photocopier?"" Drake said. ""Or the one where Bill and Andrea got stuck together in the elevator? There have been a million moments like that, and from what I've seen of this new season, there are going to be a million more."" Bloodied but unbowed, the Stop The Presses cast is certain that the show will have a long and successful run. ""We're all excited and optimistic about what lies ahead,"" Drake said. ""Barring a rash of heavy rain showers, we just might have an Emmy-winning season on our hands.""","entertainment, tv, news, vol 38 issue 05, entertainment"

3588,"Children, Creepy Middle-Aged Weirdos Swept Up In Harry Potter Craze","HOLLYWOOD, CA'Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's Stone, the hit film about an orphaned boy and his pals at Hogwarts School Of Witchcraft And Wizardry, continues to break box-office records, casting its magic spell over children and creepy middle-aged weirdos alike. Just ask Corey Molland, a Downers Grove, IL, 11-year-old who made his own Harry Potter costume, complete with Nimbus 2000 broomstick, to wear to the film's opening night. ""I've seen the movie four times already,"" Molland said. ""And I want to go see it again tomorrow."" Or Corey's neighbor, Kurt Furmanek, an unmarried 40-year-old who has seen the film 11 times, always in a homemade Ludo Bagman costume. ""It's terrific, as good as I'd hoped,"" said Furmanek, munching from a bag of Bertie Botts' Every Flavor Beans while waiting in line at a local multiplex Monday. ""Granted, it's not perfect: They left out a number of key scenes and characters, like the second Quidditch match and Peeves. And some of the details were off, like how they said the boa constrictor was from Burma when it was from Brazil. But all in all, it's remarkably faithful."" There are many possible explanations for Harry's broad appeal: a troubled world's need for a little bit of magic, the way the franchise taps into powerful good-versus-evil mythologies, the chance it offers overweight 47-year-olds to retreat from their dreary adult lives into an idealized fantasy childhood. But whatever it is that makes us wild about Harry, one thing is clear: The fantastical universe created by author J.K. Rowling speaks to the child in all of us, whether young or way too old. You can see it in Lisa Werner, a Pueblo, CO, 13-year-old who has read all four Harry Potter books three times and keeps an ever-growing scrapbook of magazine articles related to the books and films. ""Harry Potter books are the ultimate books ever!"" Werner said. ""I wish there were real chocolate frogs that jumped when you tried to eat them."" And you can see it in Denver's Lynne Ritchie, a childless, 42-year-old legal secretary who named all six of her cats after students in the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff houses. ""I had my doubts when I heard that Chris Columbus was chosen to direct, but I have to hand it to him,"" said Ritchie, who owns more than 150 Harry Potter toys, including the hard-to-find Powercaster Electronic Spell-Casting Playset. ""He did a great job bringing Rowling's vision to the screen, particularly the Quidditch match and the living paintings at Hogwarts. I can't wait for Chamber Of Secrets."" Maybe it's Harry's underdog qualities that make him so appealing. Or maybe it's the way wondrously magical things seem to burst from every page that makes the books so compelling to the likes of San Diego's Gary Minton, 41, who appeared as ""Harry Potter Geek"" on a recent episode of Comedy Central's Beat The Geeks game show. ""There's never been anything like Harry'it's simply a phenomenon,"" said Minton, creator of the ""Unofficial Hermione Granger Fan Page"" and whose house neighborhood children have been warned never to enter. ""And the movie is perfect, especially the casting of Emma Watson as Hermione. She's even prettier than I imagined. I hope she reads the Hermione Granger fan fiction I sent her."" Child-development experts and arrested-development experts agree that Harry Potter's impact on society has been enormous. ""What J.K. Rowling has done to foster literacy in a world where it was declining so steadily makes her a true hero,"" child psychologist Dr. Sandy Wexler said. ""But for adults, it's a different story. Retreating into a child's fantasy world is one of the most distressing preliminary signs of becoming unhinged, even when the books are as richly imagined and engrossing as the Harry Potter series."" Added Wexler: ""Incidentally, do you think Snape is a Death Eater? I know he helped Harry out in Book One, but I have this theory.""","entertainment, kids, movies, sex, books, harry potter, news, vol 37 issue 44, entertainment"

""In just the song 'Ten-Inch Pierogie' alone, he uses the word 27 times."" In an official statement, MC Krakow defended his use of the word: ""When I say, 'Y'all be my Polacks,' or 'Yo, what up, Polack?,' it's my way of taking the word back.

3593,"Ah, The Beauty Of The Fall TV Season","Is there anything that compares to the majesty of the fall TV season? In late October, when the last of the repeats fade into darkness, it's time to pour a cup of hot tea, pull a favorite blanket up over your knees, and sit back and watch the network programming change. What a welcome relief it is after all those oppressively hot months of sizzling summer blockbusters! Sure, the summer movie season, with its exciting trips to the multiplex and dramatic box-office showdowns, has its charms. But by the time the fall season rolls around, I'm good and ready for a break from all that. Fall is when the colors of my Sony 36-inch TV really come alive. There's so much beauty to behold during the fall TV season: the deep brown of Jessica Alba's hair, the vibrant red and amber hues of Kelsey Grammer's sweater vests, the rustling of Calista Flockhart's skirts. Every year, there are those moments that are absolutely breathtaking, those special times you wait for: the familiar lilting strains of Peter Boyle's voice on Everybody Loves Raymond, the gradual unveiling of a new subplot on Law & Order, the crisp, cool air emanating from ER's Anthony Edwards. Everything is so magical in the fall, you hardly know where to turn your eyes. Should it be to ABC's The Drew Carey Show? Or to The West Wing on NBC in the same time slot? There are scarcely enough hours in primetime to enjoy it all! Fall is also the time to reap the benefits of all the seeds planted so carefully in the spring. This year, we found out who the father of Rachel's baby is on Friends, and that Buffy is no longer dead. After months of anticipation, it was worth the wait. Speaking of waiting, there's less of it during the fall than at any other time of year. Happily, with the days getting shorter, the prime-time lineup comes earlier and earlier each day. You get home from work, turn on the TV, and, before you know it, the Third Rock From The Sun syndicated rerun is over, and primetime programming has fallen upon the land. While much of the joy of the fall season is seeing the TV seasonal cycle completed with the return of all your favorite shows, fall also affords the opportunity to experience the wonder of the new. Shows like The WB's Smallville, NBC's Crossing Jordan, CBS's The Guardian, and ABC's My Wife And Kids were all welcomed into the world this fall. There's nothing quite like that first taste of the fresh faces the fall has to offer. For some, the fall is synonymous with hunting season. These adventurous types love searching through TV Guide, never knowing what exciting made-for-TV movie or miniseries will jump out at them next. Meanwhile, for the little ones, the fall season holds no shortage of excitement, either. What child doesn't look forward to all that Halloween fun, from the It's The Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown special to the The Simpsons' Halloween spectacular, not to mention all the fun commercials for candy and costumes? And, lest you think things peak in October, the fall season gets even better come late November. That's the time of year when, after some shows have flown south, and the dead series have fallen from the line-up, a peaceful calm falls over TV land. There's no longer any movement of shows from time slot to time slot. You'd be hard-pressed to find a better time for TV-star-gazing than a clear, static-less November night. Looking up from my couch to see the bright faces of Will And Grace's Debra Messing and The District's Craig T. Nelson, well, it almost chokes me up. It is important, though, to remember that fall is not entirely about relaxation and fun. Fall is the time for storing up for the long winter ahead. I've been working hard every day, setting the VCR to tape shows like Inside Schwartz, The Bernie Mac Show, and The Ellen Show before they wither and die, lost forever.","opinion, entertainment, tv, weather, commentary, vol 37 issue 43, bridget cascoli, entertainment"

3595,I Do So Adore The Adult Theatre,"Ah, the adult theatre! As a discriminating patron of the adult arts, nothing compares to a night out enjoying the lights, glamour, and pelvic gyrations of the adult theatre. Each performance is a glorious release, filling me with the joy and elation that only high smut can deliver. Let me describe my perfect Saturday evening to you. It starts off with an early dinner, followed by a Bud tall boy or three. Then, it's off to the adult theatre to delight in some hot, throbbing facial action. Nothing could be more satisfying! If done properly, the adult theatre lifts the soul, frees the spirit, and engorges the genitals. Yes, only the adult theatre can transform the dull routine of the Everyman into something magical through staged acts of moaning, heaving, and fucking and sucking. By any chance, did you happen to catch the Chrysti & Sindi Sextravaganza at Club Platinum last Thursday? Spectacular! Truly a night to remember. The musical numbers were exquisitely choreographed, as if angels themselves had descended from above to guide the action. Ever graceful, Chrysti glided gracefully up and down the brass pole to the strains of Mystikal's ""Shake Ya Ass."" And Sindi? Oh, she was magnificent! From the moment she took the stage, a vision in rhinestone pasties, she held everyone transfixed. I don't exaggerate when I say she brought the house down with her show-stopping lollipop number. But the third act was the true coup de grace: Their bodies intertwined in sapphic splendor, Chrysti and Sindi wowed the crowd with their human-totem-pole trick. It was almost more than I could bear""E a feast for all the senses! Those who think adult theatre is only for those upper-crust types who attend live dramatic performances are quite mistaken. The adult theatre is for everyone, and it thrives in any number of formats. Much like an official cast recording can bring home all the magic of a Broadway musical, the adult theatre can be enjoyed at home with videotapes. In fact, many of the best adult dramatic productions are exclusive to home viewing. Take, for example, Motel Sex, starring adult-theatre legend Asia Carrera. You could never find a production like that mounted onsta"". The reason is simple: In order to capture the essence of a motel, it is necessary to use a real motel, and no stage set can achieve the level of verisimilitude demanded by adult-theatre connoisseurs. Oh, there are those purists who say you cannot duplicate the adult-theatrical experience within an electronic medium, but I say home viewing, when done properly, is every bit as good as a live show. There are those who charge that the adult theatre is superficial. They claim it's all artifice, nothing but a lot of sturm und tang with no real substance undergirding it all. These so-called ""critics"" are sorely misinformed. If only they would let go of their conventional, preconceived notions of what ""good theatre"" is, they would see the beauty and timelessness of such tales as Cum-Crazed Slurp Sluts Vol. 14.

3597,Terrorism Storylines Being Added To TV Shows As Quickly As They Were Dropped,"LOS ANGELES'Less than two months after frantically excising any allusions to terrorism, network executives are scrambling to add terror-related storylines to TV shows, sources reported Monday. ""We're working around the clock to squeeze in a special episode where a Libyan with ties to Al Qaeda threatens to blow up the D.A.'s office,"" said Law & Order producer Dick Wolf, who on Sept. 15 scrapped an episode of the NBC drama in which a character utters the word ""bomb."" ""We've got to stay on top of this thing."" Next week, Spin City, which last month pulled an episode featuring a shot of the World Trade Center, will air a ""very special"" one-hour episode in which Mayor Winston is infected with anthrax.","entertainment, tv, trends, terrorism, news in brief, vol 37 issue 39, entertainment"
3598,Tom Clancy Treated Like He's Some Kind Of Terrorism Expert,"WASHINGTON, DC' Tom Clancy, bestselling author of such military thrillers as The Hunt For Red October and Patriot Games, is being treated like an actual terrorism expert, having offered his opinion on Larry King Live and countless other TV shows since Sept. 11. ""The Al Qaeda network is known to have operatives in at least 30 countries, including the U.S. and Great Britain,"" said Clancy, a former insurance broker and avid wearer of naval-warship baseball caps, during a recent Nightline. ""By the way, Ted, Stephen Ambrose's The Wild Blue is a terrific read."" Later that evening, Clancy appeared in a Crossfire panel on biological warfare with former CIA director John Deutch and Secretary Of State Colin Powell.","entertainment, terrorism, news media, books, news in brief, vol 37 issue 38, entertainment"
3599,Just Shoot Me Writer Assumes Everyone He Meets Watches Just Shoot Me,"LOS ANGELES'Andy Kaminowitz, 31, a staff writer for the popular Thursday-night NBC sitcom Just Shoot Me, operates under the assumption that everyone he meets watches the show, sources revealed Monday. ""It's kind of weird how he thinks everybody should be familiar with his work,"" said Frank Scalia, a bartender at Dublin's, a Sunset Boulevard bar frequented by Kaminowitz. ""He'll walk in, strike up a conversation with somebody, and casually bring up that he's a writer for Just Shoot Me. Then, he just sits back with this air of expectation, like people are going to have all these questions for him about specific episodes or whatever."" ""I mean, I've seen the show once or twice, and I guess it's all right,"" Scalia said. ""But it's not like I plan my week around it."" According to witnesses, whenever Kaminowitz meets someone unfamiliar with the program, he becomes confused and annoyed, unable to comprehend a world that contains people who are not big Just Shoot Me fans. ""He asked what I thought of the line, 'Man, you pretty uptight'even for a white boy,' that [guest star] Snoop Dogg said when Finch quit working for him in the episode 'Finch In The Dogg House,'"" said Ellen Prior, 44, who sat next to Kaminowitz in a dental-office waiting room last Tuesday. ""I told him I wasn't sure I'd seen that one, but he just went on, saying, 'That line was mine. I didn't get script credit on that episode, but I contributed the best material during punch-up.'"" ""I don't even know what 'punch-up' means,"" Prior added. Kaminowitz, a Harvard Lampoon alumnus, has held staff-writer positions at a number of programs, including VH1's Pop-Up Video and The WB's Unhappily Ever After. After a two-year stint at Win Ben Stein's Money, he was hired at Just Shoot Me in September 2000, impressing producers with a spec script he'd written for Suddenly Susan. Ever since, he's held fast to the notion that people are familiar with and interested in his work on the show. ""I couldn't believe it,"" said Doug Hannisch, 38, a frequent customer at Dublin's, where Kaminowitz is known among regulars as ""that fucking Just Shoot Me guy."" ""I once made the mistake of trying to talk to him about the game, just because I was sitting next to him when Monday Night Football was on. So he says to me, 'You watch TV? What did you think of this week's JSM? The part where Elliott and Finch were razzing Maya about the overpriced imported coffee she bought online? That was pulled straight from real life. That's based on my actual sister, I swear."" ""I was like, 'What the hell is this guy talking about?'"" Hannisch said. ""I mean, 'JSM'? Who refers to Just Shoot Me as 'JSM'?"" Eventually, Kaminowitz got up and moved to another seat near Dan Carter, 41, striking up another Just Shoot Me-based conversation. Upon realizing that Carter was not a regular Just Shoot Me viewer and could not name a cast member besides David Spade, Kaminowitz let out a long, dramatic sigh. ""He looks around the bar in disbelief and says, 'Who doesn't know who Wendy Malick is? Or Laura San Giacomo?'"" Carter said. ""I was like, 'Sorry. Maybe I'd recognize them if I saw their picture. The names don't really ring a bell, though.'"" According to acquaintances of the oft-incredulous sitcom writer, Kaminowitz's distorted sense of the importance of his work dates back to the early '90s, when he was a personal assistant to Ron Wolotsky, then co-executive producer of the HBO comedy series Dream On. ""When Andy got that job, he'd make all these passing references to 'Ron,' as if he expected us know who Ron Wolotsky was,"" said Melanie Myers, 32, an L.A.-area obstetrician and longtime friend of Kaminowitz's. ""It's not like I walk around casually spouting Latin terms for women's reproductive organs and assume everybody's going to understand me."" Neighbor Greg Tan, who has endured numerous Just Shoot Me-related monologues, said Kaminowitz ""doesn't get out much."" ""Andy puts in really long hours at the show,"" Tan said. ""He'll generally leave his house around 9 a.m. and not get back until well after midnight. From what Andy's told me, for some reason, they make those guys work, like, 70 hours a week. Apparently, that's just common practice on sitcoms. I can't understand why: It's not like they're working to cure cancer. They're writing Just Shoot Me, for God's sake.""","entertainment, human interest, people, jobs, tv, culture, news, vol 37 issue 38, entertainment"

3605,A Shattered Nation Longs To Care About Stupid Bullshit Again,"SPRINGFIELD, MO'Were this an ordinary Tuesday night, Wendy Vance would return home from her receptionist job at a Springfield chiropractor's office and spend the evening engaged in any number of empty, meaningless diversions: watching old, taped episodes of Friends, browsing the new issue of Cosmopolitan, or driving to Center Square Mall to browse for shoes. Tonight, however, the 29-year-old is unable to bring herself to turn on the TV or even half-heartedly flip through the new Pottery Barn catalog. Instead, she has decided to visit her grandmother in nearby Mountain Grove. ""If none of this had happened, right now I'd probably be watching that stupid Journey VH1 Behind The Music episode for the 40,000th time. Or talking to my friend Kerri about the Gap skirt I want,"" said Vance, holding her grandmother's frail, time-worn hand. ""Now, all I can think about is how precious life is, and how important it is to spend quality time with the people who matter to you, because everything could change in an instant."" Added Vance: ""I just want my regular life back."" Vance is not alone. Shaken by the tragic events of Sept. 11, people across the nation have abandoned such inconsequential concerns as the Gary Condit scandal and Britney Spears' skimpy outfit at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards. No longer are they talking about shark attacks or what's-his-name, that Little Leaguer who was too old to play. Instead, they're focusing on the truly important things in life: friends, family, and being good to one another. How long can it go on like this? Three weeks after the horrific attacks that claimed more than 6,000 lives, many Americans are wondering when their priorities will finally be in the wrong place again. Some are wondering if their priorities will ever be in the wrong place again. ""In the aftermath of this horrible tragedy, people find themselves cruelly preoccupied with the happiness and well-being of their loved ones, unconcerned with such stupid bullshit as the new Anne Heche biography or Michael Jackson's dramatic comeback bid,"" said Dr. Meredith Laufenberg, a psychologist and family therapist at UCLA Medical Center. ""Who knows how long it will be before things are back to normal?"" Reading a book to his 7-year-old nephew, Adrian Mauer of Chicago echoed Vance's longing for banality. ""I don't even know what happened at the Daytime Emmys, much less the Latin Grammys,"" Mauer said. ""How could these monsters do this to us? Is nothing sacred? It makes me want to enlist in the Marines and slash bin Laden's fucking throat from ear to ear."" According to Laufenberg, Mauer's anger is a natural response to the current situation. ""Across America, there is a profound sense of grief for the victims of this tragedy,"" Laufenberg said. ""But there is also a profound desire to inflict great pain upon its perpetrators, to make them pay for taking away our ability to get way, way too into the McDonald's Monopoly game."" Even as America's television networks slowly return to regular programming, the vital issues of our pre-Sept. 11 lives are relegated to the background. ""If Access Hollywood would just go back to blathering about Julia Roberts' surprise platinum-blonde makeover and Brad Pitt's new dog and a bunch of other crap that doesn't matter in the least, I'd know everything is right with my world,"" said Shelley Orr, a Stockton, CA, data-entry clerk. ""Oh, my God, what's going on with the whole car-phone controversy? Are they going to ban them? I haven't even thought about it in weeks."" Laufenberg and other therapists are seeing countless cases of Sudden-Reality Shock Syndrome (SRSS), a disorder affecting those suddenly and violently re-grounded in the real world. Crisis and grief-counseling centers across the nation are offering therapy groups for those who need to discuss their newfound inability to care about mass-market crapola. According to Iris Huffman, emergency-services director at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute, the key to enjoying vapidity again is to extract oneself from the hard realities of the world very slowly. ""The instinct is to immediately throw yourself back into your regular daily routine, but this isn't always best,"" Huffman said. ""Allow yourself time for a gradual return to the petty, shallow, meaningless little life you led before this horrible tragedy. I'm telling my patients: Don't go see Zoolander until you know you're actually ready."" According to Georgetown University history professor Timothy Schuitt, our interest in stupid bullshit is what makes America great. ""The United States is a free country, a strong country, a prosperous country,"" Schuitt said. ""Many veterans gave their lives so we would have the right to focus our attention and energies on the DVD release of Joe Dirt, the latest web-browsing cell phones, and how-low-can-you-go hip-hugging jeans. It is a sign of our collective strength as a nation that we genuinely give a shit about the latest developments in the Cruise-Cruz romance. When Mariah Carey's latest breakdown is once again treated as front-page news, that is the day the healing will have truly begun."" While Schuitt says he is optimistic that Americans will one day obsess over stupid bullshit like they used to, others are not so confident. ""This is a life-changing, society-altering catastrophe of the first magnitude, on par with a Pearl Harbor or Great Depression,"" said noted historian and author David Halberstam. ""The sad truth is, this country may never go back to caring about pointless, inane trifles as we once did."" Where have you gone, J. Lo? A nation turns its lonely eyes to you.","entertainment, patriotism, trends, terrorism, michael jackson, news, vol 37 issue 35, entertainment"

3610,Tow-Truck Driver Has Great Idea For Tow-Truck Movie,"BUTTE, MT'Bob Beresford, a tow-truck driver with 11 years of experience at Central Montana Service & Salvage, announced Monday that he has a great idea for a tow-truck movie. ""I don't know why, but most people really don't have that clear a picture of what tow-trucking is all about,"" said the 44-year-old Beresford, standing in front of his 1995 Ford Super Duty. ""They don't realize the integrity, the commitment, the strong sense of duty that go into this work. With Towtruckin', I have a chance to change all that."" Towtruckin', according to Beresford, is ""a classic David-versus-Goliath story."" Its hero, ""Rob Relesford,"" is a gifted, idealistic young tow-truck driver trying to make it as an independent operator in the highly competitive world of towing and recovery. Faced with competition from Towco, a massive, multi-state towing corporation, Relesford must choose between continuing to eke out a lonely but proud existence or accepting a well-paid position on the Towco payroll. In the end, the choice is clear. ""At the end of the movie, there's a big, overturned tractor-trailer across the highway, and the hot-shot Towco guys won't move it for insurance-liability reasons,"" Beresford said. ""Then, the hero steps forward and tows the wreck off. Not because he's a show-off, but because he has to. It's just what he does."" Beresford said he hasn't fully developed the plot of Towtruckin'. He has, however, worked out certain scenes, such as the one in which Relesford pulls a beautiful waitress' 1984 Sunbird off the median and gallantly refuses to accept payment. ""Rob is a real American hero,"" Beresford said. ""He's out there with his wrecker all hours of the day and night, ready to right a tipped truck or haul a stalled vehicle to a mechanic. He's the closest thing to the cowboy we have left these days. But the point is, if something needs to be towed, by God, he'll tow it."" ""To me, that's America in a nutshell,"" he added. Though Beresford plans to paint Rob as something of an outlaw, he said the character's actions will always fall on the side of what's right. ""Rob would never tow away an illegally parked car unless it was impeding or inconveniencing honest citizens,"" Beresford said. ""And he'd only tow repossessed cars of bad guys and wealthy gangsters, not poor people trying to make ends meet. Rob's like Robin Hood with a winch."" Beresford said he will likely incorporate his own personal experiences into the film. ""There's going to be this old tow-truck driver who serves as Rob's mentor and teaches him everything he knows about tow-trucking,"" Beresford said. ""That's based on Red Stampfel, the guy who was boss here when I started in '89,"" Beresford said. ""He was like the Yoda of Central Montana Service & Salvage: Boom tow, high-line towing, righting a chassis, Stampfel knew it all. He died of a heart attack in '96. In the movie version, the guy dies, too, but Rob continues to talk to him after he dies."" Added Beresford: ""Also, there'll be this girl who, at first, doesn't get why towing's so important to Rob, but eventually she comes to understand. That, of course, is like [Beresford's wife] Melanie."" Beresford is confident in his vision for Towtruckin', describing it as a ""can't-miss"" concept. He does, however, fear that the film could be ruined by studio executives who don't fully ""get it."" ""There's a right way and a wrong way to do this film,"" Beresford said. ""One of the wrong ways would definitely be to make a big deal out of the truck. Don't get me wrong, this guy'll have a nice rig, like the three-axle Ford Super Duty I drive at Central Montana. But I could see some Hollywood type putting him in a big 30-foot rollback tower with all these extra hydraulics and a crewcab and that kind of crap. That's not how it should be done. Towtruckin' is all about the tow trucker, not the tow truck.""","entertainment, human interest, movies, jobs, poor, news, vol 37 issue 31, entertainment"

3613,Helvetica Bold Oblique Sweeps Fontys,"LOS ANGELES'Helvetica Bold Oblique was the big winner at Tuesday's 73rd Annual Fonty Awards, taking home 11 statues, including those for Best Sans Serif and the highly coveted 2001 Best Font prize. The gala event, attended by the biggest names in the publishing and graphic-design worlds, was held at the Shrine Auditorium and followed by a post-ceremony bash at the recently refurbished Linn Boyd Benton Printing House. ""A million thanks to all the wonderful folks in the font community who believed in Helvetica Bold Oblique,"" said an ecstatic Oliver Rudd, designer of the font, in his acceptance speech. ""Without your faith in my vision, I would not be here before you tonight. I'd also like to thank Helvetica Regular designer James T. Helvetica, the giant upon whose shoulders I stand. And, of course, the designers of the Visa Card Terms & Conditions booklet, who brought my font to the forefront of the American typeface scene this year."" With its victory, Helvetica Bold Oblique takes its place in a long line of Fonty-winning Helveticas. In the awards' history, three other variations of the typeface have won Best Font: Helvetica Condensed Light in 1960, Helvetica Ultra Compressed in 1981, and Helvetica Black in 1988. ""The Helvetica font family is highly respected throughout the publishing world,"" said Bruce Chizen, president and CEO of desktop-publishing giant Adobe Systems. ""Boasting an unequaled range of weights and widths, literally everybody wants to work with it."" The Fontys, awarded annually by the Academy Of Fonts & Typefaces, recognizes superior achievement in the field of typography. Winners receive a Fonty statue, a golden ""F"" elegantly styled in freeform. Awards in 41 categories, including Best Slab Serif Font (American Typewriter Medium), Best Monospaced Font (Letter Gothic Slanted), and Best International Font (Fusaka Regular), were presented during the live, three-hour CBS telecast. Technical subcategories, such as Best Transitional Serif (Apollo Roman) and Best Mathematical Symbol (Lucida Math Symbol) were presented in an untelevised ceremony last week. ""This is the one night of the year when the entire font community, from typesetters to PostScript designers, comes together to honor and celebrate its own,"" said Bob Helger, legendary designer of 1990 Best Font winner Utopia Italic. ""You could feel the electricity in the air."" Despite the plaudits heaped on Helvetica Bold Oblique all night, some questioned the academy's choice. ""A bold as Best Font?"" said Christopher Rankley, editor of Typography Today. ""They may as well have handed the award to Chicago, for God's sake. Or, better yet, Chicago Shadow Underline."" Rankley said he was rooting for the more traditionally tooled Palatino'which snagged just one award, for Best Display Font'to take home top honors this year. ""Palatino is one of the most popular Oldstyle revivals in existence, blending classical Italian Renaissance letter forms with the crispness of line needed for 20th-century printing processes. Yet it has never won Best Font,"" Rankley said. ""I think a lot of Palatino fans out there were thinking maybe this would be the year."" A common criticism of the Academy Of Fonts & Typefaces is that it is out of touch with the cutting edge, favoring fonts with mainstream, commercial appeal. Academy members have little awareness, detractors say, of today's more challenging fonts, such as the daring, highly ornamental Blackletter. William Perez, a lifelong font enthusiast and editor of the 'zine Lorem Ipsum Dolor, is one such critic, calling the Fontys ""embarrassingly conservative and tradition-bound."" ""They think they're being daring when they nominate a font like Techno or Comic,"" Perez said. ""What about totally innovative fonts like Critter, with its cute, smiling animal faces rendered into letters, or Giddyup, in which each letter is styled out of a curling lasso? These fonts don't even exist to the high-and-mighty Academy."" Perez is not the first to note that quirky, independently distributed typefaces rarely earn Fonty recognition. In the rare instances when cutting-edge fonts are nominated, they are typically relegated to the Best Decorative Font category. Such was the case with the bitstream release Eyeballs, which was nominated for Best Decorative Font but lost out to SnowCap, a long-entrenched favorite of the bagged-ice industry. Defending his group's choices, Academy president Jack Tolleson said: ""A small, independent font like Goudy Text is masterfully rendered, but it simply does not carry enough national importance to warrant nomination. We cannot justify presenting an award to a font that is barely available for viewing by the public, showing up at only a handful of renaissance fairs across the nation."" Despite such disagreements, no one objected when this year's show closed with the presentation of a Lifetime Achievement Award to Times New Roman, a proportionally spaced typeface designed in 1931 for The London Times. When the son of the font's deceased designer, Stanley Morrison, took the stage, the entire room rose in a standing ovation. ""Such strength of line, such firmness of contour, such economy of space,"" said Tolleson, his voice wavering with emotion. ""I doubt there will ever be another font like Times New Roman.""","entertainment, patriotism, books, innovation, news, vol 37 issue 30, entertainment"

3616,Mary-Kate Olsen Is Dragging Ashley Down,"Mary-Kate Olsen. I don't even know where to begin. Can Mary-Kate really be the incomparable Ashley Olsen's twin sister? They may have the same genetic code, but Mary-Kate certainly does not have her sister's prodigious dramatic gifts. For eight years on Full House, the pint-sized duo shared the role of Michelle Tanner. But, despite their identical outward appearance, it was easy to tell which sister was Michelle at any given moment. I cringed whenever Mary-Kate would appear on my TV screen, her clumsy, ham-fisted portrayal of the littlest Tanner devoid of all nuance and depth. And her incompetence was laid all the more bare by her sister's mastery of the role. The twins' post-House work only widened the gap. Over the course of countless children's sing-along videos, TV movies, and such sitcoms as Two Of A Kind and So Little Time, it's been made painfully obvious who's got the chops and who doesn't. Ashley is George Michael to Mary-Kate's Andrew Ridgeley. She's Daryl Hall to her sister's John Oates. Yes, it's clear that Ashley Olsen is the one with the true talent and personality. She is the majestic airship hovering in the sky, while Mary-Kate is the oppressively heavy, rust-encrusted anchor to which that airship is cruelly tethered, preventing it from ascending high into the firmament. Ashley could be another Hepburn, another Streep, if not for the cumbersome ballast that is Mary-Kate. Examples of Mary-Kate's incompetence are as abundant as blades of grass. Space limitations force me to restrict my examples, yet the handful I have selected are nevertheless damning: Mary-Kate lacks charisma. That elusive quality is vital to a performer, yet Mary-Kate is almost completely devoid of it. With her vanilla features and expressionless, fish-eyed gaze, one must wonder why this singularly untalented waif was ever placed before a camera. Case in point: In 1995's ""The Case Of The Sea World Adventure,"" from the direct-to-video children's mystery series The Adventures Of Mary-Kate And Ashley, Mary-Kate delivers such lively and toothsome lines as, ""The pearl necklace must be in that bucket of baitEE yecch!""ith about as much élan as a TV agribusiness reporter delivering the day's livestock quotes. If she required guidance or inspiration, she need only have turned to Ashley, whose unmasking of the jewel thief was as suspenseful as the climax to any classic 1940s film noir. ""Trenchcoat Twins,"" indeed. Mary-Kate's diction is poor. Another acting skill so vital, yet so utterly lacking in Mary-Kate, is clear enunciation. Her high-pitched, reedy, mealy monotone seems oddly out of place coming from her ponderous maw. Yet, like the call of the shrike, it pierces the eardrums and inspires profound irritation. This paucity of resonance applies to her singing voice, as well, and is readily apparent in the girls' 1994 recording, ""Brother For Sale."" No amount of studio wizardry could conceal the cracks in her off-key, phoned-in ""singing."" It was clear she didn't believe in the song. Meanwhile, Ashley's hearty vocals and peerless phrasing were reminiscent of a brilliant prodigy of yesteryear, Judy Garland. Whereas Ashley sang from her diaphragm, Mary-Kate's voice seemed to emanate from a tinny transistor radio with a dying battery. Mary-Kate is not as good-looking as Ashley. Mary-Kate's disheveled rat's-nest hairdo looks as though it has never experienced a comb or shampoo. She never seems to have a straight part, and the fussy little barrettes stuck randomly throughout her hair only accentuate its unruliness. Her wardrobe, from To Grandmother's House We Go to Billboard Dad, has always been tacky and dowdy, inspired by some bizarre Schoolmarm Chic trend that exists only in her head. By contrast, Ashley is a heavenly apparition. Her strawberry-blonde mane falls in glossy ringlets, her well-scrubbed skin radiates a golden, healthy glow, and her erect bearing exudes a sylph-like grace, giving her a larger-than-life appearance despite her diminutive frame. Her fashion instincts are as unerring as Mary-Kate's are clueless. Mary-Kate could also stand to lose a few pounds. I say these things not to humiliate Mary-Kate. It is altogether likely that the girl possesses talent'just not in an entertainment-industry capacity. Perhaps, after extensive training and a long probationary period, Mary-Kate could make a serviceable cashier, nursing-home orderly, or cafeteria worker. Or maybe she could serve as an assistant to Ashley'a star of her sister's magnitude surely needs someone to answer her fan mail, clean her trailer, and fetch her bottled water. I fear that if Mary-Kate is not forced to relinquish her partnership with Ashley, the duo will eventually go down in a blaze of mediocrity. Their careers will become mired in a bog of formulaic sitcoms, forgettable TV movies, and mindless, mercenary merchandising peddled to the lowest common denominator. And that will be a real shame, because the girls have so much to offer. Well, Ashley does. Mary-Kate, please do your twin a favor: Set her free to soar like the eagle she is. Only when she is loosed of the sisterly bonds that hold her down can Ashley assume her rightful place in the pantheon of greats.

3621,CNN Should Be Named The Crappy News Not-Work,"Cable News Network? Yeah, right. Nice try, Ted Turd-Burglar. Your channel should be called the Crappy News Not-work. Because that's what it is'crappy and not even news. CNN is so retarded. They totally have no editorial vision. And they're always trying to act so cool. Like, 'Oooh, Darth Vader is our announcer!' Whoop-de-doo. Did Darth Vader break any new developments in the Chandra Levy case? I didn't think so. And who does CNN have for a network-defining anchor? Lou Waters? Puh-leez. Dweeb-o-rama. I was a better anchor than him back when I was on The Today Show, which is basically all CNN Today is, 'cause it's so stupid. Okay, ready? This is how Lou Waters does the news: 'Doyyy, I'm King Retard, and this is the Retard News. Today, the president took a dump. I do not know what happened next, because I can't read, so I will pick my nose now. Doyyyf what delicious boogers! Turning now to the international scene, my butt hurts.' I swear to God, that's him. CNN acts like they're the network of record in Millennial America, just because of their award-winning Gulf War coverage. That was so 10 years ago, and people only watched because there was no MSNBC back then. Oh, and check this out. This past April, I'm at the White House Correspondents Dinner, and CNN White House reporter John King starts bagging on this 'Fleecing Of America' report we did. 'Cause we did this report about these pharmaceutical companies that are getting government subsidies and still charging 1,000 percent markups on pills. So he was all like, 'As big a problem as I have with the major U.S. pharmaceutical companies, I found your report to be unfairly biased in favor of the consumer.' Duh. That was the whole point, Lord Dorkenhumper! If John King is at next year's dinner, there's no way I'm going. Speaking of John King, CNN also has Larry King, who's so old he's probably John's great-grandfather or something. Man, does Larry suck. (Or, suck up, that is.) I mean, hello? It's supposed to be a news network! Not the Blah-Blah-Blah-About-The-Power-Of-Prayer-With-Pat-Boone-and-Kenneth-Copeland Network! Or the I'm-Kissing-Marlon-Brando-On-The-Lips-Total-Stupid-Gaywad-Channel-For-Gays Network. And Headline News? More like Deadline Snooze. How can you even call that news? It's just a bunch of headlines. That is so not news. Oh, my God. I totally forgot. This is totally secret. You did not hear this from me, okay? Maria Shriver told me that Robert Bazell said Lou Dobbs told Roger Cossack that he wants to completely make out with Greta Van Susteren. Can you believe that? Who would want to kiss her? Greta Van Susteren is so totally corroded. And Jeff Greenfield? Doyyy. What is he, my science teacher? That guy is gimpier than John Hockenberry. And more boring, too. Watching cars rust is more exciting than that Greenfield At Large thing. Man, does that show rot.

3625,Four Generations Of Americans Demand Sitcom Reparations,"WASHINGTON, DC'Pressure is building for the nation's TV networks to offer a formal apology and reparations to the four generations of Americans who lost millions of hours to inane sitcoms. ""We, on behalf of this nation's 215 million Telecaust victims, demand extensive reparations from the perpetrators of these heartless and falsely heartfelt programs,"" said Meredith Bishop, 47, president of Americans For Sitcom Reparations (AFSR). ""For hours wasted staring at mind-numbing swill, for idiotic pap promoted as outrageous romps, for an unending parade of very special episodes, season-ending cliffhangers, and celebrity walk-on appearances, we demand justice be served at long last."" AFSR leaders are calling for each Telecaust survivor to receive a minimum of $8,900 for his or her suffering. Under the AFSR plan, an additional $350 million would go toward the creation of a memorial to time killed during the Sitcom Era and toward educational programs designed to raise awareness and help prevent future sitcom crimes. ""The big TV networks can never erase the pain they have caused,"" said attorney Ben Feuerstein, who is representing the American public in what is believed to be the largest class-action lawsuit ever filed. ""But at the very least, they can demonstrate an ounce of regret and repentance for their crimes by compensating those who, for decades, have suffered through everything from Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C. to Herman's Head."" Said Tampa, FL, resident Helen Neimaier, who lost more than 20,000 hours to sitcoms from 1951 to 1998: ""Every night, it was something different, yet completely the same: Mrs. Roper would mistakenly think Jack was giving Chrissie love lessons when he was actually giving her cooking lessons. Or Webster would learn an important lesson about playing with fire. But we were given nothing of substance to watch. And we would go to bed, only to begin again the next night at 8 p.m., 7 Central and Mountain."" Added Neimaier: ""And, oh, the spinoffsEE always, there were spinoffs.""ishop said the AFSR is also calling for the establishment of a special air-crimes tribunal to bring ""every last network executive"" to justice. At last year's Burbank Trials, many major TV producers were tried and convicted, including Garry Marshall, who was executed by firing squad after 20 million witnesses identified his programs from a mid-'70s Tuesday-night lineup. ""The Flying Nun, Just The Ten Of Us, Small WonderEE it is all too easy to forget the crimes of the past,""ishop said. ""If we are to prevent them from happening again in the future, we must keep such atrocities fresh in our minds."" Despite the groundswell of support for reparations, network apologists are proving a vocal group, as well. ""Punishing the networks for the crimes of the past would only serve to reopen the wounds of shame they still feel,"" said Sean Wilheit, professor of media studies at Syracuse University. ""Do you think the NBC executives responsible for The Single Guy are proud of what they've done? Of course not. There's no point in antagonizing these guilt-ridden, basically decent people by continuing to rub their past sins in their faces."" Bishop, however, strongly disagreed. ""We cannot, and should not, erase the scars of the episode of Silver Spoons where Ricky becomes a stand-up comedian,"" Bishop said. ""In fact, we must do just the opposite and remain ever-vigilant, striving to ensure that we stop the Urkels of tomorrow before they gain power. Only by demanding full accountability can we reverse the shameful legacy of man's inanity to man.""""mmT","entertainment, tv, media, television, civil rights, news, vol 37 issue 25, entertainment"

Send armies to intercept me! I welcome the challenge. They may kill me, but I shall not live and miss The Joker's Wild. I do not pay $21.95 a month for basic-cable service so that I can miss the rich palette of knowledge and skill-testing programming offered daily by the Game Show Network, a sumptuous banquet whose main course is the peerless Joker's Wild. Not by half, my friend. Let rains three men deep flood these lands. I care not. I swear I shall be home as the closing credits of the preceding program roll, and by the time the Joker theme fills my living room, I shall be safe and dry in my Barcalounger, sipping a Fresca, awash in every nuance of early-'70s game-show zeitgeist, from horn-driven theme music to sponsorship by Z-Brick and Jules Jurgensen, to the show-capping announcement that this has been a Jack Barry and Dan Enright production. Neptune, send mighty tsunamis to impede my path! Knock down the highest church steeple with 40-foot waves! Drown the crops and livestock! Still will I see whether Gail from Tuscaloosa beat the returning champion, Doug from Berkeley, so many decades ago. Were it not for this week's 39-cent soft-shell taco special at participating Taco Bell restaurants, I would be home even now, mentally preparing myself. But it matters not, for I shall not miss a second of The Joker's Wild. Offer me no Super Password. Do not patronize me with Bullseye or Magnificent Marble Machine. And attempt not to pass off the children's spinoff game show Joker! Joker! Joker! as the genuine article. I demand the original, adult Joker's Wild, preferably from the Bill Cullen years. But be the host Jack Barry or Jim Peck, I shall attend faithfully to each frame of the broadcast. Do plagues ravage the land? I may miss Tic Tac Dough. Has our government collapsed into civil war? Perhaps I will forego Match Game. Perhaps. But though Armageddon sears the Earth, turning forests to ash and cities to heaps of skeletons, I SHALL NOT MISS THE JOKER'S WILD. The strength of 10 is mine, for my quest is righteous. I may never meet the Devil face-to-face, nor defeat him by totaling $1,000 or more in the Big Spin. But should he dare cross my path, I can spit in his eye and skip away gleefully, for he has no domain over me.

3633,Beer Commercials Aren't What They Used To Be,"In these modern times, the concept of workmanship, of taking pride in one's craft, has gone the way of Nagel paintings, the Thompson Twins, and Vision Street Wear. And nowhere is this more evident than in the sorry state of our beer commercials. What? You say the beer commercials of today are just as good as those of the past? Nonsense! Peel back the scales from your eyes and gaze unblinking into the gaping maw of inarguable truth. Let us go back to the 1980s, the Golden Age of beer advertising, to see how far we have fallen. Take the gloriously whimsical Miller Lite campaigns. In one classic spot, comedian Rodney Dangerfield is called upon to win a celebrity bowling tournament. His team implores him, ""We only need one pin, Rodney!"" thereby setting up a moment of high drama. Can lovable loser Dangerfield pull off the seemingly simple task under intense pressure from his middle-aged cronies? Our hero proceeds to roll the ball dead-center down the middle of the lane and, though it appears he is headed for a triumphant strike, in a surprising turn of events, the ball bounces harmlessly off the head pin, toppling not a one and losing the game. This defies our expectations, for we know that a bowling ball is a good deal heavier than a bowling pin. The resultant response of the viewer is one of delighted laughter and merriment. Now, compare this bit of levity to the recent Budweiser campaign featuring the talking frogs and lizards. It is common knowledge that lizards and frogs can't talk, so this freakish defiance of nature's laws provokes a confused reaction. Where did these lizards learn the English language? Where did they pick up the regional dialect? And since when do amphibians of any sort consume beer? How could the producers of these ads expect the public to buy into the ludicrous premise of beer-swilling iguanas with powers of speech? Have the higher minds at Budweiser forgotten their own Spuds MacKenzie, the beer-drinking ""party animal"" of the fraternity Tappa Kegga Bud? Spuds never uttered a single syllable and went on to become an internationally recognized icon of the go-go '80s. Who, meanwhile, cares a whit about the Bud frogs? Nary a soul. And what about human personalities? In the '80s we had Dangerfield, Bob ""I Must Be In The Front Row"" Uecker, Bubba Smith, Ed ""Too Tall"" Jones, Joe ""Python"" Piscopo, and pool-player extraordinaire Steve Mizerak. And what have we today? Those faceless shills who prattle ""Wazzup"" as they remain lethargically splayed on the davenport. Can our beer-commercial standards sink any lower? And what sort of catchphrase is ""Wazzup""? It is not even a proper English word! In my day, the slogans were at least complete sentences, like the poignant, ""It just doesn't get any better than this."" But even phrases that weren't full sentences were infectiously catchy. Sports enthusiasts of today still chant the ""Tastes Great, Less Filling"" slogan of the '70s and '80s. Meanwhile, ""Wazzup"" has already been supplanted in Budweiser ads by the shamelessly derivative ""What are you doing?"" Appalling! Most importantly, to paraphrase Pete Seeger, where have all the hot chicks gone? In the glory days of the beer commercial, we had the Swedish bikini team and the Amazonian babes playing volleyball using the Rocky Mountains as a net. All the recent Corona ads offer is a faceless woman lounging in a beach chair propped up by cell phone. As a male viewer, I want to be reassured that drinking a certain beer brand will make me desirable to supermodels and other unattainable women. Once upon a time, the simple act of cracking open an MGD or an Old Milwaukee held the promise of scantily clad young ladies mobbing a man to bathe in his alcohol-tainted essence, with strains of Eric Clapton's reworked ""After Midnight"" playing in the background. Sadly, an entire generation of boys is now growing up unaware that there exist harsh deserts that, at the twist of a bottle cap, turn into snow-covered party paradises, complete with bikini-clad sex kittens and caravans of 18-wheelers fully stocked with ice-cold Bud. Hear my plea, beer-commercial directors. We can fix this problem. Next time, instead of making another Coors ad with a faux web-browser look, try putting that creativity to constructive use. Give us Pete Sampras or Norm Macdonald spouting a few zingers. Or, better yet, a fraternity pool party with two guys shotgunning a couple of beers, only to be attacked by the U.S. Women's Naked Soccer team. Only then will our beer commercials once again achieve greatness.","opinion, entertainment, products, tv, trends, advertising, alcohol, commentary, vol 37 issue 17, ed mcintosh, entertainment"
3634,Pro Athlete Lauded For Being Decent Human Being,"MILWAUKEE'Ray Allen, Milwaukee Bucks guard and budding NBA superstar, is drawing raves on and off the court, hailed by admirers as ""not an asshole"" and ""a reasonably decent human being."" The recipient of the NBA's inaugural Magic Johnson Ideal Player Award, Allen was praised by Bucks coach George Karl as ""a true standout individual, the kind of person who treats others with a basic level of respect."" ""Ray Allen is a great player, but he's an even greater person,"" said Karl, who is accustomed to reporters asking him about Allen's normalcy. ""I remember this one time during his rookie season, he was walking back to his car from practice, and a woman nearby slipped on a patch of ice and fell. He could have kept walking, but instead he asked the woman if she was okay. Right then and there, I knew this kid was something special."" Allen, 25, who came to the NBA from the University of Connecticut in 1996, is among the NBA's best at shooting three-pointers, defending the perimeter, and going home quietly after games. A hardworking athlete, Allen has raised eyebrows around the league by never going AWOL or skipping practice. ""I knew when he came into this league that he had the potential to be a standout player,"" said Sports Illustrated basketball writer Marty Burns. ""He had a reputation as a guy who would not only hit the clutch shot down the stretch, but also make eye contact with the towel boy. He has the potential to be a decent human being in this league for another 10 or 15 years if he stays healthy."" ""I'll never forget what he said to me before the first interview I did with him,"" Burns said. ""He said, 'Hello, Mr. Burns.' Then he extended his hand for me to, you know, shake. That's just the type of guy he is."" Allen's remarkable normal-human-being behavior carries over into his personal life. Though unmarried, he spends a respectable amount of time with his 8-year old daughter and is rumored to be on good terms with the girl's mother. He is also said to be close with his own mother. Such decency has not gone unnoticed: Never accused of sexual assault, Allen has earned high praise for his lack of hostility toward women. ""When he was in college, Ray voluntarily went to several UConn women's basketball games and has been quoted as saying that he'd play for a female coach,"" Bucks public-relations director Cheri Hanson said. ""Ray Allen isn't merely in the top 1 percent of NBA players; he's in the 51st percentile of human beings."" In addition to being a media darling, Allen's civility makes him a fan favorite. Though many pro athletes are abusive toward their supporters, Allen has, on numerous occasions, praised a home crowd as ""good"" or ""great."" Last week, after a tough home playoff loss to the Charlotte Hornets, he smiled and signed three or four autographs in the Bradley Center parking lot. ""That's unbelievable,"" said Karl, whom Allen has never threatened physically. ""To come off a tough loss like that in the Eastern Conference semifinals and still be willing to interact with people, you just don't see that sort of thing very often."" ""Acting reasonably nice, exhibiting basic common decency, having a general awareness of other people's feelingsEE that's what sets Ray Allen apart from your run-of-the-mill NBA player,""aid ESPN's Dan Patrick, who called his November 2000 interview with Allen ""possibly the most civil"" of his career. ""Here I am, an interviewer asking him questions, and instead of taking a swing at me or showering me with verbal abuse, he politely responds to my queries. He didn't have to, but he did."" Continued Patrick: ""It's nice to know that in this day and age, there are still athletes out there who say 'thank you' when you give them a new car for making the all-star team.""aa","entertainment, ecstasy of defeat, celebrities, human interest, media, athletes, news, vol 37 issue 19, entertainment"

3636,Nation's Porn Stars Demand To Be Fucked Harder,"WASHINGTON, DC'Seeking to reverse a ""decades-long trend toward shamefully inadequate underfucking in our nation's adult-entertainment industry,"" a coalition of U.S. porn stars gathered in the nation's capital Monday to voice their demand to be fucked harder. ""Uggh! Come on, give me that cock, jungle stud. Fuck me! Fuck me harder!"" said Jenna Jameson, co-chair of Porn Stars For Being Fucked Harder and star of Wicked Pictures' Up And Cummers #10, #11, and #17. ""Deeper! Deeper! Oh, fuck."" The D.C. summit arrives on the heels of years of complaints from disgruntled female sex-industry workers, many of whom had repeatedly argued that, as cock-crazed nymphomaniacs who can never get enough, they weren't receiving the deep-dicking they needed. ""Give it to me! Oh, God, give it to me harder,"" said PSFBFH spokeswoman Christy Canyon, bent over the press-conference podium. ""I fucking need it so bad."" Canyon's sentiments echoed those of many PSFBFH members, who are such nasty sluts that moderately hard fucking is not enough to satisfy their constant craving for hot fuck action. As living embodiments of unrealistic male fantasies, porn stars, experts say, possess extraordinarily high libidos that cannot be satisfied by anything less than full-throttle, no-holes-barred banging. For these women, being such fantasy objects comes at a price: the near-impossibility of attaining the level of full-on pussy pounding they desire, even when lustily worked over by one or more trained professionals. ""The sexual frustration of many porn stars,"" said noted porn expert Bob Guccione Sr., ""is further complicated by the fact that their desires often go beyond traditional vaginally penetrative sex to include a heartfelt need to be repeatedly pounded in the ass, as well."" Tiffany Mynx, PSFBFH co-chair and America's Anal Princess, agreed. ""Oooh, baby,"" read Mynx's testimony before Congress during recent hearings on substandard fucking within the U.S. porn industry. ""I want you to slide that big, hungry dick of yours all the way up my tight asshole right now."" According to congressional sources, meeting the porn stars' demands will not be easy. ""Quite simply, no man alive could give it to these wet, horny bitches in the manner they require,"" said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-MS). ""They represent a fictional, media-created standard of sexual appetite that nobody, male or female, can possibly satiate."" Despite such skepticism on Capitol Hill, the porn stars remain fully committed to their cause. ""Fuck me!"" said porn star Asia Carrera during a recent demonstration in downtown Washington.

3643,No Jennifer Lopez News Today,"NEW YORK'Despite herculean efforts to somehow include her in the day's reportage, journalists, magazine editors, and TV-news producers across the nation have been forced to concede that there is no Jennifer Lopez news today. ""It grieves me to report that 'J. Lo,' America's gluteally gifted superstar diva, did not do anything newsworthy today,"" MTV News correspondent John Norris said. ""As far as we can tell, as of press time, she didn't even leave her apartment."" Members of the media stressed that the dearth of Lopez coverage was not due to a lack of effort on their part. ""The sad reality of this situation is, we've already explored every possible angle,"" People feature writer Jill Smolowe said. ""We did the new-album-coming-out piece. We did the new-movie-coming-out piece. We did the new-album-and-new-movie-are-both-number-one-at-the-same-time piece. We did the breakup-with-controversial-bad-boy-and-millionaire-rap-mogul-Puff Daddy piece, as well as the did-she-or-didn't-she-know-he-had-a-piece piece. And, of course, we've done countless variations on the what-is-she-wearing piece, which, incidentally, is a great piece, because you get to run lots of photos of her wearing whatever it is she's wearing."" One such photo, of the famous ""barely there"" Grammy Awards dress, has been reprinted approximately 5.8 billion times in various media outlets around the globe since its Feb. 24, 2000, debut in more than 450 newspapers nationwide. The photo, which news consumers had hoped to see again today, could not be shown due to a lack of related or even tangentially related Lopez stories for it to accompany. (See photo, right.) Among other Lopez story angles that have already been exhausted by the media: the homegirl-from-the-Bronx-makes-good story, the she-got-her-start-as-one-of-the-""Fly Girls""-on-In Living Color story, and the Lopez-specific variant of the Britney Spears/Christina Aguilera is-she-too-sexy-to-be-an-appropriate-role-model-for-girls story. ""I thought maybe we could do a story about how Jennifer Lopez is a 'triple-threat''i.e., she can sing, dance, and act'but then I remembered that we already shot that wad three issues ago,"" said Us Weekly editor-in-chief Terry McDonell. ""I was thinking, with Puffy's legal situation, we could somehow work her into that context again, but she hasn't really been a part of the trial."" ""Then it hit me: We could do a piece on how Lopez hasn't really been part of the trial,"" McDonell continued. ""I thought I was really on to something there, but then I remembered that The [New York] Observer already did that [in 'Puffy's Trial Begs for Lopez's Presence,' New York Observer, Feb. 19, 2001]."" ""J. Lo, regrettably, is not 'in the house,'"" McDonell concluded with an exasperated sigh. Lopez was last in the news last week, when the singing and acting sensation announced that she had signed a deal to launch her own clothing line under Tommy Hilfiger's label. However, members of the media noted, the story was so widely reported that it would be difficult to find a justifiable reason to report it again today. ""I am excited and proud to enter into this deal with Tommy Hilfiger,"" Lopez told People, Entertainment Weekly, Daily Variety, The Los Angeles Times, The New York Post, Access Hollywood, Extra, The Today Show, Live! With Regis And Kelly, and NBA Inside Stuff. When will the Lopez news drought, now entering Hour 27, end? No one knows for sure. ""Jennifer Lopez, the multi-platinum, multi-talented superstar for the new millennium, the first artist to simultaneously have a number-one movie and album at the same time, the sexy but soulful girl from the wrong side of the tracks with the heartwarming rags-to-riches rise to the top of the entertainment-industry ladder, the fiery red pepper with the legendary Latina butt, who came to national attention as one of the 'Fly Girls' on In Living Color, who may or may not be 'too sexy' to be a good role model for little girls, who was romanced by bad-boy rapper Puff Daddy before their fairy-tale love story was brought to an end by juicy scandal, whose involvement in his subsequent trial was unfortunately negligible, whose recent gig hosting Saturday Night Live was infamously delayed 40 minutes due to an overlong XFL football game, whose smash sophomore release J. Lo, featuring the hit single ""Love Don't Cost A Thing,"" is in stores now, who charmed millions of moviegoers in The Wedding Planner, and who recently signed a deal with Tommy Hilfiger, is not in the news today, and we just have to face that fact and move on,"" said Entertainment Tonight co-host and self-described ""big fan"" Bob Goen.

3648,Vince McMahon's X-SPAN Promises Bone-Crunching Legislative Coverage,"WASHINGTON, DC'At a press conference Monday, pro-wrestling tycoon and entrepreneur Vince McMahon unveiled his latest broadcasting venture: X-SPAN, a 24-hour cable network that promises 'in-your-face, X-treme lawmaking coverage that puts C-SPAN to shame.' 'On March 24, everything you know about the legislative process goes up in flames,' McMahon said. 'Get ready for bone-crunching, smashmouth 21st-century lawmaking.' 'C-SPAN is for wimps,' McMahon added. 'They're a bunch of grannies.' X-SPAN will make its debut at noon in the Bicameraldome, a $460 million, state-of-the-art facility McMahon built to house his new cast of legislators. Opening debate will focus on the Insurance Deregulation Act, an 'X-plosive' new bill that would give large insurance firms greater leeway in investing in foreign holdings. The bill's sponsor, X-Representative Big Kahuna Joe (R-HI), vowed to reporters that he will 'debate any opponent, any time, anywhere, regarding the merits of this bill.' According to the terms of the new McMahon-imposed legislative process, X-Representatives from all 50 states will introduce bills to the Big Bad House Of Pain. Bills passed by a simple majority will be run through The Gauntlet Of Warriors, a hard-core third house of Congress where proposed legislation must survive not only a floor vote but a vicious beating with spiked clubs. If the bill survives, it moves on to the X-Senate and then to the president, who can then either sign it or challenge its sponsor to a chainsaw joust. If defeated in the joust, the bill's sponsor is banished for all eternity to Capitol Hell. In another move designed to stoke viewer interest, legislators will be allowed and even encouraged to date Senate pages, a bevy of short-skirted former strippers dubbed G.L.O.S.S.'the Gorgeous Ladies Of Senatorial Service. 'These gals,' McMahon said, 'are real sluts.' McMahon also promised to make congressional races more 'X-citing' by lifting restrictions on soft money, electioneering, and throwing dust into an opponent's face to blind him. McMahon said he hopes that de-emphasizing 'boring old ethics' will lead to more rivalries and betrayals, spicing up coverage. For the upcoming legislative year, McMahon is grooming as a leading villain X-Rep. Big Chief Tomahawk (D-WY), a bare-chested Sioux chief famous for his 'Warrior Shriek' filibusters. As for breakthrough stars, McMahon is touting The All-American Boy (R-KS), a strapping, blond 'good' X-Senator who takes down opponents of his bills with his signature finishing move, the 'Majority Whip.' Rumors are also swirling around Darkshade (I-Nether Zone), an enigmatic, masked X-Senator who never speaks and always appears with Nevermore, his chief advisor. According to Nevermore, the demons of Cataclysma will break free of their unholy bonds on Halloween during the pay-per-view Senate Slamma-Jamma Damnationals'unless Darkshade's revisions to the Family Medical Leave Act are approved before the stroke of midnight. Despite McMahon's confidence in his new venture, political experts remain skeptical. Commenting on last Saturday's exhibition session, Dr. Anthony Wingfield of Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government said: 'This strikes me as a crass attempt to take a perfectly good political process and make it more exploitative and titillating. If X-Rep. Whack Daddy (D-MI) throws a smoke bomb at X-Rep. J.P. Moneybags (R-CT) because he made romantic overtures to the Beautiful Veronica, that does not make for good government, however satisfying it may be on a primal level.' X-SPAN is also drawing fire from conventional lawmakers, who subscribe to the old-school, 'constitutionally mandated' process of lawmaking. 'The very idea of participatory democracy demands that we, the elected Congress, have full authority to sponsor and vote upon the laws of the land,' said Sen. Don Nickles (R-OK), a 'real' senator from Oklahoma. 'This 'Bunko The Evil Clown' character may consider himself to be acting as senator for the citizens of Oklahoma, but the people know that the men they elected, James Inhofe and myself, are their real representatives in the senate.' Continued Nickles: 'Besides, that thing where Bunko and [Sen.] The Gator [(R-FL)] double-teamed [Sen.] Billy Bob Banjo [(D-AL)] and hypnotized him into voting against his own fair-housing bill? That was totally fake.'","entertainment, tv, trends, media, news media, news, vol 37 issue 08, entertainment"

3651,,"LOS ANGELES'The Fox network's Feb. 15 broadcast of a shark attack on a shipwrecked boatload of Haitian refugees garnered a Nielsen-topping 27.6 rating and 48 share, dominating its 8 p.m. time slot and positioning itself for a 13-week series option, TV-industry insiders reported Monday. The win caps a yearlong trend of human tragedy as the top prime-time ratings grabber for the four major networks. ""We are pleased the shark-attack footage has struck such a chord with viewers,"" Fox Entertainment chairman Sandy Grushow said. ""Of course, we knew people would tune in to watch real-life Haitians struggling desperately among flotsam and wreckage in the open sea, only to be eaten alive by ravenous, blood-crazed schools of sharks in a feeding frenzy, but we never expected these kinds of numbers."" ""I'd just like to thank all the fans for helping us realize our dream of being number one,"" Grushow added. The shark attack is the latest in a string of human tragedies to top the Nielsens. Among previous winners: CBS's November 2000 special on the cannibalization of a stranded Norwegian research team in Antarctica, ABC's PrimeTime Thursday report on villagers being dissolved by molten lava during recent volcano eruptions in Indonesia, and Dateline NBC's five-part special Crushed By An Enraged Bull Elephant. The success of such fare has cemented human tragedy's status as the primary programming directive for the coming season. ""When networks announce their Fall 2001 schedules this May, the watchwords are going to be 'pain and suffering,'"" Los Angeles Times television columnist Howard Rosenberg said. ""CBS has already gotten a jump on the trend by greenlighting Widowed By War, and NBC is reportedly in negotiations for an as-yet-untitled series about earthquakes that orphan small children, leaving them to wander alone through rubble, howling in confusion and despair as they scrounge for food like animals."" Human tragedy, a mainstay of the dramatic arts for thousands of years, has in recent decades been overtaken in the televisual arts by wacky pratfalls and bawdy sexual innuendo. But tragedy is making a big comeback, industry insiders say. Funny and sexy are out; horrific and senseless are in. ""Since the time of Aeschylus, human tragedy has captivated the human mind,"" said media and pop-culture analyst Kurt Andersen, founder of Inside.com. ""Yet the current popularity of televised atrocity'beheadings, disembowelings, and immolation by chemical fires at the sites of industrial accidents'is something new. Never before have we seen such flaunting of the misfortunes of innocents by the major television networks. Because of content restrictions which hampered TV throughout most of its history, raw unedited footage of, say, an Afghan peasant mother and her five screaming children being hacked to pieces by Taliban militiamen was considered 'inappropriate' for viewer consumption."" However, Andersen said, with the advent of the Internet and the effect it has had on traditional television broadcasting, all that has begun to change. ""Now that these constraining standards of propriety have at long last loosened, we are in the middle of a 'Golden Age of Human Tragedy,'"" Andersen said. ""And it has made for some great TV."" Industry observers expect human tragedy to continue drawing big audiences'and big revenues'in the coming years. CBS just wrapped shooting on the series Venereal Archipelago, which will feature 16 young, single islanders slowly succumbing to worsening stages of syphilis. NBC's Tragic Event Sunday will document massacres by Third World despots and train accidents involving chemical spills. And ABC News' much-hyped six-part series on Angolan child amputees disfigured by abandoned land mines is scheduled for November sweeps. Other hot topics coming to the small screen in 2001 include starvation, killer-bee attack, and gang rape.","entertainment, death, animals, tv, television, news, vol 37 issue 06, entertainment"

3655,Irrepressible Bad Boy Slays Seven,"WEST HOLLYWOOD, CA'Watch out, ladies: Irrepressible bad boy Jordan Jeffries, that hard-partying Hollywood hunk who's on everybody's A-list, is at it again. Paroled Jan. 19 after spending six months in Los Angeles County Jail for cocaine and gun possession, the club-hopping cut-up and legendary lothario was once again in hot water Saturday after gunning down seven bystanders at the red-hot L.A. nightspot Skybar, dispatching his victims ""mercilessly and at point-blank range,"" according to police reports. Witnesses said the sexy and oh-so-single Jeffries'best known for his role as daredevil test pilot Johnny Spade in the blockbuster G-Force movies'committed the murders ""for no apparent reason,"" mowing down his terrified prey ""with cold-blooded precision, deaf to their desperate pleas for mercy."" Ouch! Jeffries, 29, who has been romantically linked to everyone from Charlize Theron to James King to Amanda Peet, has slayed plenty of women with his drop-dead-gorgeous looks. But with five males among his seven victims, this notorious ladykiller seems to be a mankiller, too. ""He has all the markings of a sociopathic psychotic, showing no remorse for this brutal mass slaying,"" said LAPD profiler Dr. Leila Briedel-White, who conducted a psychological examination of the homicidal heartthrob following his arrest. ""What he did is beyond the capacity of a normal human being."" ""That certainly sounds like the Jordan Jeffries millions of viewers loved to hate as the duplicitous ladies' man Gregg Grant on To Have And To Hold,"" said Soap Opera Digest editor Ellen Bright. ""But unlike the character he played on THATH, Jordan isn't just breaking hearts'he's firing .38-caliber slugs into them, as well."" The arrest marks the latest in a string of brushes with the law for Jeffries, dubbed ""The Multiple-Convicted Felon Who Cannot Be Tamed"" by Us magazine in its May 2000 cover profile. Past charges range from misdemeanor reckless endangerment and disturbing the peace to such A-list crimes as felonious assault, vehicular manslaughter, and transporting a minor across state lines for immoral purposes. In 1997, the free-spirited Jeffries was nearly extradited to France for his involvement in a Paris hotel fire that left four dead, but his lawyers managed to get him off with a $50,000 fine. This time, LAPD authorities say, if he's convicted of the shootings, the hot-blooded actor and part-time bassist for the band Rocketdog will face stiffer penalties, including seven consecutive life sentences and/or up to 40 hours of community service. Lew Adelman, Jeffries' longtime manager, remains optimistic. ""Jordan is a sensitive, deeply fragile creative talent, and he's had his share of hard times,"" Adelman told Daily Variety. ""Yes, he's a troubled soul, but we're confident that if we can sufficiently prove psychological instability, an insanity verdict can be reached in time for him to complete shooting on G-Force IV: Maximum Thrust. If the trial goes well, his six-week guest spot on ABC's Whizzer & McDeal should also be unaffected."" Lawyers for the talented but troubled actor expressed confidence that they can have the multiple homicide charges reduced to a lesser offense, provided the recidivist romeo'recently spotted at the ultra-hip Hollywood S&M dungeon and sex club Der Vault with his bodyguard and two unnamed models in tow'agrees to drug and alcohol rehabilitation and psychological counseling. Will Jeffries curb his notoriously wild ways? Don't count on it. As he was led away by police after a 45-minute armed standoff, the ever-quotable Casanova told reporters: ""I killed them all! And I'll do it again! Do you hear me? I'll keep on rampaging like an unstoppable murder machine until I breathe my last breath on this accursed Earth!"" Even if found not guilty, Jeffries' has more legal hurdles to clear: He still has two other trials pending, one stemming from a much-publicized fistfight with a transvestite prostitute in a Burbank alleyway in May 1999, and the other for allegedly assaulting a photographer after a night of drug-fueled partying with rapper Ol' Dirty Bastard and teen socialite Nicky Hilton at music mogul David Geffen's Aspen bungalow. He also faces a $23 million civil suit stemming from a March 2000 incident in which he allegedly kidnapped, tortured, and sodomized three Santa Monica teens.","entertainment, celebrities, death, crime, media, news, vol 37 issue 05, entertainment"

3659,Marilyn Manson Now Going Door-To-Door Trying To Shock People,"OVERLAND PARK, KS'Stung by flagging album sales and Eminem's supplanting him as Middle America's worst nightmare, shock rocker Marilyn Manson has embarked on a door-to-door tour of suburbia in a desperate, last-ditch effort to shock and offend average Americans. Accompanied by bandmates Twiggy Ramirez, Madonna Wayne Gacy, and Zim Zum, Manson kicked off his 50-city ""Boo"" tour Jan. 26 in Overland Park, a conservative, middle-class suburb of Kansas City. ""When we first laid eyes on Overland Park, with its neat little frame houses, immaculately landscaped lawns, and SUVs in the driveways, we couldn't wait to swoop down on it like the Black Death,"" said Manson, born Brian Warner in Canton, OH. ""We were like, 'Welcome to our nightmare, you bloated, pustulent pigs.'"" Last Friday at 4 p.m., Mark Wesley, 46, a resident of Overland Park's exclusive Maple Bluff subdivision, heard the sound of ""animal-like shrieking"" coming from the vicinity of his front lawn. Upon opening his front door, he was greeted by the sight of a pale and shirtless Manson carving a pentagram into his chest with a razor blade. ""Look at me, suburban dung,"" Manson told Wesley. ""Does this shock you?"" When Wesley replied no, he said Manson became ""petulant."" Recalled Wesley: ""He started stamping his feet and shaking his fists, saying, 'What do you mean no? Aren't your uptight, puritanical sensibilities offended? Don't you want to censor me so you don't have to confront the ugly truth I represent?' So I say, 'Well, not particularly.' Then, after a long pause, he says, 'Well, screw you, jerk!' and walks off sulking."" That evening, Linda Schmidt was preparing to drive her daughter Alyssa to a Girl Scouts meeting when she found Manson standing on her porch draped in sheep entrails. ""I knew who he was, but I was kind of busy and didn't really have time to chat,"" Schmidt said. ""He just kept standing there staring at me, expecting me to react in some way."" Added Schmidt: ""I tried to be nice and humor him a little. I said, 'Yesiree, that sure is some shocking satanic imagery, no doubt about it. And that one eye with no color in the pupil, very disturbing. I'd sure like to suppress that.' I mean, what do you say to Marilyn Manson?"" A deflated Manson remained on Schmidt's porch as she and Alyssa drove off. Subsequent attempts to provoke outrage were met with equal indifference. ""[Manson] was standing at my front door wearing those fake breasts he wore on the cover of Mechanical Animals,"" retiree Judith Hahn said. ""He said, 'My name is Marilyn Manson, and I'm here to tear your little world apart.' I thought he was collecting for the Kiwanis food drive, so I gave him some cans of pumpkin-pie filling."" Undaunted, Manson and his entourage stepped up their assault on mainstream American sensibilities. On Tuesday, they arrived in the tiny Detroit suburb of Grosse Pointe Farms, where stockbroker Glenn Binford answered his doorbell to find Manson hanging upside-down on a wooden cross as Ramirez performed fellatio on him. ""I just stood there thinking, now there's a boy who tries way too hard,"" Binford said. ""I mean, come on: Homoerotic sacrilege went out in the late '90s."" Other provocative acts by Manson'including dismembering a chicken, bathing in pig's blood, and wearing a three-piece suit of human noses'failed to arouse anyone's ire, instead prompting comments such as ""sophomoric,"" ""trite,"" and ""so Alice Cooper."" Manson's lone brush with controversy occurred in Edina, MN, a suburb of Minneapolis. An unidentified neighborhood-watch volunteer phoned police after seeing a nude, feces-smeared Manson being led around on a leash by a dwarf dominatrix. Officers arrived on the scene, but let Manson go with a warning for parading without a city permit. ""I could have given him a citation, but I figured, how much harm is he really causing?"" Edina Police Officer Dan Herberger said. ""I mean, he's just Marilyn Manson, for the love of Mike."" The ""Boo"" tour was dealt a further blow when Manson learned that Eminem's The Marshall Mathers LP had been banned from all Kmart stores. Manson's current album, Holy Wood (In The Shadow Of The Valley Of Death), is still available. ""Why are all you people outraged by Eminem? He's not scary!"" Manson said. ""He doesn't sport ghoulishly pale skin or wear gender-bending make-up. He's just some regular guy. I'm the one who people should be terrified by, not him! Me!"" ""If you ban me,"" Manson continued, ""I promise to rail against censorship and hypocrisy. Please? Pretty, pretty please?"" By Monday, the tour appeared to have lost all momentum. Sources close to Manson described him as ""exhausted and discouraged,"" despite not having even completed the first leg of the three-month tour. By the time he arrived in Hoffman Estates, IL, Manson had resorted to leaving flaming bags of dog feces on doorsteps and shining a flashlight under his chin to make himself look ""spooky."" He was ultimately chased from a Hoffman Estates subdivision by a group of bicycle-riding teenagers who advised him to ""get [his] chalk-white goblin ass"" out of their neighborhood. On Friday, Manson is slated to appear in Bethesda, MD, where many believe he will bring his tour to a premature end. ""Have you people forgotten already?"" Manson told The Washington Post. ""You all thought I was responsible for Columbine two years ago. Well, I was! I was! I know I vehemently denied it at the time, but, really, I personally told those two kids to shoot up the school. I'm serious. I sent them an e-mail. And I told them to worship Satan, too. You hear that, kids? Marilyn Manson says you should shoot your friends in the head with a gun! And everyone should eat babies! And rape their dead grandparents! And poop on a church! There, now will someone please be offended?""","entertainment, celebrities, music, scandal, news, vol 37 issue 03, entertainment"

3661,Finest Opera Singer Of Her Generation Unknown By Her Generation,"NEW YORK'Alessandra Coletti, the 22-year-old mezzo-soprano sensation, has stunned opera-loving octogenarians around the globe with her astonishing range, power, and upper-register control. Touted as the greatest female opera singer of her generation, the Milan-born, New York-bred Coletti is completely unknown among members of her generation. ""Alessandra who?"" said Amy Sharper, 23, a self-described ""total music freak"" from Reston, VA. ""I think maybe that's the bassist for Nashville Pussy. I'm really not sure, though."" ""A singer of this stature comes along once in a lifetime,"" said Thomas Sagal, 71, editor of Opera Digest, which boasts a circulation of nearly 38,000 elderly readers. ""Her recent performance as the princess in Dorgomizhsky's The Mermaid at the Leningrad Opera was electrifying. It must be thrilling for young people to know that one of their peers is such a prodigious talent."" During a recent performance of Mascagni's Cavalleria Rusticana at the Lyric Opera in Chicago, Coletti played to a capacity crowd of 4,600 old people. Of the 23 teenagers in attendance, 22 were ushers and one was dragged to the performance as punishment. ""My mom said if she ever caught me drinking again, she'd force me to go to an opera with her,"" said Courtney Weis, 15, who was not enthralled by Coletti's stirring vibrato and formidable coloratura agility. ""Holy shit. Let's just say I'm never touching Jack Daniel's again."" Raised by symphony violinists Celeste and Antonio Coletti, young Alessandra grew up surrounded by opera and classical music. ""My earliest memories are listening to Enrico Caruso 78s on my parents' Victrola,"" Coletti said. ""When I was seven, they took me to see Renata Babek in La Gioconda. What a thrill that was. I remember asking my mother why there were no other children in the audience. She told me they were all across town at Carnegie Hall watching Tchaikovsky's Queen Of Spades."" In 1997, after two years of study at the Rimsky-Korsakov conservatory in St. Petersburg, Coletti returned to the U.S. At the tender age of 18, she made her Metropolitan Opera debut as Inez in L'Africaine. Dazzling even the most jaded audience member with a bravura performance, Coletti received a five-minute standing ovation from people more than four times her age. In attempting to describe Coletti's astonishing gifts, fans often invoke the legends of opera, from Emma Eames to Denyce Graves'names that would draw blank stares from anyone under 50. ""Of the great female opera singers of today, few are comparable to Coletti,"" said near-death Chicago Tribune opera critic Arthur Sachs. ""If she continues to progress at her current rate, I might one day even put her in the class of a Maria Callas."" Widely considered the finest operatic voice of the 20th century, Callas is unknown among 18- to 24-year-olds, ranking behind rubber-faced '70s funnyman Charlie Callas in celebrity-Callas name recognition. One of Coletti's few fans not born in the first half of the last century is Andrew Shermer, president of the Twentysomething Opera Appreciation Society (TOAS). ""I formed TOAS after seeing Alessandra Coletti's Violetta in La Traviata,"" said Shermer, 24. ""I'd seen opera before and enjoyed it, but seeing her at the Met that night blew my mind. It inspired me to start up a web site, toas.com, to reach other people my age with interest in the opera."" Thus far, TOAS has attracted only five members. And while www.toas.com receives an average of 10,000 hits a week, an analysis of its traffic indicates that 99.999 percent of those are from people who misspelled ""Taos,"" a popular New Mexico ski destination.","entertainment, music, culture, news, vol 37 issue 03, entertainment"

3668,Critics Hail Porn Director's Debut As 'Shamelessly Masturbatory Male-Empowerment Fantasy',"LOS ANGELES'Across the nation, critics are unanimous in their praise of Brenda In The Ass 2: Butt Reams May Come, hailing the debut of porn director Ricky D'Alessandro as ""the most exploitative, shamelessly masturbatory male-empowerment fantasy ever committed to video."" ""I've never seen such utterly depraved filmmaking,"" raved Kenneth Turan, film critic for the Los Angeles Times. ""D'Alessandro portrays women as little more than sexual receptacles. What little dialogue and plot he provides are flimsy excuses to undress starlets Brandi Reardon, Rebekka Rivers, and Jizzelle."" Turan's colleagues were quick to heap further laurels on the film. ""Brenda 2 is a pandering, lowest-common-denominator wank-fest,"" CNN reviewer Paul Clinton said. ""Perverted beyond belief."" ""D'Alessandro plumbs the depths of sexual abomination, then goes one nauseating fathom deeper,"" said Peter Howell of The Toronto Star. ""I never imagined a film could be this sick."" ""Brenda 2 is disgusting and demoralizing,"" said Entertainment Weekly's Lisa Schwarzbaum, who said she ""would not be a bit surprised"" if D'Alessandro were nominated for Best New Director at this year's Adult Video News Awards. ""This is nothing but gratuitous, non-stop flesh with zero redeeming artistic value."" According to Entertainment Productions, D'Alessandro's Burbank-based production company, the film took less than a week to shoot in D'Alessandro's living room, jacuzzi-equipped bathroom, and van. ""No dark impulse is left unexplored,"" New Yorker critic Anthony Lane breathlessly gushed. ""If sickening close-ups of Rebekka Rivers' super-stretched anus is your idea of entertainment, by all means rush to your video store. Not even the repetitious, saxophone-laden soundtrack, sloppy editing, and total lack of filmcraft can detract from the aura of sleazy, shamefully adolescent puerility in which D'Alessandro soaks the entire 'film.'"" D'Alessandro, already at work on his next feature, said he is ""stunned"" by the positive response to Brenda 2. ""Who would've thought a regular guy like me could make 'the most obscene, corrupt pornographic filth ever committed to high-definition video'?"" said D'Alessandro, speaking from the Van Nuys Motor Lodge, where he is scouting locations for his next film. ""Look out, San Fernando Valley'I'm the porn king of the world!""","entertainment, movies, sex, gender, news, vol 36 issue 46, entertainment"
3669,Joe Eszterhas Brought In To Punch Up Senate Bill,"WASHINGTON, DC'Concerned that the bill is too dry to connect with mainstream taxpayers, the U.S. Senate has brought in high-profile Hollywood screenwriter Joe Eszterhas to punch up Internal Revenue Code Amendment Act S. 1792. ""We're extremely pleased to have Joe working on this project with us,"" said Sen. Paul Wellstone (D-MN), addressing reporters at a press conference Monday. ""As the man behind Basic Instinct and Flashdance, as well as countless other sexy box-office sizzlers, we felt he was the ideal guy to give this bill the jolt of electricity it needs."" S. 1792, which would amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend expiring provisions and fully allow nonrefundable personal credits against regular tax liability, has already been through six rewrites, worked over by such Washington heavy hitters as Sen. Fred Thompson (R-TN) and Sen. Joseph Biden (D-DE). But after the sixth rewrite tested poorly in subcommittee, the Senate decided to bring in an outsider. ""We originally envisioned S. 1792 as a small, independent bill,"" said Wellstone, taking off his yellow-tinted, horn-rimmed glasses. ""But after a couple of drafts, we realized that this thing had the potential to be something much bigger. We felt like somewhere in those 120 pages was a major hit just waiting to get out'if only we could find that perfect person to sculpt it and make it shine. That's when my co-writer Barbara Boxer turned to me and said just one word: 'Eszterhas.'"" The bill was immediately sent to Eszterhas, who ""really responded to the material."" ""I read the bill and thought, this is an amazing piece of work. But it lacks a third act and a compelling villain,"" said Eszterhas from his Malibu beach house. ""Still, I showed it to [director] Paul Verhoeven, and he flipped out. He said I'd be a schmuck if I didn't do it."" After a brief period of negotiations with the screenwriter's agent over points and backend, Wellstone and Boxer got Eszterhas on board. ""We were clear that we wanted Joe to 'dial up' the bill, make it bigger, funnier'really make it pop'but still preserve the soul and integrity of the original,"" Boxer said. The first rewrite was satisfactory for both sides, with Eszterhas adding sections that would provide tax breaks for Asian hookers, Colombian drug smugglers, and voyeurs with ties to the S&M underworld. With his next rewrite, Eszterhas continued to ""add more heat to the bill,"" shifting its focus from tax credits for working parents earning less than $20,000 annually to increased penalties for stalkers of cat-fighting exotic dancers. It was also during this rewrite that the bill's name was changed to S. 1792: Maximum Liability. ""The buzz on this bill is incredible,"" said James Swendeman, editor of CQ Weekly. ""This is going to be the sleeper hit of the 107th Congress, and it hasn't even been formally submitted yet. Representatives will be lining up around the block to vote for it. There hasn't been anything like this since Reagan's Star Wars defense proposal."" The hype generated by S. 1792: Maximum Liability has many senators scrambling to inject some of its ""over-the-top"" feel into their own bill-writing. ""A lot of folks on Capitol Hill are going around saying, 'We need our own S. 1792, something sexy with major crossover appeal,"" said Sen. Tom Harkin (D-IA). ""For years, I've wanted to write a bill that would raise the minimum shower time for female prison inmates to 30 minutes, but I felt it would have been too exploitative. Now, I see that's just what Congress wants."" Some Beltway insiders remain cautious about the bill, noting that many previous attempts by Hollywood writers to punch up federal legislation have met with failure. ""When John Sayles worked on the bill for increased health benefits for Alaskan fishermen, it was a beautiful, poignant bill,"" said Sen. Ernest Hollings (D-SC). ""It only got 11 votes in the House, but those congressmen who supported it were deeply moved. Not at all like that $220 billion asteroid-defense-system bill Jerry Bruckheimer put out a few years ago. It was a soulless piece of crap, but everyone showed up for that vote."" Despite the buzz S. 1792 is generating, some cracks have begun to show in the working relationship between Eszterhas and the Wellstone/Boxer team. In a Monday conference call, the two senators clashed sharply with Eszterhas over the screenwriter's proposed changes to the story arc involving families with two or more dependents. ""We hope to keep the bill out of turnaround, but if pressured, we will put a pin in the project,"" Boxer said. ""According to the contract, we can keep asking for rewrites, but Eszterhas has the power of final draft. Still, if we don't like what we see, we can always take our names off S. 1792 and replace them with the pseudonym Rep. Alan Smithee (I-CA)."" If the bill dies in the Senate, Eszterhas said he plans to shop it around Washington to find a new legislator to submit the bill. ""I see this bill as Showgirls meets HR 2859,"" Eszterhas said. ""I'm getting Sharon Stone, Michael Douglas, and Linda Fiorentino to help lobby for it. If Boxer and Wellstone don't have the vision to see that this bill is going to be bigger than 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell,' I'll go over their heads."" Eszterhas has also demanded an executive-producer credit on any sequel bills.","entertainment, politics, celebrities, movies, congress, news, vol 36 issue 45, entertainment"

3673,NBC News Reverses Earlier Report Of Gore's Death,"NEW YORK'Three hours after placing Al Gore in the ""dead"" column, NBC News retracted its projection Tuesday, changing the vice-president's status to ""too close to call."" ""I'm sorry, but it now appears that we reported Mr. Gore's death prematurely,"" NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw announced on air at approximately 2:15 a.m. EST. ""The latest readings show his red-blood count down to 3.1. At this point, it could go either way."" Gore, shot Monday by a Republican sniper during a foray into the Bush-controlled territory of New Hampshire, has been clinging to life in a hospital just across the Vermont border. According to NBC News correspondent Tim Russert, nurses and anesthesiologists leaving the operating room at various points during a 14-hour operation on Gore were exit-polled regarding his chances of survival. ""When several sources reported a direct hit to the spinal cord, everyone thought it was all over,"" Russert said. ""It turns out that report was erroneous. The shot missed the spinal cord by a hair's width."" Early in the evening, NBC's on-screen outline of Gore was colored blue, signifying life. At 11:17 p.m. EST, it turned red, indicating death. When word arrived that Gore had a pulse but no signs of brain activity, the outline reverted to its original uncolored state, meaning ""unconfirmed."" In the hours following the erroneous report, NBC was more cautious about making projections, posting the latest readings from Gore's blood-pressure monitor but refraining from speculating about his overall status. Democratic Party chairman Ed Rendell expressed anger over what he called NBC's ""shoddy, irresponsible journalism."" ""Who knows how this could affect how Gore is perceived when he attempts to gather military support in disputed states?"" Rendell said. ""NBC should know better than to call the outcome of an operation before the body is even closed."" NBC was not alone in prematurely calling Gore's death. CBS, ABC, and CNN all made the same mistake. ""In our efforts to bring Americans the most up-to-the-minute news on the war for the White House, we made some hasty decisions,"" CBS anchor Dan Rather said. ""I'd like to apologize to all of our viewers, as well as to the entire Gore junta.""","entertainment, media, elections, news, vol 36 issue 41, entertainment"

3676,I Must Take Issue With Entertainment Weekly's C-Plus Grade For The DVD Release Of The Patriot,"I usually enjoy Entertainment Weekly a great deal, devouring everything from Jim Mullen's Hot Sheet to the Gimme Shelter profiles of on-the-market celebrity homes to the always cheeky CyberDigest column. And, as a rule, I trust the magazine's reviews, confident that if Ken Tucker says the new CBS show The Fugitive is an A-minus, it's an A-minus. I must, however, take strong issue with the C-plus grade for the DVD release of The Patriot. While I concede that The Patriot had its flaws, it hardly deserves the pitiful C-plus rating the usually reliable Ty Burr mystifyingly chose to bestow upon it. In dismissing The Patriot as a ""revolutionary ruckus,"" Burr willfully ignores all that was worthwhile about this Revolutionary War epic, including the kinetic, vibrantly directed battle scenes that put moviegoers mere inches from the Redcoats. And Aussie heartthrob Heath Ledger's (10 Things I Hate About You) star-making performance as Mel Gibson's (Braveheart) eager-to-fight teenage son. And the numerous extra goodies on the DVD, including director Roland Emmerich's (Independence Day) surprisingly illuminating commentary track. I'm not saying the movie deserved an A. Or even a B-plus, for that matter. The Patriot is rife with historical inaccuracies, and the German-born Emmerich's grasp of the colonial political climate of 1776 is tenuous at best. But don't you think at least a B would have been in order? Is this really the sort of movie that would cause one to muse that ""the narrative breakthroughs of Saving Private RyanEE have been swallowed by the mainstream and digested into pap""Apparently so, provided your name is Ty Burr. I don't know what was going on over there at the EW offices this week, but something was definitely off. I mean, rating Fatboy Slim's new single ""Ya Mama"" a C? Giving a B to the WB fansite www.charmed.org? Doling out a C-minus for Keri Russell's delightful new hairdo? None of these, however, got my goat quite like the C-plus for The Patriot. Then there's the not-so-small matter of the title of the review. ""Soldier Ploy""? Upon what, pray tell, is that supposed to be a pun? When The Patriot first hit theaters, EW cleverly titled its review ""Revolutionary Bore."" You may have disagreed with that assessment (I certainly did), but there's no denying that it's a clear, direct play on ""Revolutionary War."" But ""Soldier Ploy""? What's that? My only guess is that it's a play on ""Soldier Boy."" Should that be the case, such punnery would have to be regarded as a stretch, to be kind. The only aspect of The Patriot review that was dead-on was the caption accompanying the photo of Gibson as lead character Benjamin Martin. The movie is, indeed, ""all about the Benjamin."" Gibson is in top form throughout, virtually exploding off the screen with brooding, musket-wielding bravado. But one good photo caption is not much to recommend about an entire review. To prove that injustice was, indeed, served by Mr. Burr, we need only look at the ""What We Said Then"" addendum which follows ""Soldier Ploy."" The addendum, a paragraph-long distillation of Owen Gleiberman's June 30 review of The Patriot, concludes with his original grade for the film: B-minus. The grade is a far more accurate appraisal of the movie's worth. For some reason, though, four months later, the magazine's editors made a cowardly retreat from Glieberman's more Patriot-friendly stance, docking the film a notch. They say hindsight is 20/20, but in Entertainment Weekly's case, it seems to be more like 20/80. I'd give Ty Burr's review a C-minus. No, make that a D-plus.tt","opinion, entertainment, commentary, vol 36 issue 39, ronald nisley, entertainment"

3686,CNN Still Releasing News Piled Up During Elián González Saga,"ATLANTA'CNN officials announced Tuesday that the cable network is 'making good progress' in its ongoing effort to release the vast backlog of news accumulated during Elián González's headline-dominating seven-month odyssey in the U.S. 'Ever since little Elián went back to Cuba on June 28, we've been working overtime to get through all the news we bumped during that gripping, emotional saga,' CNN vice-president Susan Bunda said. 'There are all sorts of stockpiled stories to report, and we feel the American public will find much of it interesting, informative, and even a bit surprising, considering all of it happened three months ago or more.' Among the backlogged stories to air during recent CNN 'News You Didn't Hear' coverage: the formation of the new Eastern European nation of Molbania last December, the French government's Feb. 9 decision to sell the Mona Lisa in private auction and the painting's subsequent purchase by Ted Turner, the discovery of mysterious carnivorous plant spores in southern Missouri in early April, and the June 4 congressional vote to grant federal legislators a 400 percent pay hike. Last Thursday, the network reported the annexation of South Carolina by North Carolina, which acquired its bankrupt neighbor in March in accordance with the terms of an obscure, centuries-old clause in the South Carolina tax code. 'This news is significant, in that it reduces the number of U.S. states to 49,' Bunda said, 'and we feel it is something the American people deserve to hear about. But it lacks the compelling, personality-driven storyline and heartrending video footage of the Elián crisis, so we had no choice but to temporarily shelve it at the time it occurred. We did get a few complaints from South Carolina viewers who were disappointed in the lack of coverage, but what can we say? Unfortunately, these things happen in television. That's just the name of the game.' Added Bunda, 'Boy, that Elián sure was an adorable little fella, wasn't he? I wonder what he's up to nowadays, that little rascal.' Other months-old developments which may come as a surprise to CNN viewers include January's Russian rickets epidemic, which left half the nation with the disease; the surprise April 22 eruption of a volcano in a remote section of South Dakota; and the sudden disappearance of the star Alpha Centauri, the sun's closest stellar neighbor, which collapsed into a black hole in late May. 'The South Dakota volcano thing, maybe we could have run that if there'd been some sort of huge disaster associated with it,' CNN Headline News president Bob Furnad said. 'But, unfortunately, there were no casualties. Also, there were no big jets of flame either, because it was one of those boring, magma-flow type of eruptions. So the best visuals we could come up with were some dull computer graphics of the new fault line, detailing the splitting tectonic plates.' 'Likewise,' Furnad continued, 'if Alpha Centauri had gone supernova, well, then we would've had something. But, somehow, it just collapsed into a black hole, with no big, exciting explosion footage to give the story some 'oomph.' Scientists can't even explain why: They say it defies all known laws of physics. So that makes it hard to find a good hook, you see.' Reclusive novelist Thomas Pynchon, who came out of hiding on May 17 to speak out on some sort of impending crisis, breaking more than 20 years of media silence, expressed hope that his segment will eventually reach the airwaves. 'Hello? It's me, Thomas Pynchon,' Pynchon said. 'I have J.D. Salinger here with me, too. We're here trying to raise awareness of this profoundly serious crisis. Is anybody listening?' Those interested, Lang said, can learn what Pynchon had to say during CNN coverage of the May 17 announcement, slated to air sometime around Christmas. 'With any luck, that is,' Furnad said. 'After all, you never know when another doe-eyed waif will wash up on shore and set everything else back another couple months.'","entertainment, cnn, tv, trends, media, news media, news, vol 36 issue 36, entertainment"

3689,I Just Love The New Channel 29 News At Noon Set,"As a regular viewer of Channel 29 News At Noon, I must say that I am very impressed by the revamped set. When I tuned in Monday for my daily dose of Ron Reynolds and Katie Hsu, I couldn't believe the great changes! Some very sharp people must have put their noggins together to come up with the new look. The most obvious change is that they've gotten rid of the old desk and replaced it with a much more modern-looking one. It's sleek and has these fancy strips of turquoise-ish glass running all the way along the bottom. It's the kind of state-of-the-art desk that truly makes me feel like Channel 29 is the place for ""On-Point News You Can Use."" They've also replaced the old chairs with ones that pivot. Ron and Katie really seem to be having a much easier time chatting at the end of segments, now that they don't have to turn their heads to the side all the time. Yesterday, after an ""Around The Town"" segment about Maggie's Munchables, a new bakery that just opened over on the west side, Katie turned to Ron and said, ""Mmm'sounds good."" To which Ron replied, ""I think I'm going to have to go off my diet for a few days."" It was just perfect! Then there's the new Channel 29 logo on the back wall. I really like it. The old one was just painted flat onto the wall, but this one sticks out and looks three-dimensional. It's curvy and slants a little bit to the right, almost as if it's leaning forward to reach out and grab the news! Plus, there's just a hint of metallic-gold trim around the numbers, which helps offset the fun turquoise color and give it a certain air of seriousness. I must admit, when I first saw the set, I thought to myself, ""Where's the monitor? How are they going to show the footage of the Wednesday's Child's outing with his Big Brother?"" I soon found out that they have a special monitor that rises out of a pedestal! When not in use, it's tucked away unobtrusively. Another smart move was the construction of a special Pet Of The Week alcove. Now, when Donna from the Humane Society drops by on Thursdays, there's a special little area just for her. And the sports desk is now part of the main desk area, which I'm sure makes sports anchor Craig Cohen feel much more like part of the team. That also means meteorologist Nick Fields now has a much shorter walk from his AccuDoppler weather map to the sports desk for a little post-forecast banter with Craig. Somebody had his thinking cap on when these changes were made, that's for sure! With the new set has also come a whole new way of doing things at Channel 29. The boring old news-sports-weather format has been broken up, so now they can squeeze in lots of great new features, like Dr. Asa Gregory's ""Heart Beats"" segment. My other favorites are ""Web Watch,"" ""Koats 4 Kids,"" and ""Channel 29 Salutes."" On Tuesday, they saluted a local restaurant owner who donates day-old bread to a nearby senior center. It's so nice to learn about the people and places that shape my community! I've also noticed that, with the new set, the News At Noon team has been dressing in a much more casual manner. While he still wears suits for the 6 p.m. news, Ron has ditched his sportcoat for News At Noon. And Katie has been experimenting with scarves in a way she never would have on the old set. Why, things are so casual, Ron even jokes around with the camera crew and other people offstage! Sometimes, he'll make fun of Rudy the cameraman's loud Hawaiian-print shirts. Some people may consider that sort of thing unprofessional, but I don't think so at all. I think it's fun! It makes me feel like that barrier between anchor and viewer is broken down, and we're all having a good time together. Someone clearly put a tremendous amount of time and effort into deciding what the new set would look like. It's obvious that everything was very carefully considered, from the color of the carpet to the size of the new clip-on microphones. Well, their time was not wasted, because people like me really notice these things. Channel 29, you really are ""The True News Leaders.""","opinion, entertainment, tv, trends, senior citizens, commentary, vol 36 issue 34, betty woodley, entertainment"

3694,Do I Look Fat In This Motion Picture?,"Oh, my God. I cannot believe these dailies. They say the camera adds 10 pounds, but in my case, it has got to be more like 20. I just knew I shouldn't have let Freddie talk me into getting the spinach salad with balsamic vinaigrette at Spago. Especially not with shooting the next day. I mean, I only ate half of it, but still! What sucks is, I was really hoping the critics would be impressed with this one. That Lisa Schwarzbaum bitch is totally gonna mention my thighs in her review, I just know it. Now, be honest, okay? Totally honest. Do you think I look fat in this motion picture? God, I am such a cow. Even though you've only been my personal assistant for a few weeks now, I totally love you like a sister, and feel like I can completely trust your judgment. I seriously cannot blow this, you know? This is a very critical time for my career, what with Jennifer Love and Reese looking really thin these days, so I definitely cannot afford not to look my best right now. I work out every day. You know that, right? And I've been making amazing strides with my personal dietitian over the last three months, so it's not like I don't make the effort to look good. I'm worried that maybe there's something about this particular director of photography that doesn't bring out my best. Like yesterday, when we shot that scene where I was gazing out the window and being all introspective and stuff, I thought I had the emotional range down. But, I don't know, did you think maybe I looked a little puffy in my cheeks? Because I sort of thought that maybe the lighting was, you know, making the backs of my arms look flabby. Oh, you're just saying that! You're just trying to make me feel better. Oh, my God, I hate backlighting. It makes me look as big as that Alicia Silverstone hog. Every time I'm backlit for anything closer than a medium-depth cutaway, it's like, oink city. And I don't even want to talk about the way it brings out the dark circles under my eyes. Let's just not even go there, okay? Maybe it's the script. Do you think this premise makes me look bloated'single girl finds love and a career in fashion design when she befriends a pair of magic talking pumps? It's not my fault, right? I just don't think supernatural romantic-comedy scenarios are slimming on me. And the pool scene! Let's not even discuss it. Because if we do, I'm totally going to start bawling right now, and we'll have to bring Diandra back in here to redo my entire face, and I just can't handle her at the moment. I looked hideous in that bathing suit, I just know it! How could I have let that costume designer talk me into that horrid chrome and magenta one-piece anyway? It was so not Sarah Michelle. I looked like some fat old 30-year-old in that thing. At this rate, I just know Freddie's going to dump me and take Kirsten Dunst to the Oscars! Fuck Kirsten and her stupid hit cheerleader movie. I could have had that part if I wanted it. Oh, God, I'm hyperventilating. I have to go on camera soon, and I simply cannot work in this state. Oh, God, I need some Vitamin B. Give me that plate of arugula. Give it! No, I don't want any foie gras with it, you moron, just the arugula! Like I need any more fatty acids today? Hel-lo? I'm sorry I snapped at you, Rochelle. You know how upset I get when I'm retaining water. I just need to channel that energy into my craft. It's all part of the creative process. Maybe it's not so bad. I mean, these publicity photos aren't that awful: I'm looking provocatively at the camera, hips cocked and fingers splayed out over my hips. But, still, doesn't my bellybutton look a little spongy? Maybe it's the outfit. I should've gone with the other tanktop. I knew it. I so totally knew it. Okay, new topic! Because I do not even want to talk about it. Do my ankles look swollen in these press-release photos? Be honest. Kind of thick? Or is it just me?","opinion, entertainment, celebrities, movies, advertising, commentary, vol 36 issue 32, sarah michelle gellar, entertainment"

3696,Troubled Robert Downey Jr. Placed Under 24-Hour Media Surveillance,"HOLLYWOOD, CA'Robert Downey Jr., the emotionally unstable ""bad boy"" actor who was freed from prison Aug. 2 after serving one year on cocaine and gun-possession charges, has been placed under 24-hour media surveillance, sources reported Monday. ""This is a critical juncture for this prodigiously gifted but deeply troubled young man. A lifelong drug abuser, Mr. Downey is at great risk of suffering a relapse and, as such, needs around-the-clock supervision,"" Entertainment Tonight executive producer Andrea Appel said. ""That's why it's vital that we keep our cameras trained on him at all times."" Downey, whom doctors have described as ""a human powderkeg"" in the wake of several nervous breakdowns and his recent jail term, may snap at any time. As a result, he is in need of constant trailing by hordes of reporters, photographers, and TV cameramen. ""Robert Downey Jr. is extremely vulnerable and needs us right now,"" Access Hollywood associate producer Russell Courtnall said. ""If he goes on a 72-hour coke binge, or if he goes a week without sleeping because he's mainlining monkey tranquilizers, or if he's spotted drunkenly soliciting transvestite hookers on Sunset Boulevard after wrecking his car, it will be a terrible tragedy, yes. But if it does happen, he can at least take comfort in the knowledge that his suffering and embarrassment will be shared by millions of total strangers."" The media have rallied in support of Downey, pledging airtime, magazine and newspaper coverage, and even Internet links in their effort to keep him under constant watch. Entertainment Tonight dug deep into its file-footage archives to air several profiles on Downey. USA Today has run six stories about the volatile actor in the past three weeks. And, in perhaps the most impressive gesture of support yet, Fox has offered Downey a recurring role on Ally McBeal, stepping in with budgetary allocations and casting resources to make sure he can be monitored by at least 15 million Americans a week. ""If we could, we'd put him on the air every night,"" Ally McBeal creator David E. Kelley said. ""Unfortunately, we are only one weekly television show."" Longtime Downey collaborator James Toback, director of such Downey vehicles as The Pick-Up Artist, Two Girls And A Guy, and Black And White, cautioned that Downey's fragile psyche ""could crumble at any moment."" ""Robert is one of the sweetest, kindest, gentlest souls I have ever encountered. He can also go through an entire kilo of top-shelf China White faster than you can say 'Jack Robinson,'"" said Toback, himself no stranger to the ravages of bacchanalian excess and drug abuse. ""I fear that it's only a matter of time before he ends up, at 4 a.m. some Wednesday night, crawling out of a seedy Van Nuys strip club with his pants half off, attempting to convince random passersby to give him a ride to Seattle while teams of LAPD cops try unsuccessfully to restrain his PCP-saturated body."" ""When that terrible tragedy does occur,"" Toback continued, ""I only pray that my cameras'or somebody, anybody'will be there to capture it all on film."" Only time will tell whether Downey's recovery is permanent or merely a brief pause before his next plunge into an orgy of headline-grabbing decadence and self-destruction. But one thing is certain: From the National Enquirer reporters who have selflessly penned shocking cover stories to keep public awareness of his plight alive to the late-night TV hosts who have devoted significant portions their monologues to his ongoing battle with his demons, Downey is not alone. ""The outpouring of attention by the media in response to one celebrity's hardships helps us all breathe a little easier,"" Appel said. ""And helps us feel more confident that, should Downey ever return to his dark days of drugs, guns, and hedonistic mayhem, we'll all be right there with him, glued gap-mouthed and wide-eyed to our TVs to bear witness to his pain.""","entertainment, celebrities, tv, drugs, mental health, media, news, vol 36 issue 30, entertainment"

""By depicting it so frequently and so casually, this film only serves to condone the act of lovemaking.""

3699,Science Guy Bill Nye Killed In Massive Vinegar/Baking-Soda Explosion,"SEATTLE'In a shocking, educational tragedy, PBS television host and science guy William ""Bill"" Nye was killed Monday in a massive vinegar/baking-soda explosion that destroyed an entire city block and showed kids how they can inflate their very own weather balloon using everyday household items. ""Today, we mourn the loss of a truly great guy of science,"" said Nye Labs spokesman Phil Anspaugh, standing near the still-foaming blast site. ""Bill Nye was a man who, more than anything else, wanted to enlighten, entertain, and demonstrate how vinegar and baking soda combine to create carbon-dioxide gas."" According to colleagues, Nye, the popular host of Bill Nye The Science Guy, had previously performed the fatal experiment on a much smaller scale without incident. On Monday, however, he filled a 5,000-gallon In-Ground Steel Container Of Science to the top with white vinegar and pulled a Giant Red Lever Of Science, releasing a dump-truck load of baking soda into the vat. ""The resulting exothermic reaction was supposed to inflate the Giant Weather Balloon Of Science that Nye had suspended above the vat,"" Anspaugh said. ""But something went horribly wrong and the resulting explosion destroyed the tank, the truck, the balloon, and Nye himself. We're still searching for his body and bow tie."" ""Did you know that if you put all of your body's blood vessels in a line, they would stretch around the Earth two and a half times?"" Anspaugh added. ""Well, now you know."" Local police are working closely with Nye Labs to determine what may have caused the routine experiment to go awry. ""Bill Nye was a very careful man,"" Nye Labs technician Julie Eng said. ""All of his experiments were suitable for children to perform, as long as they made sure to have an adult assist them with the hard parts and to wear eye protection. For him to die this way, it's unthinkable."" However, other Nye Labs employees noted that Nye's unquenchable thirst for knowledge had led him into dangerous territory before, citing the series of static-electricity experiments which resulted in Nye being burned over 75 percent of his body while electrostatically suspended from the roof of the Kingdome. ""There was nothing he wouldn't do in his quest for scientific knowledge,""Nye Labs bio-engineer Randy Grein said. ""He gave of himself so that we might know more about the world around us. Without Bill, we never would have known that a sneeze sends germs flying out of your nose at 100 mph, owls can turn their heads 270 degrees, and Mercury and Venus are the only planets without moons."" Grein admitted to familiarity with the dark side of Nye's obsessive vision. ""I still have nightmares about the Very Large And Extreme Gyroscope Of Science,"" Grein said. ""That monstrous apparatus almost taught the children of Seattle about angular momentum the hard way."" Grein also noted Nye's aborted attempt to build the world's largest soda-bottle water tornado, which burst during its final stages of construction, soaking hundreds. ""Bill's only fault was that he pushed the envelope a little too far sometimes,"" Grein said. ""Especially with the baking-soda-and-vinegar experiment. I always knew that would be the one to get him in the end.""","entertainment, celebrities, science, tv, news, vol 36 issue 29, entertainment"

3704,Harry Potter Books Spark Rise In Satanism Among Children,"LOCK HAVEN, PA'Ashley Daniels is as close as you can get to your typical 9-year-old American girl. A third-grader at Lock Haven Elementary School, she loves rollerblading, her pet hamsters Benny and Oreo, Britney Spears, and, of course, Harry Potter. Having breezed through the most recent Potter opus in just four days, Ashley is among the millions of children who have made Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire the fastest-selling book in publishing history. And, like many of her school friends, Ashley was captivated enough by the strange occult doings at the Hogwarts School Of Witchcraft And Wizardry to pursue the Left-Hand Path, determined to become as adept at the black arts as Harry and his pals. ""I used to believe in what they taught us at Sunday School,"" said Ashley, conjuring up an ancient spell to summon Cerebus, the three-headed hound of hell. ""But the Harry Potter books showed me that magic is real, something I can learn and use right now, and that the Bible is nothing but boring lies."" Ashley is hardly the only child rejecting God these days. Weeks after the release of Goblet, the fourth book in J.K. Rowling's blockbuster kid-lit series, interest in witchcraft continues to skyrocket among children. Across America, Satanic temples are filling to the rafters with youngsters clamoring for instruction in summoning and conjuring. Over protests from Christian Right leaders, who oppose the books for containing magic'and, by extension, Satanic religious beliefs'millions of children are willing their bodies and souls to Lucifer in unholy blood covenants. In 1995, it was estimated that some 100,000 Americans, mostly adults, were involved in devil-worship groups. Today, more than 14 million children alone belong to the Church of Satan, thanks largely to the unassuming boy wizard from 4 Privet Drive. ""The Harry Potter books are cool, 'cause they teach you all about magic and how you can use it to control people and get revenge on your enemies,"" said Hartland, WI, 10-year-old Craig Nowell, a recent convert to the New Satanic Order Of The Black Circle. ""I want to learn the Cruciatus Curse, to make my muggle science teacher suffer for giving me a D."" ""Hermione is my favorite, because she's smart and has a kitty,"" said 6-year-old Jessica Lehman of Easley, SC. ""Jesus died because He was weak and stupid."" But as wild as children are about Harry, no one is happier about the phenomenon than old-school Satanists, who were struggling to recruit new members prior to the publication of the first Potter book in 1997. ""Harry is an absolute godsend to our cause,"" said High Priest Egan of the First Church Of Satan in Salem, MA. ""An organization like ours thrives on new blood'no pun intended'and we've had more applicants than we can handle lately. And, of course, practically all of them are virgins, which is gravy."" With membership in Satanic temples reaching critical mass in some areas, many children have been forced to start their own organizations to worship the Lord Of Lies. Houston 11-year-old Bradley Winters, who purchased Goblet Of Fire with his own allowance money at the stroke of midnight on July 8, organized his own club, Potterites To Destroy Jesus, with his neighborhood pals. An admission fee of $6.66 grants membership to any applicant willing to curse the name of God and have a lightning bolt carved into his or her forehead with an iron dagger. ""The Harry Potter books are awesome!"" Winters said. ""When I grow up, I'm going to learn Necromancy and summon greater demons to Earth."" It's more than just the kiddie set and Satanists, however, who are rejoicing over Harry's success. Educators nationwide are praising the books for getting children excited about reading. ""It's almost impossible to find a book that can compete with those PlayStation games, but Harry Potter has done it,"" said Gulfport (MS) Middle School principal Frank Grieg. ""I have this one student in the fifth grade who'd never read a book before in his life. Now he's read Sorcerer's Stone, Prisoner Of Azkaban, Chamber Of Secrets, Goblet Of Fire, The Seven Scrolls Of The Black Rose, The Necronomicon, The Satanic Bible, The Origin Of Species'you name it."" Less pleased are Christian leaders, who see Pottermania as a serious threat to their way of life. ""Children are very impressionable,"" said Dr. Andrea Collins of Focus On Faith, a Denver-based Christian think-tank and advocacy group. ""These books do not merely depict one or two uses of magic spells or crystal balls. We're talking about hundreds of occult invocations. The natural, intuitive leap from reading a Harry Potter book to turning against God and worshipping Satan is very easy for a child to make, as the numbers have shown."" ""These books are truly magical,"" Collins added, ""and therefore dangerous."" But such protests are falling on largely deaf ears, especially in the case of Harry's creator. ""I think it's absolute rubbish to protest children's books on the grounds that they are luring children to Satan,"" Rowling told a London Times reporter in a July 17 interview. ""People should be praising them for that! These books guide children to an understanding that the weak, idiotic Son Of God is a living hoax who will be humiliated when the rain of fire comes, and will suck the greasy cock of the Dark Lord while we, his faithful servants, laugh and cavort in victory.""","entertainment, kids, harry potter, news, vol 36 issue 25, entertainment"

3709,"Even Though I'd Never Seen Major League, I Found Major League II Surprisingly Easy To Follow","Whew, what a relief. I hate when I can't follow a film, and I was afraid it'd happen again Friday night. But, to my delight, I was able to fully understand and enjoy Major League II, despite the fact that I'd never seen the original. After a long, hard week of work at Apex Driving School, I decided to kick back on the couch and treat myself to a night of television-watching. After ordering a pizza, I started flipping through my TV Guide, hoping to find something good. But as hard as I looked, nothing really seemed up my alley: There were the Daytime Emmy Awards on ABC, some boring old musical on TNT, and four straight Saturday Night Live reruns on Comedy Central. There was, admittedly, Major League II on Cinemax. But despite my love of baseball, I fretted that I'd likely be lost in the plot, not having seen the 1989 original. Sure, I could've bravely forayed into the 1994 Sheen-Berenger vehicle, but what if every other line of dialogue referred obliquely to something from the original film, making it impossible for me to follow the plot? I certainly didn't want to relive my Mannequin 2 debacle of 1991. On the other hand, I needed something to watch, and I needed to make a fast decision before my pizza got cold. Besides, maybe I'd get lucky, and Major League II would open with a montage of clips from the original, a device many of the better sequels employ to help viewers ""get in the spirit"" of the original film. After a few moments of deliberation, I resolved'not without some trepidation, mind you'to commit to the 8:10 p.m. showing of Major League II on Cinemax. I needn't have worried! The film opened with a concise rundown of the major characters from Episode I, cunningly presented as ""Indians talk"" on a Bob Uecker-hosted sports-radio show! Uecker was not playing himself, though: He was Harry Doyle, a character who, from what I could gather, figured heavily in the first installment, as well. At any rate, the opening recap, helpful as it was, was almost unnecessary: The movie's characters were so real, so richly textured, I instantly felt like I knew them. It was clear what was going on right from the get-go. In the previous season, the Cleveland Indians had rallied from being a rag-tag bunch of losers to winning the pennant. Episode II picks up at the start of the following season, with old pals reunited and ready for more good times. But an ominous question looms over their heads: Has success changed them? I am sad to say that the answer was a resounding yes. No one illustrated this complacent, fat-cat mentality better than Charlie Sheen's Rick ""Wild Thing"" Vaughn, who arrives for the first day of spring training in a limousine. Now, since I'd never seen this character before, you're probably thinking, ""But, Don, how do you know it's a change? He might have ridden in a limousine throughout the first movie!"" In this scene, the screenwriters clearly took pains to anticipate any potential confusion on the part of those who didn't see the first film. Wild Thing's fans are all waiting for him to show up to spring training, and when a guy rolls up on a bad-ass motorcycle, they justifiably assume it's him. But, as it turns out, it's someone else, and the fans are all surprised. This surprised reaction is not merely funny; it gives the uninitiated a solid idea of what they're supposed to expect from Wild Thing. So when Wild Thing steps out of the limo in a suit and yuppie haircut, and the fans are disappointed and confused, we instantly recognize that a profound change has occurred in this character's life, whether or not we saw the first movie! Needless to say, I am now hooked on the Major League franchise. In fact, when I was at Suncoast Motion Picture Company the next day, I made a point of picking up a copy of the prequel. Even better, they had a marked-down copy of the third installment, 1998's Major League'Episode III: Back To The Minors. I watched it that night and loved it, even though Wild Thing and a lot of the other central characters from the first two movies weren't even in it. My best advice to the uninitiated would be to see the Major League movies in order. But if you can't, don't worry: Each movie truly does stand on its own.","opinion, entertainment, commentary, vol 36 issue 19, don grella, entertainment"

3715,Why Haven't There Been Any Good Father-Son Mind-Transfer Comedies Lately?,"I know what you're thinking: not another lecture about how Hollywood has lost its way, and the studios don't know how to make a winning picture anymore. Well, indulge me. I just have to spout off about this. Entertainment Weekly's summer-preview issue arrived in the mail yesterday, and guess what? Once again, not one major studio has on its slate a father-son mind-transfer comedy! It seems like every movie put out today is some kind of serious drama, romantic comedy, or historical epic. And, yes, there's a certain amount of science fiction, but it always takes the form of a big action-adventure with spaceships and ray guns. I ask you, how is that supposed to teach a father and son that it's not so easy being the other, after all? I can still remember seeing Like Father, Like Son in the theater for the first time. It was the spring of '87. Knowing next to nothing about the film, I went only because I'd enjoyed Kirk Cameron's work on Growing Pains. What I saw on that screen changed my life. It was stunning, heartbreaking, hilarious, and profound, all in one beautifully constructed 98-minute package. And, as I don't need to point out to film buffs, it ushered in what still stands as the Golden Age of father-son mind-transfer comedies. The next year, 1988, witnessed the release of the genre-defining Vice Versa, starring Judge Reinhold and Fred Savage. You'd better believe I was first in line! In fact, I was 37 days ahead of the second person! And while Like Father, Like Son will always have a special place in my heart, I must admit that Vice Versa is, on the whole, a superior film. By (quite literally) putting themselves in each other's shoes, Savage and Reinhold deliver two of the gutsiest performances ever committed to celluloid. Capping that magical year, the kind of year one can revisit only through the warm, sepia-toned hue of nostalgia, was 18 Again! starring George Burns and Charlie Schlatter. That was when film was magic. Though this was, in the most technical sense, a grandfather-grandson mind-transfer comedy, thematically and qualitatively, I put it right up there alongside the likes of Versa. Schlatter's bravura turn as the 81-year-old in an 18-year-old's body should have catapulted him to Hollywood's A-list, but, as we know all too well, greatness does not always translate into stardom. My friends were all into the Star Wars movies when we were kids, but my interest was limited to the scene where Luke cuts off Vader's head, and the helmet cracks open and Luke sees his own face inside. I really thought they were onto something there, but they never really did anything with it. Just imagine what might have been had Luke and Vader somehow swapped places! While wandering around the Death Star, Luke could have tripped and fallen into some sort of experimental mind-transfer device that Vader was in the midst of checking out. Now, that would've been a movie! So what gives, Hollywood? Don't you know how to weave pure cinematic gold anymore? Surely you're not so obsessed with counting your riches that you've forgotten how to enchant an audience with a simple yet profound tale of a father and son magically placed in each other's bodies? I know what you're thinking: ""Hey, mac, what about mother-daughter mind-transfer comedies? What about the 1977 Jodie Foster-Barbara Harris classic Freaky Friday?"" Sure, Freaky Friday was a great film, its influence on the subsequent wave of father-son mind-transfer comedies undeniable, but somehow it still doesn't quite measure up. Neither do any of the trans-gender mind-transfer comedies, including that episode of Gilligan's Island where the mad scientist swaps the Professor's brain with Ginger's, and all that. And don't go talking to me about Big, either. There wasn't a dad or mom in that! The way this vital genre has been ignored, not only by the big studios, but by so-called ""indie"" filmmakers, you'd think the father-son mind-transfer concept has been fully tapped, its every creative possibility exhausted. But when you're dealing with a genre this fertile, there's always plenty of new ground to explore! What if, for example, the dad were a drill sergeant and the kid a slacker goof-off? The dad's platoon could end up winning the big boot-camp showdown because ""Sarge"" taught them how to cheat. Meanwhile, the kid's band becomes a hit because the ""son"" made them practice, practice, practice! I realize there are some plot holes, like how would the dad know how to play guitar, but maybe he magically picked up the son's musical ability during the transfer, because it wasn't a perfectly clean switch. The transfer could be a military experiment, explaining the dad's participation, and the kid could walk in on it accidentally while making some mischief around the base! That would tie up all the loose ends while remaining true to the characters! Or suppose the dad's a hotshot lawyer, and the son's a goof-off party animal whose law-school admissions exam is just days away? They swap bodies, and the son figures he's got it made, since his dad will be the one taking the test. But then they get switched back just hours before the exam! But guess what? The kid passes the test due to the real-life experience he'd just gotten while inside his dad's body in court! And the dad learns a valuable lesson, too, discovering just how tough it is to be a kid these days. I'm not specifically pitching these premises, I'm just trying to give you a general idea of the possibilities. I forget which Joseph Campbell book it was that explained the timeless narrative device of a father and son disliking their lives while envying that of the other until an ancient totem transfers their spirits into each other's bodies. But it showed just how resonant this story is: Regardless of what culture tells the story or when, the father and son always get switched back in the end. Clearly, this is a thematic construct that speaks forcefully to something deep within the human condition. So get cracking, Hollywood! What's holding you up? Are you worried that all the good titles have already been taken? How about Switcheroo? Or Being Dad. Or maybe even Body-Swappin'! I, for one, would like to see Tim Allen and Frankie Muniz in the starring roles.","opinion, entertainment, commentary, vol 36 issue 15, walter lolich, entertainment"

3717,Maybe This Appearance On Jenny Jones Is Just What My Marriage Needs,"My husband Cal and I have been going through some pretty tough times in our marriage lately. For the past three months, Cal's been cheating on me with Rhonda, this 18-year-old stripper who used to babysit for us. And just yesterday, after beating me with a tire iron, he told me Rhonda's pregnant and wants us to raise the child. As you can probably guess, I'm furious at Cal. But I'm not perfect, either: I did, after all, have sex with his father. All sorts of confused thoughts run through my head, and I just don't know what to do. My mother thinks I should dump ""that piece-of-shit asshole fuck,"" as she's fond of calling Cal. My best friend Adrienne thinks we should get counseling. I'm thinking an appearance on The Jenny Jones Show is just the thing to save our marriage. I watch Jenny every day, and I really think she could give us the advice and guidance we sorely need. Her show tackles relationship problems like mine all the time, and Jenny's incredible at dealing with them. First of all, she's full of the plain, common-sense wisdom that all the great daytime talk-show hosts, from Sally Jessy Raphäel to Mother Love, share. I remember one episode where this middle-aged woman was cheating on her husband with her teenage stepson. She said the boy wasn't technically related to her, so what was the problem? I must admit, the woman's argument seemed pretty sound to me. But Jenny really put things in perspective. First, she asked this lady, ""What if your husband was cheating on you? Wouldn't you be hurt?"" Then Jenny added, ""You're this boy's stepmom! Stepmoms aren't supposed to do things like that!"" I remember sitting at home in awe. I never thought of it quite that way! As great as Jenny is, the studio audience deserves a lot of credit for counseling people, too. They provide just the kind of support system people need when discussing their embarrassing problems on national TV. I particularly remember one audience member's input. The show, titled ""I Can't Control My Sexy Teen!"", featured a panel of overweight teenage girls who dress like sluts. About halfway through, a male audience member stood up and said to these girls, ""Can all y'all ladies say 'choo-choo,' 'cause alls I sees a ho train! Ho!EE Ho!EE Ho!""k about helpful! These remarks let the girls see that their mode of dress was causing them to be treated with less respect than they deserved. I only pray that such insightful and compassionate people are in the audience if and when Cal and I appear. Maybe if I come on the show wearing my favorite green dress, someone will refer to me as ""yo, the lady in green."" (The audience always calls the guests it most cares about by the color they're wearing.) And maybe someone will point out that I gots to check myself before I wreck myself. Because I do. Sometimes, it takes a stranger in a TV audience to hammer home a point like that. If Cal and I do get on Jenny Jones, I'm really hoping Jenny springs a surprise guest on us. Like maybe some other woman he's been sleeping with that I don't even know about. That would be great! Then the three of us could sit down and work out our differences by screaming at each other in front of millions of people. That's just the kind of open, loud communication you need in a successful marriage. I was heartened by the interest I got from The Jenny Jones Show when I contacted them recently. Linda, the assistant producer, said my story would fit very well into the upcoming show, ""My Man Won't Stop Cheating & Beating!"" Linda then asked me if I'd discussed appearing on Jenny Jones with Cal. I said no, because he was busy working time-and-a-half at the grain elevator. ""That's great,"" she replied. ""Just tell Cal that the two of you are going on Jenny Jones because you won the 'Jenny Jones World's Greatest Hubby Video Essay Contest.' He'll be sure to agree to go on. Then, when Cal comes onstage, everybody will boo him, and we'll reveal the real reason he's on the show'because he's a cheating, beating, lowdown, rotten skunk."" For a moment, I was confused. ""Won't that just make him angry at me?"" I asked. But then Linda reminded me of all the hurt Cal had caused me, and said that if anyone deserved a taste of his own medicine, it was him. Well, I couldn't disagree with that logic. Besides, if the audience taunted and mocked Cal the way they did the ""Over-80 Transvestites"" who were on last week, maybe Cal would see the error of his ways and stop fooling around! So, hopefully, you'll be seeing Cal and me on Jenny Jones real soon. There's a chance we may get turned down, which would be terribly disappointing. But if that happens, there are other ways to get the marriage counseling we need. Like by going on Jerry Springer. Like Jenny, Jerry always seems to lend a caring, sympathetic ear, and his ""Final Thought"" is always filled with the sort of solid, time-tested advice that never fails to rub off on guests.ooff","opinion, entertainment, commentary, vol 36 issue 13, anne-marie krebs, entertainment"

3723,I Wish I Were One Of TV's Golden Girls,"Ever since my fall, I've been watching a lot more TV. It's lucky, too, because I've discovered the most delightful new show. It's called The Golden Girls. It's on every day at 5:30 p.m. on channel 14 and is about four women, Dorothy, Blanche, Rose, and Sophia, who are getting on in years, just like me. And, like me, they have no husbands, and their children rarely visit or call. In the past, I never looked at the ""boob tube"" much. Other than watching the Weather Channel to check for storm advisories for Cincinnati, where my daughter Emily lives, I barely even turned the thing on. But with Harold gone two years this month and me not really trusting myself to take the bus to church anymore'not to mention the broken hip'let's just say I've had a lot of time on my hands. I can't even crochet or sew anymore because of the arthritis, so rather than just sitting in my blue chair staring at the wall for hours, I've started to look at the TV. Lately, the highlight of each day is when I tune in to see what's going on in the lives of these Golden Girls. It's such a nice escape to be able to step into this wonderful world where older women wear stylish clothing, say lots of clever things, and, judging from the way they are always on the go, have no problems with bursitis, high blood pressure, or hemorrhoids. The Golden Girls have a lovely Florida home with a full patio and breakfast nook, and they go on vacations and take dance classes together. Sometimes, I try to imagine what it would be like if their house had one more bedroom, and I lived there. Though I don't think it would be appropriate to date at my age, I would very much enjoy the companionship of some good friends. I would readily agree to do all the housework if it meant I had someone to talk to once in a while. And if I fractured my hip, I would have the assurance that I wouldn't have to lay on the floor in pain for three days, waiting each day for the mailman's footsteps so I could cry out in the hopes of getting his attention. Of course, living in a house full of women is bound to cause some tension, especially when everyone has such different personalities. Sophia is grumpy and always has some smart-alecky thing to say. (At first, I didn't like her much, but I soon saw that even she has a soft side. Besides, you have to be tough growing up in Brooklyn.) Dorothy, Sophia's daughter, inherited her mother's mouth and is the unofficial leader of the gang. Blanche, a wild Southern belle, is quite the narcissist. Rose, on the other hand, is sweet and dim-witted. She reminds me of my dear sister Lydia, who passed on last year. Sometimes, one of Rose's silly remarks about small-town life brings me to tears, making me think about how much I miss my one and only sibling, who is gone forever. The Golden Girls often get mad at each other. At times, they even resort to calling each other nasty names, using words I don't think one should be able to say on television. But at the end of the day, they always find a way to patch things up and become the best of friends again. I sure wish I had some friends living close by. Ruth, my best friend of 51 years, is in a home down in Emmetsville. I haven't seen her since Christmas of 1997, and at that point, she didn't recognize me or her own children anymore. My, it looks so sunny and beautiful down there in Florida. It's terribly cold up here. I'm so frightened of catching pneumonia like Harold did, I hardly leave the house during the winter anymore. I signed up for Meals On Wheels last month, and most days, they drop by with something to eat, so I don't have to turn the stove on anymore. (I accidentally left the gas on last December but, luckily, the neighbors smelled it and pounded on my door.) I do get jealous of the Golden Girls, how they have each other. But I need to remember that it's not all cake and ice cream for them. They've had to face some very difficult situations recently, like when Dorothy found a lump in her breast, and the time Blanche found out that her late husband had fathered an illegitimate child, and when Rose was cut off from her husband's pension. But by sticking together, they're able to face even the worst. As for me, I am left to face the world alone.","opinion, entertainment, television, senior citizens, commentary, vol 36 issue 08, irene drew, entertainment"
3724,Comedian Confesses To Killing Them Out There,"ROYAL OAK, MI'Stand-up comedian Tony Campanelli confessed Monday to the Feb. 26 killing of 180 comedy-club patrons during a performance at Crack-Ups in Royal Oak. ""Man, I killed 'em,"" the 33-year-old Campanelli told Royal Oak police interrogators. ""You shoulda seen them rolling out there. I really knocked 'em dead."" Among Campanelli's victims were seven employees of Johnson Control Auto Parts, a bachelorette party consisting of 12 Dearborn women, and 20 members of a University of Michigan fraternity. All were absolutely slain. Police arriving on the scene minutes after the killing found the club's showroom a mess of split sides, busted guts, and three or four blown minds. Campanelli was arrested an hour later at a nearby Denny's restaurant, where he was discussing the show with emcee Mike Berman, who may have acted as an accomplice by ""setting up"" the crowd for Campanelli's performance. Forensic investigators say Campanelli repeatedly hit the audience with his best stuff throughout his 25-minute killer set, unleashing a deadly arsenal which included ""extremely sharp observations about the differences between men and women"" and several barbed quips questioning the deal with bad toupees. ""From the bit about The Clapper to the whole 'What if Captain Kirk were ordering from Jack Nicholson at McDonald's?' thing, they never had a chance,"" comedy-forensics expert Jim Edmonds said. ""He really brought out all the big guns."" Weapons found at the scene included a battery-powered bullhorn and a large photograph of President Clinton with the mouth cut out. It is believed to be the worst comedy killing since 1996, when 67 patrons of The Giggle Hut in Kansas City were slain by noted prop-comic ""Party"" Marty Schiafo. Another 141 people were killed when the incident spread to local streets, escalating into a full-scale laugh riot. Though details of the incident are still emerging, a taped 911 call reveals a panicked audience member desperately shouting, ""Oh, my God, I can't breathe!"" Survivor Stephanie Bogen, a 22-year-old Southfield paralegal, described the comedy carnage. ""It was horrible,"" Bogen said. ""[Campanelli] was mercilessly spraying the place with one-liners. All around me, people were falling out of their chairs. When he did the bit about Michael Jackson as Dirty Harry, I thought I was done for."" According to Royal Oak police chief Tom Pryor, the killing may well have been a ""copycat"" crime. ""Not only is his methodology and psychological profile extremely similar to that of fellow stand-up Bobby Greenfield,"" Pryor said, ""his Mike Tyson-on-Gilligan's Island bit is pretty much exactly the same."" ""There's still a lot more to be learned about Campanelli, but we do know that his basic profile is that of a drifter, traveling from city to city, having one-night stands with a string of audiences,"" Pryor continued. ""We also know that he has a history of mental problems, having spent a weekend in May 1996 at The Funny Farm in Stockton, CA."" Speaking to reporters from his Macomb County Jailhouse cell, Campanelli expressed no remorse for his deadly act. ""Yeah, I killed them,"" Campanelli said. ""And I'll do it again.

3730,They Finally Got The TV Schedule Exactly Right,"It sure took those network programmers long enough. But better late than never, I suppose. For years, I was convinced they'd never get the TV schedule right. I mean, talk about a mess! Did those geniuses at NBC think I had nothing better to do with my Thursday 8:30 to 9 p.m. slot than watch some weak ER lead-in like Jesse, just because I already had the network on at 8 for the must-see Frasier? And don't even talk to me about CBS. For months, they had Now And Again on Tuesdays at 8 p.m. Everyone knows that show was made for Fridays at 9! What in the world were they thinking? As long as you're at it, you CBS Einsteins, why don't you take Ladies Man out of its Monday 8:30 slot and move it to Wednesdays at 8:30, opposite ABC's Norm? Yeah, that'd be a great idea! Things looked truly bleak. But just as I was about to give up once and for all, I opened up my brand-new TV Guide a few days ago and saw that everything had finally fallen into place. The Hughleys on at 9:30 Fridays, Third Watch on at 10 p.m. Mondaysf It was all too perfect! I can barely remember the last time the TV schedule was so right. It must have been around 1985. NBC's legendary Thursday-night lineup'Cosby at 8, Family Ties at 8:30, Cheers at 9, Night Court at 9:30'was the anchor of a sublime, perfectly arranged week. On NBC on Mondays, you had TV's Bloopers and Practical Jokes from 8 to 9, then you could switch over to CBS for Kate & Allie, followed by Newhart at 9:30. It was poetic in its simplicity and elegance, a sleek, two-hour jungle cat of prime-time entertainment. For a brief, shining moment, it was Camelot. But, of course, they had to go and mess it all up. When the 1986 season came around, they'd moved Kate & Allie to 8, forcing me to choose between that and NBC's concurrent offering, the delicious ALF. Then, to add insult to injury, they followed Kate & Allie not with Newhart as in the previous year, but with the subpar Pam Dawber vehicle My Sister Sam. It was awful. And that's how it was until just this past week. I can't believe that last year at this time, they were making me choose between King Of The Hill and 3rd Rock From The Sun. Why even go through the trouble of making these great shows if you're just gonna run them opposite each other? I mean, I can only watch one at a time, for God's sake! And don't even talk to me about VCRs'it's just not the same. But, fortunately, all that's in the past. Because after years of waiting, they've discovered the ideal mix. I don't work in TV programming, so I have no idea why it took so long, but there must be a lot of complicated rules that kept them from just putting everything on at the right time. But now that it's perfect, the networks will never have to change the TV schedule again.

3733,Thanks For Dedicating That Mediocre Sitcom Episode To My Memory,"Well, it's been two weeks now since my fatal heart attack, and all I can say is, thanks, guys. Thanks so much for honoring my 56 years of life on this planet by dedicating that episode of Veronica's Closet to me. Some people, when they die, get a tree planted in their memory. Others get a plaque, or maybe even a statue. But if you ask me, there's no better way to show that a man's life had meaning than by dedicating a stupid, unfunny episode of some lousy sitcom to him. Yes, for all eternity, when people think of Veronica's Closet episode 55, ""Veronica's New Cat,"" they'll think of Bill Unseld. What better way is there to sum up and give dignity to a human being's life? When the credits rolled and the screen went black, reading, ""For Bill Unseld, 1943'2000,"" a tear surely trickled down my grieving wife's cheek. Linda knew me better than anyone else in the world, so she no doubt recognized that this wacky, mix-up-packed episode of Veronica's Closet was truly what I was all about. Sure, like most people, I had hopes that when I died, I'd be recognized for my achievements, whether it be my contributions to the television industry, my work with various local charities, or the many years of love and devotion I gave my beautiful wife and three children. But, wow, ""Veronica's New Cat""? You sure you want to set that one aside for me? I mean, after all, this is the episode in which Veronica's birthday gift to Olive doesn't go over big, so Veronica lies and tells Olive that she bought her a second, thoughtful gift, as well. Panicked, she sends Josh out to get something for Olive at the last minute, but he comes back with cat supplies. When Olive sees them, Veronica lies again and tells Olive she bought herself a cat and that the cat stuff is for her. So, then, Ronnie has to go out and get a second gift and a cat. Could there possibly be a more apt, fitting tribute to all that I was and stood for? I think not. What an incredible honor. I mean, It's not like I was Johnny Carson. I made a few contributions to the television industry here and there. I was a key grip for two seasons of Chico And The Man, and in the mid-'80s, I did some sound work for Scarecrow & Mrs. King. I also helped NBC's technical department develop a high-durability caster that rolls smoother. But, gee, guys, there's no need to pull out all the stops and dedicate that whole episode to me! When I started in television at age 15, fetching sandwiches for The Jack Paar Show, I hoped I could grow up to make a difference in this business and maybe, in my own small way, leave an enduring legacy. Little did I dream that episode 55 of Veronica's Closet would be that legacy. I mean, I hardly think my meager four decades of service warrants such a high honor. Better you should dedicate it to our nation's Vietnam veterans. Or the selfless men and women of the Red Cross. I suppose cultural historians of the future will think I must have been a great, great man to have ""Veronica's New Cat"" dedicated to me. The entire episode, mind you. Not just the scene in which Veronica tries to hide the cat from Olive under her desk, but it starts meowing, so Veronica has to pretend she's the one who's making the noise. No, the entire episode. My great-grandchildren can take profound pride that one of their ancestors merited that level of tribute. For me, there is no regret in having departed this mortal coil, for the world shall forever know that for a time, there lived a man named Bill Unseld, a man who gaffed for a television program called Veronica's Closet, and that the collective creative energy that went into the making of the 55th episode of that program was done in posthumous tribute to that man. I rest peacefully in my tomb, for I know that so long as the great medium of television exists, a small part of it will have existed as a means of paying respect to my life and legacy. There can be no greater honor. Fuckers.","opinion, entertainment, death, television, commentary, vol 36 issue 03, bill unseld, entertainment"

""I described a virtually identical scenario last May on alt.tv.star-trek.voyager, saying it would make a great episode,"" said Cordwainer following the airing of ""Star-Crossed,"" in which the described events occur. ""Why do they even pay writers if they're just going to steal their ideas off the Internet? They should be paying me."" Responding to charges from fellow Internet users that his idea was for a Janeway-Tom Paris romance, Cordwainer said, ""That just shows how they changed my idea around so I can't sue them.""","entertainment, people, television, news in brief, vol 35 issue 43, entertainment"
3740,Thank You For The Article About Cher,"I've never written in to a magazine before, but I just had to tell you how thrilled I was when I picked up your Nov. 20 issue and saw who was on the cover. Thank you so much for the wonderful story about Cher! I'm a huge fan, and it's great to see her finally getting the attention she so richly deserves. Whoever's responsible for putting Cher on the cover deserves a big raise! Cher isn't just a sexy, sensationally talented diva. (Although she's definitely that!) She's also a survivor. Through more than 30 years in the entertainment business, she's seen it all'the highs and lows, the ups and downs. And through it all, she's held her head high and always come out on top. We can all learn a lesson from her. As great as your Cher story was, though, the photos were even better! (With a bodacious body like that, how could they not be?) For a longtime Cher fan like me, those pics were a real trip down memory lane. I especially loved the one of her and then-beau Tom Cruise at the 1985 Academy Awards. And the one of her with then-beau Val Kilmer at the premiere of Silkwood wasn't too shabby, either! (Talk about outrageous'whoever designed that dress Cher was wearing forgot to finish it!) I'm sure some sourpusses will write in and complain about all the cosmetic surgery Cher has had. The fact is, Cher looks great and is a role model for women everywhere. (If you ask me, she's 53 and fabulous!) It's so sad that a lot of people feel threatened by a strong '90s woman who wants to look her best. Besides, Cher is always upfront about it, unlike a number of other stars I could name. And Cher is still going strong to this day. In fact, she's better than ever. In true Cher style, just when it looked like she was out of the limelight for good, she stormed the pop charts again this year with her biggest song yet, the smash dance hit ""Believe."" Rather than viewing it as Cher's comeback, I think it proves that she never left! And thanks, too, for mentioning Cher's greatest role of all: mother. (You thought I was going to say Loretta Castorini in Moonstruck?) Through all her trials and tribulations, she has always been there for Chastity and Elijah Blue. And she has bravely stood by Chastity, regardless of her sexuality. You've got to admire a woman who never loses sight of the fact that family is the most precious gift of all. I'm also pleased that you did not neglect to mention Cher's passionate work with various wonderful charities. Not only has she worked extensively with the Children's Craniofacial Association (after her triumphant role in Mask brought her close to the subject), but she is an active fundraiser for AIDS research and donates her time to a number of gay-rights groups. Talk about a juggling act! We should all think about Cher the next time we say we don't have time to give to others. So thank you, thank you, thank you for writing about Cher! Bette Midler, Barbra Streisand, Celine Dion and Diana Ross, you are all incredible, but for my money, the ultimate diva will always be Cher. Keep up the good work, folks! Oh, and by the way, what has that hunky George Clooney been up to lately? I haven't heard a thing about him in two weeks!","opinion, entertainment, celebrities, commentary, vol 35 issue 43, lynette loesser, entertainment"

3742,"Molly Hatchet's Nightmare Descent Into Booze, Sex, Drugs 'Not All That Nightmarish,' Guitarist Admits","JACKSONVILLE, FL'The nation's celebrity-biography industry is reeling following Monday's admission by former Molly Hatchet rhythm guitarist Billy Joe Reeves that the rock band's so-called ""nightmare descent into booze, sex and drugs"" at the height of its late-'70s popularity was ""actually not all that nightmarish at all."" ""In the summer of 1979, Molly Hatchet was on top of the world. We'd just completed a sold-out tour opening for the likes of Bob Seger and Cheap Trick, and our sophomore effort, Flirtin' With Disaster, was a hit with audiences and critics alike,"" Reeves told Peter Briley, host of the daytime cable-access talk show Jacksonville Community Voices. ""Almost overnight, we were big stars, and things started getting out of control: drugs, alcohol and constant anonymous sex with teenage groupies."" When asked if the experience had been a living hell, a nightmare descent into booze, sex and drugs that almost cost him his life, Reeves stunned Briley with his answer. ""I really wouldn't call it 'nightmarish,' per se, no,"" Reeves said. ""In fact, it was really fucking great. Lord almighty."" Reeves' admission has set off shockwaves within music-bio circles, sharply defying many long-held assumptions about the high price of fame. ""This revelation has stirred up no end of controversy in virtually every corner of the country's $4.2 billion pseudodocumentary industry,"" said VH1 Behind The Music producer Doug Farelli. ""If what this man is saying is true, the very foundation of everything we have come to believe about the celebrity rise-fall-redemption arc may be suspect."" Said E! True Hollywood Story producer Ellen Donovan: ""One has to ask: If the excesses of fame are not, in fact, the living hell we have come to believe they are, what else is untrue? What about the heartwarming happy ending, when, after losing all their money, they go clean, settle down and start over again with a better life? Are we to believe that's all just some terrible lie, too?"" During his headline-grabbing interview with Briley, Reeves insisted that sudden fame and fortune did not result in deep inner turmoil and suffering on the part of Molly Hatchet's members, slowly tearing them apart until the band collapsed under the weight of its members' tortured self-destruction. Rather, Reeves said, the struggle, heartache and pain didn't kick in until well after the band had peaked. ""To be honest, if anything, it was the nightmare descent into a lack of booze, sex and drugs that really hurt,"" said Reeves, who has worked at his brother-in-law's bait shop since leaving Molly Hatchet in 1986. ""The excesses of fame were just fine, thank you very much. It was the non-excesses of non-fame that were the hard part."" Jimmy Gaines, a back-up percussionist with Lynyrd Skynyrd from 1977 to 1981, agreed. ""The booze, the sex, the drugsEE Those are three great things, and I miss them all terribly,""aines told MTV News' Kurt Loder during a special investigative report on the controversy Tuesday. ""As a matter of fact, I'm looking forward to starting up a second, brand-new nightmare descent into all that stuff just as soon as I can manage it."" Despite the stir his remarks have created, Reeves is not backing down. ""Come on, I'd be high as a kite, a joint in one hand and a fifth of Jack Daniels in the other, and all I had to do was play the first four bars of 'Whiskey Man' and the panties would start dropping,"" said Reeves, eyeing with wistful longing the Frank Frazetta painting of a battle-axe-wielding barbarian on the cover of 1980's Beatin' The Odds. ""And you're asking if it filled me with a gnawing emptiness and despair I couldn't escape? Hell, no. Those days with Danny Joe, Duane, Bruce, Dave and Banner were pretty much the best thing that ever happened to this here good ol' boy, and that's a fact.""ll","entertainment, music, drugs, scandal, news, vol 35 issue 42, entertainment"

3744,Jewish Anti-Deprecation League Protests New Woody Allen Movie,"NEW YORK'The Jewish Anti-Deprecation League picketed the New York premiere of Woody Allen's latest film, Waltzing With Schopenhauer, Monday, arguing that it ""perpetuates misleading stereotypes of Jewish self-deprecation that do not reflect the modern Jewish-American experience."" The JADL is decrying Allen's portrayal of the film's lead character, Reuben Hirschhorn, a Columbia University creative-writing professor who, despite achieving considerable personal and career success, is plagued by severe self-doubt, hypochondria, perceived sexual inadequacies, an inability to commit to long-term relationships, existential angst, an obsessive fear of death, and disturbing dreams involving his overbearing mother making chicken soup for Nazi propaganda minister Josef Goebbels. ""Mr. Allen has made a career out of presenting his own foibles and insecurities as characteristic of all Jews,"" JADL executive director Howard Klosterman said. ""Jews are tired of seeing themselves routinely represented as neurotics who can't enjoy their lives, no matter how successful, and Mr. Allen is one of the primary perpetrators of this offensive cliche."" Continued Klosterman: ""Contrary to what Mr. Allen would have you believe, not all Jews are twice-divorced, self-loathing urban types suffering from deep existential angst. I, for one, have not spent my life tormented by a crippling lack of self-esteem. But thanks in no small part to the images presented in the films of Mr. Allen, non-Jews continue to perceive us as manic-depressive nebbishes who wallow in our own despair and misery."" Though Klosterman acknowledged that he had not yet seen Waltzing With Schopenhauer, he said that based on what he knows of the film, ""it looks like Allen is up to his old tricks."" ""In the trailer, Allen is berated by his two ex-wives, moderates an imaginary debate in his bathroom between Bix Beiderbecke and Sidney Bechet, and whines about how his favorite deli hasn't been the same since it was purchased by a Japanese investment group,"" Klosterman said. ""If that doesn't tell you something, nothing will."" In the film, Allen's lead character is forced into retirement when Columbia replaces him with a younger, non-tenured professor. Attempting to make the best of the situation by indulging in his favorite pastimes, reading Kafka and attending Bergman film festivals, Hirschhorn soon grows bored and doubtful, eventually questioning his long-held perceptions of life. Vowing to ""strip away all those silly old beliefs and start from scratch,"" he takes a job as a clerk at a Coney Island amusement park. While there, he is tormented by vivid flashbacks and recollections of his childhood and previous marriages. The supporting cast includes Edward Norton, Jeff Goldblum, Minnie Driver, Kathy Bates, Gretchen Mol, Alan Alda, Louise Lasser, Carol Kane, John Glover, Bob Balaban, Bill Paxton, Laura San Giacomo, Lisa Kudrow, Stanley Tucci, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Janeane Garofalo, Miriam Margolyes, Judy Davis, John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Anjelica Huston, Peter Fonda, Forest Whitaker, Susan Sarandon, Tim Robbins, Anne Heche, Jason Alexander, George Segal, Dianne Wiest and Jeanne Tripplehorn. Appearing on PBS' Charlie Rose Monday, longtime Allen producer Jean Doumanian defended the film. ""The fact that the JADL hasn't even seen Waltzing With Schopenhauer makes its condemnation all the more absurd, because the movie is actually a string of charming vignettes about life in New York,"" Doumanian said. ""For example, there's an absolutely delicious scene in Washington Square in which Leon Trotsky and Frida Kahlo dance to Bunny Berrigan's 'King Porter Stomp.'"" Nevertheless, according to an inside source speaking on condition of anonymity, Waltzing's distributor, Sony Pictures Classics, has threatened to withhold the film from release unless Allen removes or alters several scenes that could be construed as offensive to Jews. ""Sony is pressuring Allen to make significant script changes, including a totally new ending, in which an old high-school friend runs into Reuben and convinces him to move to his Jewish, upper middle-class Denver suburb. Freed from the angst that dominates his Manhattan life, Reuben opens a bookstore/coffee shop, which becomes very popular. Energized by his newfound success, he marries his attractive blonde assistant and overcomes his destructive obsessions with existentialism, art and early jazz, abandoning such longtime heroes as Freud and Marx for more positive, contemporary Jewish role models like Steven Spielberg and Calvin Klein."" Allen issued a brief statement about the controversy. ""Jesus,"" Allen said. ""This is ridiculous. I mean, did they tell Kierkegaard, 'Hey, lay off on that 'existence precedes essence' stuff'it won't play in the suburbs and besides, there's no merchandising hook'? I mean, Calvin Klein? Why not Aaron Spelling? Or the Golem? Or, better yet, Albert Speer? Jesus.""","entertainment, celebrities, movies, religion, prejudice, news, vol 35 issue 41, entertainment"

3747,National Funk Congress Deadlocked On Get Up/Get Down Issue,"CHOCOLATE CITY'After months of ceaseless debate, including last week's record 76-hour filibuster slap-bass solo from Senate Rubber Band Minority Leader Bootsy Collins (D-OH), the National Funk Congress is no closer to resolving its deadlock over the controversial ""get up/get down"" issue, insiders reported Monday. ""Get up-uh, get on up! Get up-uh, get on up!"" shouted Getuplican Party supporters on the steps of the Capitol as the debate, as well as a massive 14-piece instrumental jam, raged within. The pro-up-getting demonstrators' chants were nearly drowned out by those of a nearby group of jungle-boogie Downocrats, who called upon all citizens to ""Get down, get down!"" The bitter ""get up/get down"" battle, which has polarized the nation's funk community, is part of a long-running battle between the two factions, rooted in more than 35 years of conflict over the direction in which the American people should shake it. ""The time has come to face facts: To move forward, we've got to get on up, and stay on the scene, like a sex machine,"" said Brick House Majority Leader James Brown (G-GA), one of getting on up's most vocal supporters. ""Say it loud: Only when we have gotten up offa that thing will we, as a nation, finally get back on the good foot."" Upon learning of Brown's remarks, Downocratic leaders openly questioned his commitment to getting up. Said Robert ""Kool"" Bell, a top-ranking Brick House Downocrat: ""It is a well-known fact that Brown has, on many past occasions, urged his supporters to get down with they bad selves. In response to his inconsistent voting record and history of waffling on this crucial issue, we will not rest until every American, as is their birthright, has gotten down."" ""You got to get down,"" Bell added. ""Hyuh!"" The disagreement, which has paralyzed all efforts of the National Funk Congress to get it together and get funky for one and all, has reached crisis proportions, experts say. ""Until our country's funky leaders can resolve this deadlock, U.S. funk leadership, and the booties of all Americans, will remain immobilized,"" said Gregory Tate, domestic motorbooty-affairs reporter for The Washington Funkenquarterly. ""Unless a compromise can be reached soon, the entire nation's thang could be in serious jeopardy."" ""Our leaders' refusal to budge, let alone move it from front to back, has crippled the move-your-body politic,"" said current U.S. Mothership Ambassador George Clinton, one of the most outspoken critics of the deadlock. ""These legislators must keep it real and understand that no matter what party policy may dictate, they cannot fake the funk. What the partisan people in the House need to realize is this: If they ain't gon' get along, the time has come for them to take they dead ass home."" But despite such pleas for bipartisan compromise, the two parties remain at odds. This week, a Getuplican high-treble scratch-guitar initiative called for all Downocrats to ""give it up and turn it loose,"" sparking an angry war of words on the Senate dance floor. In response, the Downocratic members of the Grooves & Booties Subcommittee drafted a bass-heavy resolution demanding that the initiative be voted ""down, down, all the way down."" The Getuplican-Downocratic rift has been further complicated by confusing rhetoric from both sides. A call from Parliamentary leaders to ""get up for the down stroke"" was interpreted by members of both parties as a statement of support. Equally unclear was a statement made earlier this week by Funky Chinatown Big Boss-Elect Carl Douglas, who baffled observers with the assertion that Funky Chinamen were ""chopping men up and chopping men down."" For all the confusion and divisiveness, there are signs of hope. A bipartisan coalition of funky drummers is gaining strength, urging Downocrats and Getuplicans to find common ground by ""getting together, on the one."" Also on the rise is a small grass-roots campaign calling upon party people not to get up or down, but simply to get it on. Whether any of these fledgling reform movements will have a genuine impact on the entrenched groove machine is uncertain. One thing, however, is not: A growing number of citizens are fed up with the nation's current leadership for putting party politics before the need of the people to turn this mother out. ""Big government has lost sight of the fact that we should not be divided along Getuplican and Downocratic lines, but should be one nation under a groove, getting down'or up'just for the funk of it,"" said Clinton at a recent Mothership rally calling for an end to the deadlock. ""The point is not that we must get up or down, but rather that, working together, we've got to get over.""","entertainment, government, music, congress, summer music, news, vol 35 issue 39, entertainment"

Cruise, universally admired for his sly, charismatic grin and stunning good looks, and wife Kidman, who has garnered worldwide acclaim for her breathtaking beauty, were reportedly in the hotel ""for some reason"" and traversed the lobby ""to exit it and leave"" when Access Hollywood captured their beautiful images. ""They were definitely at the location with their actual physical persons undoubtedly present,"" a statement from producers of the popular syndicated infotainment program read in part. ""Luckily, our cameras were there to verify the momentous event and broadcast it, without delay, to as many people as humanly possible."" By all reports resplendent in designer Versace ensembles, Cruise and Kidman, married in 1990 in a hush-hush Christmas Eve ceremony following a whirlwind courtship, kept their ravishing gazes fixed breathtakingly toward the floor during their brief passage from one end of the lobby to the other. They then entered the back of a waiting car and were driven away, bringing the star-studded lobby walk to an end. ""It was magical. They were in rare form, giving the revolving door just enough of a push to set it in motion, exhibiting the grace, style and poise for which they have become so renowned,"" said Ellen Donahue, an unremarkable nobody who happened to be in the lobby at the time. ""And you could totally tell it was them, because of all the cameras and everything."" The gorgeous Kidman and her hunky husband set tongues wagging with their attention-grabbing lobby walk, Access Hollywood host Pat O'Brien said in a nationally televised statement. ""Hollywood's hottest real-life lovebirds were at it again yesterday,"" he told viewers Tuesday, ""walking through a lobby with their unmistakable style, on their way to someplace fascinating and exciting.""

But first, Access Hollywood correspondent Bob Reese catches up with everybody's favorite Eight Is Enough star, Dick Van Patten."" The program then segued into a feature showcasing Van Patten and his family at a celebrity charity rollerblading event. Response to the Hollywood power couple's lobby walk has been overwhelming. Film critic Michael Medved called Cruise's confident, deliberate stride'immortalized in such blockbusters as The Color Of Money, Rain Man and A Few Good Men'""a smashing return to form for Tom Terrific after the fizzle of the Stanley Kubrick box-office bomb Eyes Wide Shut."" Celebrity-watchers added that Kidman, who met Cruise on the set of Days Of Thunder, more than held her own during the 15-second stroll, matching her heartthrob husband's million-megawatt star power with the grace and confidence that have earned her the respect and admiration of critics and moviegoers alike around the globe. ""It was wonderful,"" said Irene Davis, a Bristol, CT, plebian who saw the couple's lobby walk on television. ""Normally I'd never have a chance to rub elbows with the likes of Tom and Nic, but thanks to Access Hollywood's exclusive, inside peek at the comings and goings of Movieland's hottest couple, I got to feel like I was right there in the lobby with them."" Despite the raves from the public, some celebrity-watchers are unimpressed with the lobby stroll. ""This was a real disappointment, coming from stars of Cruise and Kidman's magnitude,"" New York Post gossip columnist Liz Smith said. ""In the past, we've seen much more impressive lobby-walks from both'dressed to the nines, waving at cameras and smiling at crowds at restaurants, gala benefits and award shows. But this time, it seemed like they were just phoning it in. Frankly, I'm unwowed."" ""The least he could have done was give a thumbs-up to the camera,"" Smith added. ""C'mon, TomEE Your fans deserve more!""onetheless, O'Dell said, the general consensus is that Cruise and Kidman have done it again, proving that ""when it comes to walking across the surface area of a lobby floor, they're at the top of the Hollywood heap."" Cruise, currently filming Mission: Impossible 2, is expected to walk through at least three more lobbies before beginning work on Minority Report, a Steven Spielberg sci-fi thriller with a Christmas 2000 release date. And, according to Kidman publicist Lisette Rose, the Aussie actress, who is following up her buttock-baring performance in the Broadway hit The Blue Room with the psychological horror flick The Others, has ""a very busy schedule"" but has not ruled out the possibility of appearing on a Rodeo Drive sidewalk ""sometime soon.""""o","entertainment, celebrities, media, news, vol 35 issue 32, entertainment"
3758,"Upcoming Los Angeles Earthquake 'Will Be Huge,' Insiders Say","LOS ANGELES'Here in the glamour capital of the world, people are used to high-profile, earth-shattering events. But according to top insiders, publicists and seismologists, the long-awaited Los Angeles earthquake, due to arrive soon after decades of delays, is going to be the biggest thing to hit town in a long, long time. ""The pressure is on, and when this thing hits the streets, it's gonna turn this town upside down,"" Daily Variety's Marvin Demofsky said. ""People have been waiting for it for years, and when those tectonic plates finally get ready to move on this, it's going to generate a lot of buzz. Believe the hype: This one is going to blow you away."" ""Get ready to rumble, L.A.!"" said popular gossip columnist Rita Jaynes of The Hollywood Reporter. ""This thing is gonna tear the roof off box offices all across town!"" Though the groundswell of anticipation for the earthquake has been building for ages, the recent discovery of a series of highly unstable ""blind thrust"" faults directly beneath downtown L.A. has caused the hype to reach a fever pitch. So-called ""slip-strike"" faults, such as the famed San Andreas Fault, move horizontally, with the land masses sliding past each other. But thrust faults, like the newly discovered Hollywood Fault and Elysian Park Fault'on which Dodger Stadium stands'are much more destructive because they move diagonally and even vertically, ""thrusting"" masses of earth up and down and folding enormous sections underneath the surface itself. ""This quake should pull in big, big numbers on the Richter Scale. Not only is the potential for long-term impact large, but the opening weekend is almost certainly going to be a record-setter for casualties. I mean, this is going to open huge,"" said Dr. John Shaw, a Harvard structural geologist who last May helped discover the Puente Hills Fault, the largest of these hidden thrust faults, beneath L.A.'s most populated areas. ""This is the sort of groundbreaking event that can really shatter expectations and shake up the industry."" The earthquake, which publicists are hyping as ""a major motion event,"" is expected not only to strike it big with the coveted 18-to-34 demographic, but also prove just as powerful with all other age groups, as well. ""This one is going to reach everyone: kids, young professionals, the over-50 crowd,"" publicist Shayna Glickman said. ""We're talking record-breaking numbers of whites, blacks, Hispanics; you name 'em, they're going to be in on this quake."" ""Everybody's going to be talking about this one,"" Jaynes said. ""Advance word is that this quake is going to be inescapable. Talk about your show-stoppers: It's going to be like Armageddon, Deep Impact and Volcano all rolled into one."" Today, scientists know far more about the immense geological forces at work under L.A. than they did a few years ago. Nevertheless, much remains unknown about the event researchers at USC's Southern California Earthquake Center have given the working preproduction title L.A. Quake: The Big One. The project is so hush-hush, in fact, that no release date has yet been finalized, as scientists still have no way of predicting exactly when it will hit theaters, restaurants and homes. Seismologists say the epicenter will most likely be somewhere within the 25-mile corridor from the city's downtown business district to the base of Pasadena's San Gabriel mountains. The area contains such glamorous establishments as the tony Wolfgang Puck eatery Spago, after-hours hotspot The Viper Room, and the ultra-exclusive Burke Williams day spa and massage center, adding to the quake's growing reputation as ""the"" place to be on opening weekend, whenever that may be. Though comparisons are already being made with the earthquake that recently killed record numbers in Turkey, industry insiders say the L.A. quake will be bigger and better, pointing to its ""superior production values"" and noting that foreign quakes have never garnered much attention from American audiences. ""A 7.0 quake in the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area would potentially kill millions and cause upwards of $1 trillion in damages,"" said Julian Franks, media liaison for the quake. ""The Turkish quake may have had a huge death toll, but the damage wasn't anywhere near $1 trillion, what with no BMWs or gleaming skyscrapers in the area. And the L.A. one will boast superior locations, costumes and lighting, not to mention a better-looking cast and a much bigger budget. Plus, it'll be in English."" But not everyone is so confident. With the two tectonic plates sliding past each other at the rate of five inches per year, some say the advance build-up may actually work against the quake. ""All this hype could prove to be a real disaster,"" Paramount executive Herb Gregory said. ""In this post-Blair Witch era, bigger isn't always better. People don't want things on a massive scale anymore, and the backlash aftershocks from this huge quake could really hurt the industry. In a worst-case scenario, we could be looking at the next Godzilla."" But despite such naysayers, a majority of Angelenos are predicting a giant smash. ""It's got everything: action, drama, heartacheEE What could go wrong?""ollywood executive Belinda Petersen said. ""Besides, it's a casting director's dream: practically everybody who is anybody in this town is going to be involved.""nn","entertainment, patriotism, environment, news, vol 35 issue 31, entertainment"

3767,Insane Clown Posse Gets Ride To Concert From Mom,"ROYAL OAK, MI'Despite last-minute fears of a concert cancellation due to transportation problems'as well as the fact that it was a school night'Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope, the shock-rock rappers known as Insane Clown Posse, managed to make it to their Monday performance at Detroit's Joe Louis Arena after securing a ride from 2 Dope's mom. ""Man, we were so worried we wouldn't be able to get to the concert,"" J told several social-studies classmates Tuesday. ""That would've sucked big-time, because we'd been looking forward to it for, like, weeks and weeks, and all our friends were gonna be there. Luckily, Shaggy's mom totally came through for us, even if she can be a total bitch sometimes."" The duo, whose The Amazing Jeckel Brothers album made its debut at #4 on the Billboard charts earlier this year, was ""really grateful"" for the ride, promising to mow the lawn and perform several other household chores in return. Despite the successful outcome, the pair nearly missed the concert: At approximately 7 p.m., J's mom backed out of her promise to give them a ride, explaining that she had to drive J's sister Stephanie to the mall. When the popular recording group protested, J's mom allegedly told her son, ""Maybe you should've thought about how much you didn't want to miss your concert when you forgot to take out the garbage for the third week in a row, even though you were reminded over and over again."" ""That sucked ass, big-time,"" said J at a poolside press conference. ""I can't believe she went so crazy just over some stupid garbage. That shit was so wack! She played herself like a straight-up bitch!"" Immediately following the press conference, J was informed that he wouldn't be allowed to use the pool with his friends if he couldn't refrain from using such language in reference to his own mother. ""Sorry, Mom,"" replied J before silently flipping off his mother once her back was turned. ""Taking out the garbage sucks ass,"" J added under his breath. J and 2 Dope, who describe themselves as ""psychotic serial killas"" and ""mad ninja gangstas,"" are no strangers to controversy. Their 1997 Island Records debut, The Great Milenko, drew fire from religious and moral watchdogs for its ""shockingly violent and depraved lyrical content,"" and had already been pulled from release by another label. More recently, the duo has come under fire from teachers and school administrators for frequent tardiness, ""poor attitude"" and failing grades in math class, as well as refusal to ""dress out"" for gym. ""It's such total bullshit that we have to take stupid summer school instead of being in the studio where we belong, just because of some stupid history tests,"" 2 Dope said. ""Summer school is for fucking tools."" Despite the ongoing controversy surrounding Insane Clown Posse, 2 Dope's mom defended her decision to give the group a ride. ""I know some parents wouldn't feel comfortable letting their children perform at a concert like this,"" she said. ""But I know they're just going through a phase. Two years ago, Shaggy's older sister Tracy couldn't stop talking about Marilyn Manson, but she grew out of that. It's important to let them figure these things out for themselves."" Concerned that 2 Dope's mom would insist on attending the concert with them, humiliating them in front of their friends, J and 2 Dope convinced her to drop them off and pick them up later. This was key, a spokesman for Island Records said, because the lack of parental supervision freed the duo to ""go totally wild"" at the sold-out arena show. ""I made sure they both took a sweater in case they got chilly up there on stage, and on the way we stopped off at the gas station to pick up some extra Faygo pop, which is their favorite,"" 2 Dope's mom said. ""They wanted me to drop them off a block away, so they could go and make their famous entrance from the padded wagon without anyone seeing me. So I just helped them into their straitjackets, and off they went."" 2 Dope's mom added that she had taken extra-special effort to wash and starch the pair's trademark straitjackets ahead of time ""to make sure they'd look nice for all the people at the show."" Witnesses reported seeing 2 Dope attempt to exit his mother's car without hugging her goodbye, saying, ""C'mon, mom, all the Juggalos are gonna make fun of me!"" But after being reminded that he was ""not too big to give his mother a hug,"" he relented, eliciting jeers and boos from the many 14-year-old boys present. ""God, that was embarrassing,"" 2 Dope said. ""And the whole way there, she wouldn't shut up about, 'Be sure to call me before 10:30 to pick you up,' and, 'Tone down the violent lyrics: Remember, that's just the sort of thing that got you dropped from [Walt Disney subsidiary] Hollywood [Records].' It was so annoying, I wanted to pull out a machete and just go buck-wild on the bitch's ass, slicin' and dicin' like a maniac psycho-killa ninja, motherfucka! Yeahh, boyee!"" ""It was kind of nice of her to pack us those Fruit Roll-Ups, though,"" 2 Dope conceded. ""Thanks, mom.""","entertainment, kids, music, parents, teenagers, news, vol 35 issue 27, entertainment"

3771,Today's New Age Music Is Crap,"Boy, nothing stays good for long, that's all I can say. I went to Falling Water Books & Music right after work Tuesday, because I'd heard the new David Lanz CD was finally out. So I shelled out my $15.99, and raced home to listen. And you know what? It fucking blew. I'm not kidding. David Lanz has let us all down. The first three tracks, I'm like, ""Okay, this is kind of derivative of the earlier stuff like Heartsounds or Nightfall, but he's probably just reacquainting us with the style before hitting us with the new shit."" And then the next five tracksEE I don't even know how to say it. It sucked. I'm like, "" this the same David Lanz who put out Woodlands?"" Believe me, I wish it were only The Lanz. But it's all of them. The golden age of New Age music has come and gone. I remember when I first heard Yanni, back in '85. It was my junior year of high school. One Saturday night, I was hanging out at my buddy Steve's, and he looks at me and says, ""Dude, you gotta hear this record. This shit will blow your mind."" So I'm like, ""Okay, whatever, Steve."" So he puts this LP on, and I hear the first notes of Optimystique come out of the speaker. Needless to say, my jaw hit the floor. It was like the moment in The Wizard Of Oz where everything goes from black-and-white to color. The next day, I bought my own copy, and I listened to it for like 24 hours straight. I didn't get to sleep until, like, 4 a.m., so I skipped school the next day and just played Optimystique non-stop. I actually wore out the needle, moving it back to listen to ""Butterfly Dance"" over and over again. After that, New Age pretty much became my life. I started devouring the old masters like Cluster, Tangerine Dream and Kitaro. I spent all the money I made at my pizza-delivery job on New Age, and when that wasn't enough, I started mowing lawns. Then came my college years. The gang on my floor at the dorm would stay up all night playing the coolest shit, like Angels Of Venice and Gordon Burnham. We'd go through a whole box of Celestial Seasonings Red Zinger in a night. Once, we rented a van and drove all the way to Vermont just to see John Anderson live. That was back when I was dating Alicia Leupke just because she looked a little like Enya. That was back when New Age was a real thing. Back when Windham Hill Records was an exciting new upstart indie label. Now they've sold out and are doing all these Beatles tributes and jazz festivals. They've forgotten what it's all about. It used to be about the New Age music! Now, it's just about having the hottest stars and promoting them. Or getting that next album finished in time, to satisfy the record executives who don't even care if it's any good, so long as it's done on time. I mean, can you name one track on Chris Spheeris' last album? I didn't think so. I was out with this chick a month ago, and she asked me what kind of music I was into, so I said New Age, and she goes, ""Oh, I just love John Tesh."" I'm like, what the fuck?!?! That shit isn't New Age! New Age is about harmony with nature! It's about ambience and calming down! Not about some Hollywood pretty-boy banging on his Casio! I hear Tesh doesn't even have real ocean sounds'that's all synthesized, too. Frankly, none of these idiots on the charts nowadays know the first thing about the true spirit of New Age. I mean, Bruce BecVar? Where was Bruce BecVar during the harmonic convergence of 1987? Moussing his hair, most likely. And what about all these bands that are wearing a different crystal in every photo? They're using crystals for fashion purposes, not for focusing their personal, unchanging chakras! I swear, these poseurs wouldn't know the voice of Seth if they channeled it! It's all been downhill since December by George Winston. A great album, no question, but it was too successful and went mainstream. Then all the phonies came out of the woodwork, the big labels wanted in, and the next thing you know, the scene is totally ruined, turned into a giant, money-sucking corporate whore-beast. I know what you're gonna say: ""What about Dreamsea? They're independent."" Yeah, but it's so obvious that their whole goal is to sell out. Look how they're promoting Book Of Dreams, talking them up like they're the next Secret Garden or something. Yeah, right'they sound more like me and Steve screwing around in the garage with our flute and harp back in high school. They just want to get a million-seller so they can whore themselves to Time-Warner, you just know it. Ah, well. I guess I'll always have Optimystique.

3780,New Television Show In The Works,"BURBANK, CA'A possible new television program is ""in the works,"" with preliminary meetings regarding a potential development deal with UPN ""a definite possibility,"" sources at the extreme periphery of the U.S. entertainment industry confirmed Monday. ""Imagine, a new TV show,"" Daily Variety reporter Brent Klarman said. ""I can't tell you what a staggering impact this could have on the lives of the nation's 200 million television viewers. This is big. It's not every day somebody comes up with an idea for a new TV series."" The program, described by co-creator Rob Frankel as ""a comedy at this phase, but it could be possibly a drama, too, depending on what the fax we get next Tuesday suggests,"" has drawn interest from ""more than one major network."" Frankel noted that ""higher-ups"" at UPN have already seen the initial script and will likely be getting back to him sometime soon, possibly even later this week. According to Frankel and co-creator Daniel Black, if funding can be found and a pilot made, the new program could hit the airwaves as early as next fall. If so, it would become one of just 600 to 700 shows to debut this year and could become a development of great importance to the nation's broadcast industry, with syndication rights alone worth tens of millions, maybe. Currently being developed under the working title Livin' 'N Learnin', the new show will, once a first-draft script is worked out, probably examine the trials and tribulations of three young professionals struggling to make it in Los Angeles. Though none of the characters have yet to be given names, the three central protagonists have been narrowed down to an attractive, 27-year-old white man with brown hair who wants to be a TV writer; an attractive, 25-year-old white woman with blonde hair who is studying to be a chef and may or may not fall in love with the aspiring TV writer in Season Two; and an attractive, 26-year-old African-American or Asian man or woman who will be a schoolteacher, an aspiring actor, or gay. ""This really sounds like the kind of program people might enjoy, I think,"" said Chad Locke, who, if all goes well, will use his position as assistant mailroom clerk at UPN to leave the script where UPN president Dean Valentine is likely to see it. Locke, who roomed with the show's co-creators two summers ago while at USC Film School, is confident that the potential series' hilarious-yet-touching look at the problems facing 18- to 34-year-olds today will ""really resonate with UPN's core audience."" But even if the UPN plan does not pan out, Frankel said, ""there are still a lot of other options."" There are the people he knows at Fox and Comedy Central, as well as an intern at Paramount TV who ""owes me big-time,"" all of whom could prove valuable as contacts. Black, whose uncle once appeared on an episode of Lost In Space, also knows a guy who knows Joss Whedon. And in 1994, Frankel served a reuben sandwich to one of the top entertainment lawyers in Hollywood and gave him his card. ""Plus,"" Frankel said, ""we have really good relationships with the agencies. Not that it was easy establishing those contacts, but sending out all of those fruit baskets really helped establish a viable rapport."" Television critics have already begun speculating about the show, with anticipation for what might eventually become the first new TV show in three to four days building to a fever pitch. ""Will one guy be mistaken for another guy, resulting in a complex series of hijinks that ruins one of the characters' Big Date?"" USA Today TV critic Matt Walsh asked. ""Or will a dramatic confrontation about some woman's courageous battle with an eating disorder bring all of the characters closer together? There's only one way to know for sureEE by watching Livin' 'N Learnin', when and if it ever airs, on some network, someday.""merica's TV-viewing public is equally excited. ""A new show? That sounds pretty good,"" said Fred Lundegard, an Akron, OH, tile-warehouse manager. ""I'd sure like it if there were some different shows I could watch."" Despite standing on the verge of potential fame and fortune, Frankel and Green stressed that they remain the same down-to-earth people they have always been. ""We're not going to suddenly change just because we have this big TV show in the works,"" Frankel said. ""Sure, it's impressive, but if we lose touch with the little people around us, the show might lose what makes it special: that human quality. You can't fake that."" Black agreed.

3783,I Don't Even Remember Writing The Tommyknockers,"So, I'm doing this book signing for The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon at the Barnes & Noble on Manhattan's Upper West Side last week, and this woman comes up to me, gushing about how The Tommyknockers is her ""absolute, all-time favorite book."" The name really didn't ring a bell, but I figured I must have written it, seeing as this woman is bothering to tell me how it's her all-time favorite, so I just kind of play along like I know what the heck she's talking about. ""What Bobbi Anderson and the other people of Haven went through, well, that was just the ultimate in horror fiction,"" this woman said to me as I nodded along, clueless. ""I must have read it at least 50 times, and I swear, not once has it failed to scare the living daylights out of me."" Anyway, when I got home, I looked up The Tommyknockers in this literature reference book I have and, sure enough, I wrote it in 1987. Apparently, it's the story of this woman in this small town in Maine who discovers a metal object that was buried for millennia, and the thing gives all the townspeople super-powers. But then there's this deadly evil that's unleashed by the object, and the town becomes a death trap for all outsiders. After reading the plot synopsis, I sort of remembered it, but, then again, maybe it just sounded like something else I wrote. After your 50 or 60th one, it's all kind of a blur. But if I had to venture a guess, I'd say I probably did write The Tommyknockers. It sounds like my kind of thing, what with this invisible evil being unleashed on a town full of innocent people and all. To be honest, that wouldn't be the first time I'd forgotten one of my books. I'm usually pretty good about remembering the early stuff, like Carrie and The Stand and so forth. And I never forget my most recent one. It's those middle-period ones, though, that always seem to slip my mind. Like, what's that one about the writer who uses a pen name, and then the pen name develops into this evil, Mr. Hyde-type alter ego and commits a brutal murder? The Dark Tower? The Dark Zone? I'm pretty sure it's the ""Dark"" something, but I could be wrong. Oh, and then there was that one about the werewolf. I honestly don't remember anything about that one, except that there was some kind of killer werewolf attacking a whole bunch of people. Hopefully, no one will ever mention that one at a book signing, because I don't think I could fake it for even a minute. Like I said, it's all a big blur after a while.","opinion, entertainment, commentary, vol 35 issue 17, stephen king, entertainment"

3785,HBO Presentation Fails To Deliver Promised 'Brief Nudity',"JACKSON, MS'As far as local resident Nate Childress can tell, the ""brief nudity"" promised in the HBO original movie Total Disclosure was not delivered at any point during the 93-minute film. ""Were they talking about when you could see that one girl's bare back?"" Childress asked. ""Or maybe they meant the part where you could almost sort of see that blonde girl's ass through the panties. If that's what they meant, that's bullshit."" Childress said the brief nudity may have occurred during the 10 seconds when he raced to the kitchen for a beer, but noted that he went for the beer during a scene set in a police station. ""I highly doubt that any girls took their clothes off during the 10 seconds of police interrogating that I missed,"" he said.","entertainment, sex, tv, news in brief, vol 35 issue 15, entertainment"
3786,"You Know, I Used To Be Kind Of Cool Once","You know how, every so often, something you haven't thought about in the longest time will just sort of pop up out of nowhere, and all of a sudden you're like, ""HeyEE Wait a minute""Well, that happened to me last week, when it occurred to me that I actually used to sort of be cool once. I guess, like everybody else, I've gotten used to thinking of myself as, you know, one of those guys on VH1. Some vaguely ""adult contemporary"" artist like Billy Joel or Elton John or somebody. The sort of musician you'd find your dad listening to or hear really quietly in the background at the bank. I mean, ""cool"" is the last thing I'd normally think of myself as being. Looking at it now, who would think that the composer of ""If I Ever Lose My Faith In You"" used to be cool? Sounds crazy, huh? It seems ridiculous, but it's true. I was kind of hip, in a way, if you think about it. Isn't that just so weird? It hit me the other day, and it was like, ""Whoa'that's so bizarre."" I was sitting at one of my pianos, working out some chords for my forthcoming album The Tepid Heart, when the wife asked me to pick up some diet soda. Since the staff was off (it was a Sunday), and the kids were due home from football practice soon, I said sure and drove down to the cornershop. When I got there, the kid behind the counter had a tape playing that sounded oddly familiar. It wasn't really my cup of tea'polyrhythmic and uptempo, with intense emotional energy and electrically amplified guitars instead of acoustic. And the kid was, to be honest, playing it a bit loud. But instead of being annoyed, I found it compelling in a weird sort of way. When I asked the kid who it was, he said he'd found it in a bag of stuff that used to belong to his older brother. ""It's old, but I like it,"" he said. ""It's kind of reggae, but it sounds punk, too."" Well, several weeks went by, but it kept nagging at me. Then, finally, last Thursday, I figured it out. I was in the den, watching some figure skating on TV and reading Parade. (Isn't it funny how these things always hit you at the oddest times?) Anyway, there was an article about a policewoman who volunteers teaching schoolchildren about pet safety, when suddenly, it clicked: That kid was listening to Outlandos d'Amour, the first record by my old band, The Police! Now, I know what you're thinking: ""WowEE I haven't thought about The Police in years.""nd neither had I, but you know what? It sounds nothing like what you'd expect after hearing ""Fields Of Gold."" At first, I thought, ""WaitEE Is this just my memory playing tricks on me? I mean, I recorded the love theme from The Three Musketeers with Bryan Adams and Rod Stewart, for Christ's sake. How cool could I possibly be?""ut then I dusted off a bunch of the old LPs and, boy, was I amazed. Those records were actually pretty rockin'! You wouldn't think that kind of stuff would come from me, but, hey, the opening track, ""Next To You""? Come on! And the rest of the album, too: ""So Lonely,"" ""Born In the '50s,"" and you've got to admit that ""Sally Be My Girl"" is one cool song. I was like, ""Did I write this stuff? No way!"" Come to think of it, I did lots of cool things back then. Sure, now we all think of me as starring in duds like The Bride, but I was in Quadrophenia, too. Heck, I was even in Urgh! A Music War. Remember that one? I'd totally forgotten until now. Man, I used to watch that on USA Network's Night Flight back in the '80s, and I just thought it was so awesome. It had X and Devo back when they were really punk. Even the Go-Go's were hardcore in that show! Shit, man, things sure do change. And it wasn't just the early years. The whole Police catalog was pretty cool. I mean, the chorus on that one song, what was it, ""My wife has burned the scrambled eggs / The dog just bit my leg / My teenage daughter ran away / My fine young son has turned out gay""? That one actually had the mosh-pit kids slamming. Can you believe it? Teenagers, moshing to me of all people! Sure, nowadays, most people think of ""(Don't Stand So) Close To Me"" as a deodorant commercial, but at the time, it was pretty out there, what with the whole Nabokov-pedophilia thing. I know the idea of me being cool doesn't seem to make sense (it didn't to me at first, either), but just listen to those albums. Even Synchronicity isn't bad, and I didn't start really laming out until ""(Don't Stand So) Close To Me '86."" Go figure, I guess. Then again, Eric Clapton, of ""Tears In Heaven"" fame, really used to tear it up, too, come to think of it. Or, hell, just take Paul Westerberg. Now there's one to ponder. Makes you wonder, you know? I mean, I guess it just really goes to show you..ha  h","opinion, entertainment, celebrities, human interest, music, commentary, vol 35 issue 15, sting, entertainment"

3789,WB Targets Booming U.S. Prison Population With New Sitcom,"LOS ANGELES'Responding to the explosive growth of the U.S. prison population, WB executives announced Monday that the network will soon launch a new sitcom targeting the nation's approximately 1.8 million incarcerated TV viewers. ""America is fast becoming the most jailed nation on Earth, with prisons packed to capacity and a swamped, inefficient judicial system that is ill-equipped to keep pace with the ever-growing crime rate. Clearly, something had to be done,"" said WB vice-president of programming Grant Bachman. ""And what better way to address this serious crisis than with the outrageous new comedy In Da Yard!, debuting this week as part of the WB's 'Lock-Down Thursdays'?"" ""U.S. prisoners,"" Bachman added, ""represent a powerful demographic that this nation's entertainment industry can no longer afford to ignore."" Described in WB promotional literature as ""a hysterical look at the nutty goings-on in a typical American maximum-security federal correctional facility,"" In Da Yard! will give the nation's nearly two million convicts the chance to ""follow the weekly adventures of a zany bunch of hardened killers, drug offenders, B&E men and wacky, psychotic rapos"" just like themselves. ""It's basically a show about living and learning in the '90s in prison,"" Bachman said. Advance advertising figures for the show are said to be ""very promising,"" with several high-profile accounts already secured and airtime pre-sold for most of the show's initial six-week run. ""U.S. inmates spend more than $5 billion in cigarettes each year, using them to buy everything from toilet paper and de-lousing shampoo to playing cards and dice,"" said Bryce Kelso of Advertising Age. ""They're a prime, untapped consumer market that any smart advertiser would want to reach. The fact is, every day this vast market continues to go untargeted is millions more dollars in lost revenue. That's a harsh economic reality, and we cannot turn a blind eye to it. It must be faced."" Added Kelso: ""Do you realize that the average rapist is out on the street and in stores in just five years?"" The first six episodes of In Da Yard!, WB officials said, have been extensively focus-grouped on a wide variety of felons at some 70 maximum-security facilities across the U.S. The show has reportedly scored high among all major prison demographics, from armed robbers to child molesters. Particularly popular among focus groups was the debut episode, in which main character Detroit Ray, sentenced to life without parole for the murder of his wise-cracking landlord, finds himself desperately trying to fend off impending group anal-rape in the prison shower. ""It's great, over-the-top physical comedy,"" WB president Dan Vittolo said. ""And it really seemed to hit test audiences where they live."" Future plotlines include a side-splitting mix-up when Ray's buddy Jorge pretends to be his ""bitch"" to impress a visiting cellmate; Ray slashing the wrong guard ""just because he's too proud to admit he can't see without glasses""; and a full-blown prison riot ""gone totally haywire."" ""I thought there was going to be a riot right there in the screening room after that one,"" Vittolo joked. ""We feel confident that we can provide the swollen, overcrowded ranks of the U.S. prison system with characters and situations they can truly relate to,"" said Miles Forrest, recent Harvard graduate and In Da Yard! head writer. ""The difficulty of sneaking a spoon out of the cafeteria to sharpen on a concrete floor; the silly shenanigans that ensue when someone smuggles in heroin inside their rectum; the overworked, underpaid guards and their nutty, sadistic foibles; and the goofy rivalries between warring, tattooed prison gangs'whatever's funny."" What's more, In Da Yard! executive producer Ira Clausner said, the audience for such prison-themed fare will only grow in the coming years. ""The U.S. prison population has doubled in the past 12 years and will probably do so again over the next 12,"" he said. ""With that kind of grim reality working in our favor, we can't lose. Numbers don't lie, and these alarming figures, the result of years of social neglect and public apathy, paint a very bright picture for the future of the WB."" Vittolo agreed. ""The number of U.S. inmates now stands at an all-time high,"" he said. ""We'd be fools to just stand around and watch things get worse without lifting a finger to capitalize on the situation.""","entertainment, crime, tv, television, news, vol 35 issue 13, entertainment"

The lights! The glamour! The dresses! Oh, it was a night to remember! Everyone was dressed to the nines. Even Hollywood's most notorious tough guy, Jack Nicholson, looked positively dapper in his tuxedo. (And I bet it wasn't a rental!) Someday, I hope to be there in person so I can take in all the glory first-hand. But in the meantime, I'm happy to sit at home with a bowl of Jolly Time buttered popcorn and watch the proceeds unfoldEf live! The only problem I had with this year's Oscars was that I didn't know who half the people were. While I have faith in the Academy's ability to decide who should be nominated, I must admit there were some glaring oversights. Where was John Goodman for his star-making turn in The Borrowers? Or Tim Allen for his textured portrayal of an undercover Amish man on the run from the law in For Richer Or For Poorer? And where, oh, where, was veteran funnyman Eddie Murphy, without whom Holy Man would have been a holy mess? Well, all I know for sure is that I've got a whole lot of movies to catch up on. The Many Loves Of William Shakespeare, for example, looks dazzling, especially Gwyneth Barbeau. Item! Everyone knows that Jenny Elfman is a hilarious comedienne""with knockout good looks to boot. But did you know that she's also a very spiritual woman? My sources tell me that she's joined the same church that Tom Cruise and Kirstie Alley belong to, and that the church has filled her deep spiritual void. It must be a pretty great church to attract so many of Hollywood's most glamorous stars. I'll look into it more and see what I can come up with for you. Why is it that every time I find a decent pair of""shoes, the store doesn't have it in my size? Item! The world recently lost one of its greatest, most televised film critics. Of course, I'm talking about the legendary Gene Siskel. Whenever I wanted to know what movie I should see, I only had to look to Gene's trusty thumb for the answer. Now, I guess I'll just have to read other, non-thumb reviews to figure out what to see. Farewell, Gene. Best wishes to you, and give everyone in Heaven a big ""thumbs up"" for me. Especially that Steve McQueen. He was terrific. Boy, that Mariah Carey sure is starting to get big, isn't she? Item! The whole nation was buzzing about The Interview. Now, if you don't know what I'm talking about, you must live in a cave. I'm talking about Barbara Walters' interview with Monica Lewinsky. Well, I watched it expecting to see a shameless little tart, but instead I saw a frail and sensitive woman who was unfairly taken advantage of. And Barbara, as usual, handled it like a real pro, unafraid to ask the tough questions but ever-ready with a handkerchief and a shoulder to cry on. My heart goes out to you, Monica. If you need a friend, please feel free to call or write. My door is always open. How come you never see men wearing dickies any more? Item! Matthew Broderick is h-o-t! Last year, he was in the mega-smash Godzilla, and in 1999, it looks like he's going to be the toast of Tinseltown once again, starring in the year's most anticipated movie! Of course, I'm talking about Star Wars: Episode One'The Shadow Knows. In it, Broderick plays a young Anakin Solo. I know that Broderick is in his 30s, and Anakin is supposed to be 8, but that George Lucas is a real wizard with special effects, so I'm sure he worked his movie magic and took years off Mr. Broderick. I can't wait to ""Force"" my way into my local theater to see that one! Can you believe that a pound of butter costs $4? Unbelievable! Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio? To the grave! That's right, last week, after a prolonged bout with Joe DiMaggio's Disease, the Yankee Schooner finally set sail for that great ballpark in the sky. Jumpin' Joe, with your legendary hitting streak, your long and loving marriage to Marilyn Monroe, and your great work as a Mr. Coffee pitchman, you won't soon be forgotten, that's for sure. Congratulations to piano man Billy Joel for his induction into the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame.

3795,Aspiring Actress' Vagina Photographed,"HOLLYWOOD, CA'In what entertainment-industry insiders are calling ""an exciting new development,"" the vagina of aspiring actress Sierra Nicole Lennox, 20, was photographed Monday from a variety of alluring angles. The photo session is widely regarded as the first step on the road to fame and fortune for the young actress, who film and TV executives throughout the greater Los Angeles area are calling a ""striking, white-hot new talent"" with a ""really great-looking vagina."" ""I'm extremely excited about this latest career move,"" a bathrobed Lennox told reporters shortly after completing principal photography. ""I've already seen some of the initial demo photos and, if I do say so myself, my vagina looks fantastic. But I want everyone to understand that this is only the beginning. Once these pictures of my vagina start getting circulated and creating a 'buzz' around town, I'll be able to move on to what I'm really interested in doing: starring in and perhaps directing major motion pictures."" ""I'm not just another pretty vagina,"" Lennox added. According to semi-professional talent agent Murray Pisarcik, 49, who photographed the young woman's genitals in the basement studio of his Van Nuys home, Lennox's vagina ""definitely has what it takes"" to propel her to Hollywood superstardom. ""Sierra's vagina is really something special. In this town, aspiring starlets are a dime a dozen. But she's not like the other girls you see waiting to be discovered at the counter of the Denny's on Sunset Boulevard,"" Pisarcik said. ""She's got the kind of vagina that just lights up a room."" Lennox, born Dolores Ellen Niehrud, was known as ""the prettiest girl in town"" in her hometown of Olathe, KS, where she was the star of her high-school drama club, starring in Oklahoma!, The Music Man and Pippin before moving on to study theater at Emporia (KS) Community College. Though her talent continued to blossom at ECC, she said she quickly realized her ambitions were bigger than Kansas could hold. Within six months, she was waitressing in L.A. ""Emporia was great, but I soon figured out that Hollywood was where the action was,"" Lennox said. ""I had talent, but I knew I couldn't sit around forever. I had to go for it while the time was ripe. After all, my vagina wasn't getting any younger."" Explaining the decision to have her vagina photographed, Lennox said: ""When you're just starting out like I am, you need to do something special to stand out from the crowd. You need to get yourself noticed and create a 'buzz,' and showing people your vagina is a great way to do that."" Though Pisarcik said he and Lennox are still weighing their options regarding the vaginal pics, the photographer said several ""very attractive offers"" are currently on the table. ""I've got a possible sale already lined up to www.eagerbeaverz.com, and both Gent and Swank have expressed interest,"" Pisarcik said. ""So the industry response is definitely there."" ""Remember this vagina,"" Pisarcik added, holding up an 8x10 glossy of Lennox's pubis. ""Take a good look now, because before long, everybody's who's anybody will recognize it. This vagina's on a one-way rocket-ship ride to the top, baby!"" Industry power players who have seen advance copies of the photos agreed that Lennox's vagina has real star power. ""This is the kind of vagina you see once, maybe twice in a lifetime,"" said Paramount Pictures executive Barry Wolk. ""I predict Sierra Nicole Lennox will be the next Glenn Close. Photos don't lie: That's talent, baby. Sheer, unadulterated talent."" ""Just look at this vagina,"" agreed Andrew Black of 20th Century Fox. ""The camera loves it. With a knockout vagina like this, the girl can't miss."" For all her success, Lennox admitted she had her doubts at first. ""When I first moved to Hollywood, sure, I was scared. I thought, 'What if I'm not good enough? What if people don't like my vagina?'"" she said. ""You hear so many horror stories about how this town eats people alive. But I've found that's all a myth. Everyone I've met has been so supportive and friendly, especially when it comes to taking pictures of my pubic region."" ""I just know I'm going to be a big star,"" Lennox added, smiling brightly. ""All my hard work is finally paying off."" With success and fame just around the corner, Lennox and Pisarcik are planning a weekend getaway to the Tarzana, CA, Motel 6 to reflect on her big break and ponder the next move. ""We're on our way,"" said Pisarcik, packing hurriedly. ""I told Sierra she could make the biggest debut splash since Meryl Streep appeared in Naked Nymphos back in 1976. But we're not letting success go to our heads. We're going to handle this well. Sierra's going to have a lot of decisions to make as far as what projects she wants to take on. As for me, once the money starts rolling in, I'm going to pay my back alimony and take care of my debts at the dogtrack."" ""Sure, the initial rush of getting my big break is exhilarating,"" Lennox said, ""but this is only the beginning. I bring a lot more to the table than just a great vagina. I'm bursting with energy and willing to do whatever it takes to make it. So get ready, Tinseltown: I'm gonna spread my wings and show the whole world just what Sierra Nicole Lennox is all about.""","entertainment, movies, pornography, news, vol 35 issue 11, entertainment"

3798,"Bottom Of Barrel Dangerously Overscraped, Experts Warn","WASHINGTON, DC'The bottom of the collective national barrel, already badly strained from massive content depletion in recent years, is now in ""severe danger"" as a result of unchecked, unregulated overscraping, a report from the House Subcommittee on Barrel Affairs revealed Monday. ""Because of the nation's dwindling cultural output, the bottom of the barrel has been scraped beyond recognition,"" Barrel Affairs chairman Rep. Bernard Cooper (R-PA) told reporters at a Washington press conference. ""If immediate steps are not taken to federally protect what little of the barrel's lowermost layer remains, the bottom could fall out completely by as early as spring 2001."" Though federal barrel-watchers have long called for the adoption of broad-based barrel-bottom-conservation policies, their initiatives have been consistently defeated in Congress. The defeats, experts say, have largely been the result of the enormous pressure exerted by lobbyists representing America's film, television and publishing industries, whose relentless lowering of cultural standards over the last two decades has necessitated substantial increases in commercial bottom-scraping to keep up with consumer demand. ""All across America,"" Cooper said, ""the agonizing metallic groan of the bottom of the barrel, straining under severe, unrelenting structural fatigue, can be heard with ever-greater clarity. We must heed its clarion call."" The history of the conflict between barrel-conservationists and pop-cultural manufacturers has been a long and bitter one. In 1994, after a protracted legal battle with the Barrel Protection Agency, the recording industry won expanded bottom-scraping rights, resulting in such platinum-selling releases as The Eagles' Hell Freezes Over reunion CD and The Best Of Shaquille O'Neal. Brisk mail-order sales of Pure Moods, featuring such timeless, soothing melodies as ""The X-Files Theme"" by DJ Dado, only exacerbated the problem. In 1996, deregulation of many previously protected sections of the barrel's lowermost surface area resulted in the prime-time-TV premieres of Nick Freno, Alright Already and The Brian Benben Show, among many others. However, the subcommittee report notes, it was not until the Walt Disney Corporation began unprecedented, wholesale strip-mining of the bottom of the barrel to generate such recent big-screen retreads as Mr. Magoo, George Of The Jungle and Flubber that emergency levels were reached. The situation worsened in October 1998, when Disney lawyers successfully sidestepped several key BPA safeguards and won the right to use actual splinters from the bottom of the barrel to construct the current theatrical release My Favorite Martian, causing scientists monitoring the barrel's eroding structural integrity to declare that a ""crisis state"" had been reached. ""Something must be done,"" said Cooper, issuing a stern warning to the nation's $240 billion barrel-scraping industry. ""Without effective, proactive strategies to reduce barrel-scraping now, the national barrel'the very repository of our nation's socio-cultural substance'may not survive the imminent release of The Mod Squad movie."" The report has sparked strong reaction on Capitol Hill, including numerous calls for tougher bottom-of-the-barrel protective legislation and greater restrictions on privatized barrel-scraping. But many observers regard such efforts as too little too late, pointing out that signs of an imminent barrel-bottom collapse can already be seen in nearly every aspect of American social and cultural life. ""I hate this,"" said Scottsdale, AZ, housewife Sandy Evans, 48, sitting down to yet another game of Balderdash! with family members and dinner guests. ""It'd be nice to do something different, like maybe relate to each other as human beings or something, but, no, it's either Balderdash! again or that dreadful Boomer Edition of Trivial Pursuit for the 17 billionth time."" ""Our store's copy of National Lampoon's Senior Trip, generally regarded by industry insiders as pretty much the last commercially available videotape anyone would ever want to see, has already been rented more than 850 times,"" said Larry Freberg, co-owner of Video Villa in Omro, WI. ""People are desperate. They've already seen everything else, including WWF Presents: The Best Of Junkyard Dog, Sleepover Massacre VIII: The Bludgeoning and Footloose: The Musical: The Video. They've literally got nowhere to turn."" According to the new report, such examples, while alarming, are far from unusual. Currently, the report found, there are more than 30 Chicken Soup For The Soul books in print, ranging from Chicken Soup For The Golfer's Soul to Chicken Soup For The Model-Railroad Hobbyist's Soul to Chicken Soup For The Orchid-Show Attendee's Soul. Even more shocking, an additional 22 installments of the series, including Chicken Soup For That Weird Guy You Always See On The Bus' Soul and Chicken Soup For The Husk-Like Shell Of A Person Who Doesn't Even Have A Soul Anymore's Soul, are in the works. The software company X-Treme Interactive, also cited in the report, recently released MechWar Apocalypse 3: City Of Deathazoids, the 893rd robots-blowing-each-other-up game to hit the market, as well as Poison Fist V, the 1,297th ninjas-kicking-each-other-in-the-face game, prompting the suicide of one of the company's senior programmers.

3801,I Have Newfound Respect For Yasmine Bleeth After Reading This Month's Maxim,"Though I've long been familiar with actress Yasmine Bleeth from her work on Baywatch, I've never been lucky enough to catch one of her rare talk-show appearances. That's why I was so thrilled when I passed a newsstand and happened to notice her on the cover of this month's Maxim magazine. Eager to learn more about what makes this up-and-coming young actress tick, I purchased the issue. It was the best decision I've made in quite some time. Maxim has always impressed me with its in-depth coverage of leading Hollywood personalities. Sure, it offers indispensable advice on how to get one's abs rock hard and what cool gear to buy, but it's the engaging profiles of entertainment-industry figures that keep me coming back for more. Where else can I learn how Carmen Electra feels about joining the cast of Hyperion Bay? Or how Voyager star Jeri Ryan manages to squeeze into that form-fitting costume? Or how Jenny McCarthy is coping with the cancellation of her sitcom? From the moment I picked up this month's Maxim, I could tell the Yasmine Bleeth story was going to be every bit as illuminating as those other terrific profiles. I knew it wouldn't be long before I finally discovered what it is about Bleeth that millions of Americans find so compelling. And boy, did I ever! It turns out Bleeth, who was voted one of People's 50 Most Beautiful People of 1995, credits her success to never giving up. (Who knew?) And by approaching life like it's a big adventure, Bleeth has been able to continue making a splash after walking away from a hugely successful stint on Baywatch, keeping busy with TV appearances, music videos, CD-ROMs, and even her own poster. The in-depth article, accompanied by six or seven full-page photos thrown in here and there, also explained that Yasmine loved working with David Hasselhoff and considers him a real professional. It went on to note that Yasmine, who somehow finds time for modeling on the side, is a real professional herself, having been in front of the camera since she was six months old, getting her start in commercials. I had no idea! I also had no idea that this buoyant brunette has appeared in several recent made-for-TV movies, including one co-starring Jennie Garth that dealt with the serious issue of stalking. Or that she has done guest spots on programs ranging from Veronica's Closet to Boy Meets World. Or that she loves sports and keeps active with everything from beach volleyball to horseback riding. Or that she recently overcame heartbreak. Fortunately, though, Maxim was there to clue me in. It's so nice to see a men's magazine chronicle the unique talents of a fresh-faced young actress and publish pictures of her. It doesn't happen every day, but when it does, it's a real joy. Inspired by this article, I now plan to seek out more information about Ms. Bleeth. Perhaps another magazine, such as Details or Loaded, has profiled her at some point. Or perhaps someone has thought to create a website that offers insightful commentary on her work. Whatever the case, it's clear to me that, as Maxim so aptly put it, I am now one of the millions of Americans who's got Yasmania.","opinion, entertainment, celebrities, magazines, commentary, vol 35 issue 08, pete d'alessio, entertainment"

3807,New Sony In-Utero TV To Entertain Children In The Womb,"LOS ANGELES'The entertainment industry is abuzz following the Sony Corporation's unveiling Monday of the Utertron 9000, a state-of-the-art in-utero womb-entertainment system for children between the ages of minus nine months and zero. The Utertron 9000, touted as the first prenatelevision technology ever developed, features micro-miniature multi-speaker SurrounSound, HDTV compatibility and a luxurious one and one-sixteenth-inch screen. It will make its official debut Feb. 15 at the World OB/GYN Electronics Expo in Las Vegas, and is slated to hit stores nationwide by early fall. ""Thanks to the revolutionary new Utertron 9000,"" Sony vice-president of media relations Grant Bellows told reporters, ""developing fetuses everywhere will soon be able to enjoy the same high-quality entertainment programming that, until now, has only been available to the post-born."" According to manufacturers, when inserted into the vaginal opening of an expectant mother and activated using a special belt-mounted power-pack, the Utertron 9000 bonds biochemically to the uterine wall, providing the developing fetus with a much-needed entertainment outlet during its months of isolation in the womb. ""Sitting around for all those months with nothing to do, just waiting to be born, can get pretty boring,"" said expectant mother Therese Doumanian, who has ordered a Utertron 9000 for her unborn child. ""I sure wish I had one of those when I was developing."" ""I want my child to have all the best in life,"" said a pregnant Helen Kemmerling of Topeka, KS. ""Why should my baby have to wait until passing through the birth canal before getting the little extras that make life special?"" With more than 4.1 million children conceived in 1998, the under-zero set is one of the fastest-growing demographics in the U.S. And as the first product to tap into the viewership potential of this group, the Utertron 9000 is expected to have a major impact on advertisers eager to tap into the vast gestation-based market. ""The younger you can reach people with your product, the better,"" said Procter & Gamble vice-president of marketing John Loesser, whose company will soon launch Crest For Embryos, a new tartar-control toothpaste that protects and whitens the tiny calcium deposits that eventually become teeth. ""The idea is to foster brand-loyalty among consumers right from the start, and what better place to do so than in the womb?"" In an effort to attract unborn viewers, the major networks, working in conjunction with top obstetricians, are developing programming that specifically caters to them. Already in production are the NBC family drama Mother's Voice and the X-Files-style paranormal drama What Lies Beyond The Opening?, as well as the made-for-TV movie Umbilicus, starring digitally neotenized versions of Ted Danson and Jimmy Smits. Also in the works is an MTV spin-off that will offer a 24-hour rotation of music videos accompanied by gently throbbing reddish lights and heartbeat rhythms. Fetuses will have the additional option of watching pay-per-view movies, which they can select by reflexively kicking at a special controller. Advertising rates will be determined by Amnio-Nielsens drawn from a random sampling of amniotic sacs four times a year. Despite all the excitement, the creation of programming for the fetal market was not without its difficulties. ""One of the challenges we faced in reaching these youngest of viewers was their limited capacity for sensory perception,"" said Sony director of product development Derrick Kagemoto, ""particularly those whose eyes and ears haven't fully formed yet."" To address this problem, Kagemoto said Sony and the networks have created programming specially tailored for each trimester of pregnancy, custom-made to appeal to the fetal viewer's changing physical needs at each stage of its biological formation. ""Now, even the most primitive globule of undifferentiated cells will be able to subdivide while enjoying the very latest in hot home-entertainment hits'albeit in a highly abstract, preverbal form,"" Kagemoto said. ""Sony's amazing technology is developing even faster than our target market's digestive systems."" In addition to the boon it represents to marketers, the Utertron 9000 offers a host of health benefits to its users. Sony doctors are recommending the product to all expectant couples as an effective ""head start"" to help stimulate the fetal brain. ""In a recent Sony study of pregnant women,"" Sony consulting therapist Dr. Eli Wasserbaum said, ""mothers implanted with the Utertron 9000 reported significantly less agitation and kicking on the part of their unborn children, who were happily engaged with stimulating, enriching TV fare."" Further, Wasserbaum said, test fetuses with access to a Utertron 9000 were born more docile and cooperative, and less emotionally needy, than those who came to term without one. ""My first three children always wanted to be held,"" Wilkes-Barre, PA, mother Meredith Schraeger said. ""Little Jared, though, just watches his Utertron all day and night. Even now, two months out of the womb, he can't seem to bear to part with it. It's almost as if the TV has imprinted itself on his brain as his sole source of mental and emotional nourishment, and he's incapable of any sustained human contact. And I don't have to tell you the kind of hassles that saves a busy parent like me.""","entertainment, science & technology, products, tv, television, pregnancy, electronics, news, vol 35 issue 03, entertainment"

3815,"No, You're Thinking Of David Doyle","Look, I'm only going to say this one more time. I did not play Bosley on Charlie's Angels. The character's name was Bosley, but he was played by David Doyle. Got it? Doyle. D-O-Y-L-E. As long as we're on the subject, I also didn't play Ted Atwater on The New Dick Van Dyke Show, Francis Macklin on Sweet Surrender or Bridget's father Walter on Bridget Loves Bernie. All of these were played by'yes, you guessed it'David Goddamn Doyle. You'd think that after almost 40 years in this business, people would have the decency to stop mixing me up with every half-wit with a SAG card. I mean, it's not like I haven't had a successful career. Father Dowling Mysteries. Wait Till Your Father Gets Home. That Was The Week That Was. Oh, and a little show called Happy Days. Perhaps you've heard of it. You know, Fonzie, Ralph Malph and Howard Cunningham? It was only the most popular program of the '70s. How long was Charlie's Angels on the air, three years? Tell me, how many of the big guns, the true show-business giants, has your precious David Doyle worked with? Wow, Farrah Fawcett-Majors and Meredith Baxter-Birney. Talk about your 5,000-megawatt star power. Tell me, was it Doyle who downed martinis with Dino on his hit variety show? No. Was it Doyle who co-starred with the spunky Sandy Duncan and the always-glamorous Debbie Reynolds on their popular sitcoms? Methinks not. And I don't recall Doyle ever guesting on Murder, She Wrote, much less playing Sheriff Amos Tupper for four highly rated seasons. No, my friends, that was I, Tom Fucking-A Bosley. Of course, I mean no disrespect to the late Mr. Doyle. He was a man of great talent. After all, no one could touch his Grandpa Pickles on Rugrats, especially not that charisma-free hack voicing him in the movie version. But just between you and me, let's face it: Doyle couldn't have pulled off Belle's father in the Broadway smash-hit Beauty And The Beast, or Ben Franklin in John Jakes' acclaimed mini-series The Bastard. And just imagine a world in which Doyle was the Glad trash bags' spokesman for over a decade. That is not the kind of world in which I would ever want to live. Oh, and speaking of commercials, I wasn't the Maytag repairman either, you dingbats. That was Jesse White, until he died. Now it's Gordon Jump, Mr. Carlson from WKRP In Cincinnati. Which reminds me. I didn't play Mr. Carlson on WKRP, either. Or Tom Bradford on Eight Is Enough, or Doc Bricker on The Love Boat. Not even Chief Carl Kanisky on Gimme A Break. Idiots.

3836,Blues Singer's Woman Permitted To Tell Her Side,"CLARKSDALE, MS'Ida Mae Dobbs, longtime woman of Willie ""Skipbone"" Jackson, called a press conference Tuesday to respond to charges levied against her by the legendary Delta blues singer. ""Despite what Mr. Jackson would have you believe, I am not an evil-hearted woman who will not let him be,"" Dobbs told reporters. ""I repeat: I am not an evil-hearted woman who will not let him be. To the contrary, my lovin' is so sweet, it tastes just like the apple off the tree."" Dobbs, accused of causing Jackson pain and breaking his heart by calling out another man's name, categorically denied treating him in a low-down manner. ""He says he sends for his baby, but I don't come around,"" Dobbs, a brownskin woman, said. ""He says he sends for his baby, but I don't come around. Well, the truth is, I do come, but he is out messing with every gal in town."" During the press conference, Dobbs also disputed an Aug. 27 statement made by Jackson, who compared her to a dresser because someone is always going through her drawers. ""My drawers have not been gone through by any man but Willie ""Skipbone"" Jackson,"" Dobbs said. ""Neither Slim McGee nor Melvin Brown has ever been in my drawers. Nor has Sonny 'Spoonthumb' Perkins, nor any of those other no-good jokers down by the railroad tracks. My policy has always been to keep my drawers closed to everyone but Mr. Jackson, as I am his woman and would never treat him so unkind."" In addition to denying Jackson's drawer-opening allegations, Dobbs disputed charges of unrestricted sweet-potato-pie distribution, insisting that her pie is available only to Jackson. ""I do not give out my sweet potato pie arbitrarily, as I am not the sort of no-good doney who engages in such objectionable behavior,"" Dobbs told reporters. ""Only one man can taste my sweet potato pie, and I believe I have made it perfectly clear who that man is."" Dobbs noted that the same policy applies to her biscuits, which may be buttered only by Jackson. While most of the accusations levied against Dobbs relate to her running around town with other men, she does face one far more serious charge, attempted homicide. On May 5, 1998, Jackson was rushed to the hospital and narrowly escaped death after ingesting nearly five ounces of gasoline. Jackson claimed that Dobbs tried to murder him, serving him a glass of the toxic fuel when he requested water. Dobbs dismissed the episode as ""an accident."" Dobbs, a short-dress, big-legged woman from Coahoma County, said it is not she but Jackson who should be forced to defend himself. According to Dobbs, Jackson frequently has devilment on his mind, staying up until all hours of the night rolling dice and drinking smokestack lightning. ""Six nights out of seven, he goes off and gets his swerve on while I sit at home by myself. Then he comes knocking on my door at 4 a.m., expecting me to rock him until his back no longer has any bone,"" Dobbs said. ""Is that any way for a man to treat his woman?

Dobbs said that until she receives an apology from Jackson and a full retraction of all accusations, he will not be given any grinding. ""Mr. Jackson says that I stay out all night and that I'm not talking right. He says he has rambling on his mind as a result of my treating him so unkind. He says I want every downtown man I meet and says they shouldn't even let me on the street,"" Dobbs said. ""Well, I refuse to allow my name to be dragged through the mud like this any longer. Unless my man puts an end to these unfair attacks on my character, I will neither rock nor roll him to the break of dawn. I am through with his low-down ways.""","entertainment, music, summer music, news, vol 43 issue 19, entertainment"
3837,Oprah Viewers Patiently Awaiting Instructions,"CHICAGO, IL'With nearly three weeks having passed since talk-show host Oprah Winfrey last issued an official command, approximately 60 million Oprah Winfrey Show viewers are on standby, stationed in front of their television sets and patiently awaiting further instructions from their leader. ""We must be patient with Oprah,"" said Winfrey fan Melanie Leupke, 44, of Stillwater, OK. ""Ours is not to question why she is taking so long. When the time is right and we are needed again, Oprah will tell us what to do."" Across the U.S., Oprah viewers' anticipation for new Winfrey directives is reaching a fever pitch. In Winfrey's home base of Chicago, throngs of fans gather outside her Harpo Studios headquarters around the clock, maintaining their silent, faithful vigil. Though the city's streets are quiet, a palpable sense of expectation fills the air. ""What book should I read? What low-fat lemon-bread recipes should I use? What made-for-TV movies should I watch to give me a sense of empowerment?"" asked Pamela Kolb, a Mundelein, IL, homemaker and one of the approximately 13,000 Oprah viewers huddled outside her studio. ""In these complex times, it can be frightening to have to go three weeks without any guidance from a television personality. But we must remain true to Oprah's vision. Our duty is to stay focused and on full alert until new orders are issued."" ""Oprah will not let us down. I know this much is true,"" said fan Jamiqua Hudson, clutching a copy of the Wally Lamb best-seller I Know This Much Is True, the latest Oprah's Book Club selection and the last item Oprah fans were commanded to buy before the three-week directive drought began. ""She will not leave us to make decisions for ourselves. I have faith in her."" Winfrey, 44, ranks among the most successful individuals in entertainment history, with best-selling cookbooks, high-profile movie roles, close friendships with many of Hollywood's biggest power players, and a top-rated daytime talk show. Time magazine recently named her one of the Most Influential People Of The Century. Her greatest influence, however, is that which she holds over her army of nearly 60 million couch-bound women, who unfailingly obey her nationally televised directives on everything from home-decorating to weight-loss. ""I follow Oprah's advice to the letter,"" said viewer Cassandra Fryer of Visalia, CA. ""When she told us to help out at our kids' schools by repainting any worn-out jungle-gym equipment, I was there right away with my paint can at the ready. In fact, so many women showed up to paint the jungle gym that the resultant multi-layered sludge, made up of thousands of coats of paint, took over seven months to dry."" ""I used to wear a lot of teal, but after seeing a recent episode called 'Oprah's Wardrobe Makeovers,' the only colors I wear are muted autumn hues, such as forest green and burgundy,"" said Liz Kuharski, a Hagerstown, MD, homemaker and mother of four. ""I just wish she would issue some more commands for us to obey. If I have to wait much longer, I might find myself inadvertently following the orders of some other talk-show host."" During the past few years, Winfrey's power seems to have grown exponentially. All 18 Oprah's Book Club selections have been New York Times best-sellers. When, through the auspices of her charity organization, Oprah's Angel Network, she ordered her followers to contribute pocket change to the World's Largest Piggy Bank for scholarships for needy children, they did so in record numbers. Her May 1998 command to her followers to stop eating ham sandwiches singlehandedly bankrupted the U.S. pork industry. Spokespersons for Harpo Productions said Winfrey well understands the responsibility that comes with such extraordinary power. ""Oprah takes her role as a world leader very seriously,"" Harpo Productions director of public relations Amy Hirsch said in a press release issued from deep within the company's massive network of underground bunkers. ""Her commitment to the betterment of her subjects is supreme, and she will allow nothing and no one to stand in the way of such efforts."" ""Sometimes, I don't know what to do,"" said Jane Clement, a Cedar Rapids, IA, manicurist. ""But, then, Oprah comes on the TV and explains to me what I should be doing, and I feel better."" Clement's sentiments are typical of millions of Oprah viewers, who have total faith in their leader. But despite such faith, some experts fear that if the wait for a new edict goes on much longer, serious trouble may arise. ""The U.S. daytime-TV audience is a powderkeg waiting to go off,"" said Prof. Katherine Anne Beatts, director of Harvard University's prestigious Institute For Media Studies. ""If this mob continues to be left without direction, it is in danger of fragmenting into thousands of uncontrollable splinter groups, acting without cohesion and creating a state of virtual anarchy. Oprah must avert this crisis scenario by acting now, before it is too late."" Added Beatts: ""The paucity of leadership in this country should be deeply appalling to any civilized person.""","entertainment, television, news, vol 34 issue 06, entertainment"

3841,The Chevy Chase Show Enters Sixth Blockbuster Season In Alternate Universe,"LOS ANGELES'The Chevy Chase Show is steamrolling into its sixth blockbuster season in an alternate universe, it was reported Tuesday. According to sources, the late-night talk show, which ran for five disastrous weeks in the fall of 1993 in this universe, earned critical acclaim and a small but devoted cult following during its first season in the alternate realm. The program then steadily grew more popular through word of mouth, becoming the highest-rated talk show on TV by its third season, when Chase was proclaimed ""The King Of Late Night"" in a Time magazine cover story. The Chevy Chase Show will celebrate its five years on the air'during which it has won 11 Emmys and two Peabodys'with a star-studded two-hour prime-time special on Fox this Friday at 9 p.m. EST, immediately following The Wilton North Report. The prime-time special will feature highlights from the past five seasons, from the historic first episode featuring Oscar-winning box-office queen Goldie Hawn to President Clinton's surprise walk-on appearance last year. Clips from the show's wildly popular recurring comedy segments, including ""Ask Dr. Chase"" and ""Chevy Tries On Funny Hats,"" will also be featured, as will a montage of Chase's serenades to guests on his desk-mounted keyboard. The show's sixth season kicks off Sept. 7, with a redesigned set featuring a larger fishtank, more sound-effect buttons on Chase's desk, and a supercharged horn section for the show's band, The Hollywood Express. Chase will still do his popular ""News Update"" at the show's midpoint, 11:30 p.m. EST, the time at which The Tonight Show With Jay Leno and Late Show With David Letterman used to start before their alternate-universe cancellations in 1993. ""Our strategy of having Chevy do the news just as Dave and Jay were coming on the air worked to perfection,"" Chevy Chase Show executive producer Marty Sachs said. ""Nobody wanted to change channels, and, within a matter of weeks, The Tonight Show and Late Show were history."" For all the success, The Chevy Chase Show was nearly derailed earlier this month when Tom Scott, Chase's bandleader and second banana, held out for $2.5 million for the 1998-99 season. That salary dispute, as well as one with head writer Michael O'Donoghue, was resolved last week. In a press conference held at the Chevy Chase Theater, one of alternate-universe Los Angeles' hottest tourist landmarks, a smiling Chase told reporters: ""I want to thank the critics and the American viewing public for their extraordinary support of The Chevy Chase Show. But, as wonderful as all that has been, what I'm most happy about is just having the opportunity to work with this incredible creative team. I'm the luckiest guy in the world."" Chase then stared blankly into the television cameras while sweating and twitching nervously, the gesture that has become his much-loved trademark over the past five years. ""Chevy is a god,"" said Peter Scolari, comic actor and alternate-universe star of Forrest Gump, Apollo 13 and Saving Private Ryan. ""He's everything I aspire to be in this business.""","entertainment, tv, news, vol 34 issue 05, entertainment"

3845,E! Gives Local Masturbator Inside Scoop On This Summer's Hottest New Swimwear,"SMYRNA, GA'Gregg Reinisch, a Smyrna-area masturbator, stays on top of all the latest trends in swimwear by watching the E! cable network, it was reported Tuesday. ""When I want the inside scoop on which swimsuit styles are heating up the beaches this summer, there's only one network I turn to,"" Reinisch said of E!, whose award-winning swimwear coverage includes such programs as Fashion File: Sexy Swimsuits, Special Report: Beachwear '98 and An E! History Of The Bikini. ""E! is the only channel that offers the kind of in-depth information I crave."" According to the 26-year-old masturbator, without E! he would not know what suits to look out for on the beaches of St. Tropez and Rio de Janeiro, where less is definitely more. ""About five or six years ago, before I started watching E!, I took a trip to the south of France,"" Reinisch said. ""It was awful'there were swimsuits all around me, but I didn't have the slightest idea which ones were the hot new styles to keep an eye on. I was an uninformed beachgoer, and that's the worst kind."" Barry Booker, E! vice-president of programming, said his network strives to be the leader in the field of swimwear coverage. ""Why is our coverage the best? Because we don't just tell the viewer what changes they can expect in swimsuit styles, we show them,"" Booker said. ""For example, if pink is the hot color for bikinis this year, we make sure to actually show what a pink bikini looks like on a tight-bodied 20-year-old down on all fours in the surf. Or if, for example, floral prints are in, we make sure to show what a floral-printed bikini looks like on a tight-bodied 20-year-old down on all fours in the surf. Our viewers appreciate that."" ""There is an amazing variety of swimsuits we can lovingly pan over while a model arches her back on a rock,"" Booker said. ""From the French-cut one-piece to the Brazilian-style bikini, to the traditional G-string, there are nearly as many swimsuits as there are masturbators."" While swimsuit fashion captivates Reinisch, it is by no means his only area of interest. ""Lately, I've been reading a lot of books about Miami Dolphins cheerleading-squad calendars and how they're put together'how the photos are taken, what's going through a particular cheerleader's mind as the photos are being taken. It's really a fascinating process,"" Reinisch said. ""So you can imagine how thrilled I was to find out that E! will soon air a half-hour documentary on this very subject. Apparently, when the Dolphins cheerleaders went to Jamaica to shoot their 1999 swimsuit calendar, an E! reporter and camera crew tagged along to get the inside scoop on the whole thing. It sounds incredible. I'm masturbating just thinking about it.""","entertainment, sex, tv, trends, news, vol 34 issue 03, entertainment"
3846,Infomercial Makes Leap To Big Screen,"HOLLYWOOD, CA'A spokesperson for Paramount Pictures confirmed Tuesday that the studio will make a feature-length film version of the wildly popular ""Abdomenizer®"" television infomercial. ""Next summer, Bruce Willis is The Abdomenizer, a marked-for-death federal agent with nothing to lose but those unsightly love handles,"" Paramount vice-president of development Irwin Shuler said. ""On July 4, 1999, get ready for explosive firming and toning action."" The Abdomenizer, which begins shooting next month, will star Willis as Jack Tyler, an FBI munitions expert who struggles daily with overpriced exercise equipment that just doesn't deliver. As the twin crises of losing muscle tone and turning 40 hit Tyler, a mysterious young woman comes into his life and introduces him to the Abdomenizer® muscle-toning system. As the film builds to a thrilling climax, terrorists announce that a nuclear bomb will devastate Los Angeles unless Willis can lose 10 pounds of ugly stomach flab in 48 hours. In addition to Willis, the film will feature Gary Oldman, Lauren Holly and Kurt Russell, who appears in a supporting role as a rival munitions expert who is still using those ineffective, ""gimmicky"" spot-reducing devices. Said Shuler: ""The climactic scene, in which Willis rushes to defuse the bomb as Russell discovers just how easy and fun The Abdomenizer® is, will renew moviegoers' faith in the beauty of life and in their ability to lose unsightly inches off the tummy, hips and thighs in just 12 minutes a day."" Greg Renker, executive producer of The Abdomenizer, described the process by which the infomerical was brought to the big screen. ""I was very skeptical when [screenwriter] Jonathan Auster told me his idea for the film,"" Renker said. ""I thought, 'Come on, turn an infomercial into a movie?' It sounded too good to be true! So just imagine my delight when he came up with a fantastic screenplay'the script he wrote really works!"" The $85 million film will be accompanied by a major merchandising campaign, including a line of official The Abdomenizer Abdomenizers®. Anticipation over The Abdomenizer is so high that rival studios are already developing their own infomercial-to-film adaptations. New Line Cinema recently paid Tim Burton $22 million for his Juiceman screenplay, and Orion Pictures is in negotiations with George Foreman for a film version of The George Foreman Lean Mean Fat-Reducing Grilling Machine.","entertainment, celebrities, advertising, news, vol 34 issue 02, entertainment"

3849,Report: 32 Percent Of U.S. Citizens Still Not Famous,"WASHINGTON, DC'According to a report released Tuesday by the U.S. Census Bureau, only 32 percent of Americans are still not famous. ""Between Powerball winners, president-fellaters, 11-year-old elementary-school shooters, daytime-TV talk-show guests, and women who give birth on the Internet, a whopping 68 percent of U.S. citizens can be categorized as celebrities,"" Census Bureau director Gordon Tillinghast said. ""The 'non-famed' demographic is among the most rapidly shrinking in the U.S."" The 32 percent figure, determined by the Census Bureau's July 1998 Current Population Survey, represents a 10 percent decline in the number of non-famous Americans over the past 18 months. At the current rate of celebrity growth among the general populace, census officials estimate, 225 million U.S. citizens will be famous by 2003. ""Just about everyone I know is famous,"" said Wichita Falls, TX, resident Frederick Trotta, who rose to national prominence in 1997 when he won The Today Show's ""My Husband Has America's Funniest-Looking Beard!"" contest after his wife Carla submitted his photo to the NBC morning program. Trotta added that his wife has been famous herself since October 1986, when, as a high-school senior, a home video of her and three friends lip-synching to Madonna's ""True Blue"" was featured on an MTV ""Blue Monday""-themed video program. He also noted that two of his neighbors were profiled on Dateline NBC, as well as several other newsmagazines, after their respective UFO-abduction experiences were featured as dramatic recreations on the Sci-Fi Channel's Sightings. Census officials attribute the rise in the number of famous Americans to the ever-expanding variety of ways a person can achieve celebrity status. ""Thirty years ago, if you wanted to be famous, you pretty much had three options: become a singer, an athlete or a movie star,"" said Census Bureau deputy director Tim Evigan, brother of B.J. And The Bear star Greg Evigan and recent guest on a ""Siblings To The Stars"" episode of Sally Jessy Raphäel. ""Today, however, the number of ways one can achieve fame is staggering: You could win a contest, fall into a well, blow up a federal building, sleep with a senator and then pose nude, become paralyzed, kill a guitarist, give birth to a lot of babies at once, stalk a supermodel'the possibilities are endless."" So why are so few Americans opting for the traditional, old-fashioned, non-famous lifestyle? According to newly anointed celebrity and MTV ""I Wanna Be A VJ"" contest-winner Jesse Camp, the answer lies in Americans' fascination not merely with the famous, but with fame itself. ""Becoming famous is the ultimate dream for millions of Americans raised in our culture of celebrity worship, even for those who, like myself, don't really have an actual reason to be famous,"" Camp said. ""Fame isn't the exclusive domain of those with a particular talent like it used to be. As my own meteoric rise to national prominence attests, fame is now well within the reach of even the least interesting."" Added Camp, ""This is a great time to be famous."" With most industry leaders forecasting a 750-channel television landscape in the next 10 years, the number of non-famous Americans is likely to drop substantially. ""We're going to have to find something to fill all that new airtime,"" said Viacom vice-president of programming John Garrick, currently overseeing development of 35 new programs, including Those Amazing Septuplets!, The Heidi Fleiss Show and Unedited Footage Of Pedestrians Walking. ""We just inked a deal for Mary Kay LeTourneau and Jessica Hahn to host their own talk shows, even though most people can't even remember how they became celebrities in the first place. Being famous has never been easier."" Douglas Bloomer, a Galveston, TX, data-entry supervisor who achieved celebrity by riding a roller coaster for five days to win a new Volkswagen Beetle, also expects the number of famous people to rise. ""If I'm famous, then just about anybody can be,"" he said. ""I just want to say to all my fans out there who want to be celebrities and are jealous of those of us who are, don't worry: You will be any day now."" Lynette Herlihy, executive producer of cable channel FX's upcoming The Soy Bomb Guy Variety Hour, agreed. ""To those of you out there who have yet to join the ranks of stardom, hang in there; your time is coming. Just remember: One potato chip in the shape of Mother Teresa is all it takes.""","entertainment, celebrities, trends, news, vol 34 issue 02, entertainment"

3864,C-SPAN Ratings Up Following Addition Of 'The House Of Representatives Dancers',"WASHINGTON, DC'C-SPAN viewership rose an impressive 21 percent during the latest Nielsen ratings period, an increase C-SPAN executives are attributing to the cable channel's recent addition of The House Of Representatives Dancers. The dancers, an ethnically diverse sextet of young women who launch into high-energy hip-hop dance routines during lulls in congressional sessions, made their debut April 25 and have quickly become one of C-SPAN's most popular features. ""I used to switch channels during those long, boring House votes and filibuster speeches,"" Norwalk, CT, C-SPAN viewer Randolph Groelke said. ""But now those are my favorite parts."" Said C-SPAN president Edward Rumsfeld: ""We are deeply indebted to Kim, Randi, Dayna and all the other Fly Honeys on the H. of R. Dancer Krew for expanding our viewer base and introducing a broader demographic to the exciting world of federal legislation."" Special commendation was also awarded to DJ Funkmaster G, for ""throwing down the beats which are sufficiently phat to accompany our nation's elected officials. Thanks to his tireless efforts on the turntables, the House Of Representatives is representin' coast-to-coast and worldwide."" To accommodate the newest stars of C-SPAN's daily broadcasts, the House chamber was widened considerably in April to add a light-up dance floor and a wall of video screens to the right of the Speaker's chair. A graffiti-strewn brick wall has been installed behind the speaker's podium to give the chamber a ""street-scene"" ambiance. Next week's schedule on C-SPAN calls for debate on a possible revision to current AFDC law, voting on a controversial Florida Wetlands preservation bill, and ""Gonna Make You Sweat"" by C+C Music Factory. The dancers are the first major addition to C-SPAN since the May 1997 introduction of ""Mr. Slotnik,"" Congress' cantankerous landlord.

Employing a six-girl coalition to overthrow the panel of celebrity judges, Kenner firmly established herself as the supreme power in Teen USA. ""I am the prettiest,"" she said, declaring herself Miss Teen USA For Life. ""I am also the sweetest."" Resplendent in a shimmering white evening gown and bedecked with the coveted Miss Teen USA tiara, Kenner tearfully waved and smiled at onlookers as she clutched a bouquet of roses, flanked by her elite, machine-gun-wielding secret police, the Revlon Guard. Mandatory audience applause was enforced with the threat of immediate execution. Kenner, who hopes to be a veterinarian one day because ""I love horses so much,"" employed brutal force in establishing her military-style junta, seizing control of Teen USA through swift, violent deployment of the Revlon Guard. The teen beauty credited her success to ""a bright smile, a positive attitude and a willingness to eliminate anyone who stands in my way."" Kenner's inner circle includes Miss Congeniality Amanda Rochlin of Connecticut and Salon Selectives' ""Teen With Style"" winner Missy Harris of Delaware. An 11th-hour attempt to reclaim power by pageant hosts Bob Goen and Shari Belafonte-Harper backfired, resulting in their on-air execution at Kenner's hands. Celebrity judges critically wounded in the purge include Home Improvement's Zachery Ty Bryan, Mary Kay Cosmetics vice-president Andrea Iwerks and Superstar Management CEO Albert Sloan. On Monday, Kenner declared martial law across Teen USA and unveiled the new constitution of her regime. ""The law will be dispensed by me, okay?"" she said. ""Everybody has to do what I say, when I say, as I see fit. Only the popular shall determine the fate of the masses."" Among the original Miss Teen USA Pageant rules she has already repealed is the one barring pageant winners from dating during their term. ""I shall date the boys I wish, when I wish,"" Kenner said. ""But I will not go to bed with them. I am saving myself for the man I marry, because sex is more special when you wait."" Though no formal diplomatic relations have been established between the Teen USA government and that of the U.S., White House officials have expressed a willingness to open a line of dialogue with the newly formed republic. When asked what she would say if she could talk to President Clinton about one issue, Kenner said, ""I would ask him to put more money into saving the environment, because, when you think about it, this is the only planet we've got, and we need to make it a better place for our children to grow up in."" Added Kenner: ""All enemies of the state will be crushed."" Kenner intends to use her $150,000 in cash and prizes to ""consolidate Teen USA's power into an unstoppable military juggernaut."" Her favorite movie is Titanic.","entertainment, news, vol 33 issue 22, entertainment"

3875,Fox Disappointed In Low Ratings For New Sitcom Eat At Taco Bell,"LOS ANGELES'Despite their ""great disappointment"" in the show's low ratings, Fox executives announced Monday that they are standing by the four-week-old sitcom Eat At Taco Bell. The series, which focuses on the lives of seven New York City twentysomethings who meet at a neighborhood Taco Bell each day to eat and hang out, has averaged less than a three share in the Nielsen ratings since its April 3 debut. ""We really had high hopes for this sitcom, and we still do,"" said Fox vice-president of programming Jonathan Bosch. ""I'm confident that, with a little retooling and a possible time-slot change, Eat At Taco Bell will find its audience. Before long, millions of Americans will be tuning in each week to watch Lisa, Matt and the rest of the gang get into crazy adventures, talk about love and sex, and eat delicious Taco Bell food."" Bosch spoke highly of next week's episode, in which the ever-scheming Andre gets into hot water when he has dates with two different women on the same night at Taco Bell. ""All heck breaks loose when Andre has to run back and forth to opposite sides of the restaurant, struggling to keep track of the conversations he's having, and trying to eat a Double Decker Taco Supreme with one date and a Chili Cheese Burrito with the other,"" Bosch said. ""Let's just say that, by the end of the evening, Andre has had more than his fill of mischief'and delicious Taco Bell food."" Also on the horizon, Bosch said, is an episode in which Melanie pretends to be a Taco Bell employee to impress a date. ""When Melanie sneaks into the food-preparation area and tries to make a Seven-Layer Burrito untrained, it's complete pandemonium,"" Bosch said. ""And it's all because she wanted her date to think she worked in a fun atmosphere with flexible hours and competitive wages."" While Eat At Taco Bell finished a respectable 21st in the Nielsen ratings its first week, it has since slipped dramatically. Last week, it finished an abysmal 109th, beating only WB's The Parent 'Hood and CBS's Buy Sherwin-Williams Paint. In an effort to boost ratings, Eat At Taco Bell producers have scheduled numerous guest appearances for upcoming episodes, including Living Single star Queen Latifah, who will drop by the restaurant later this month to enjoy a Mexican Pizza and small drink with the gang. Other celebrities slated to appear in coming weeks include David Alan Grier, Knots Landing supervixen Donna Mills, and Star Trek's George Takei, who stirs up big trouble when he challenges Rebecca to a Tostada-eating contest. Despite the low ratings, Eat At Taco Bell advertisers are maintaining their support of the struggling program. ""We believe this is a quality show that deserves to be seen. And, as such, we will continue to demonstrate our strong faith in Eat At Taco Bell by advertising on it,"" Pepsico CEO Christopher Burwell said. ""I am confident that, given the opportunity, this bold and daring new program can revitalize the sitcom format in much the same way that Steak and Chicken Gorditas are revitalizing the old-fashioned taco.""","entertainment, tv, news, vol 33 issue 17, entertainment"

3893,I Can't Believe The TV They Make Me Watch,"I cannot believe the garbage they make me watch on TV these days. Do they think we're morons or something? Take, for example, that show Soul Man. Every week, I think it can't get any worse, and somehow, it does. In last week's episode, Tim Allen's character from Home Improvement dropped in on Reverend Mike and the gang (again) and wreaked havoc when he tried to repair the church's electrical wiring. It was so dumb, I nearly turned it off! Things weren't much better on NBC last Monday night, when four straight shows'Suddenly Susan, Caroline In The City, The Naked Truth and Fired Up'all had practically the same exact plot. Are the people who make these shows that unoriginal? I'm at the point where I can predict almost every line Caroline is going to say to Richard. And, with all the repeats they run, by the second or third time around, I can almost recite an episode's whole darn script! Who needs that? Then there was that week-long Harper Valley PTA marathon on TNT. I could barely get through it. I mean, it's rough enough having to watch one episode of that lousy show, but 30? Come on! It's gotten so bad of late, I've had to upgrade from basic to expanded cable. I figured that with expanded cable, I'd finally get something to watch that wasn't just a big waste of time. But was I ever wrong! Now, I get 65 channels, and each one is even more idiotic than the last. From Encore to Court TV to Animal Planet to HBO, I've watched enough hours of every single one to definitively conclude that they're all worthless. And for this, I have to pay $52.35 a month! I stayed up until 4 a.m. yesterday, and it was the same darn junk all night long. I eventually got so fed up with all the Cheers reruns, psychic-hotline infomercials and World War II documentaries, I grabbed the remote control and shouted, 'No more! I can't take another minute of this!' and turned on The Learning Channel instead. But it was no use: Those same old UFO pseudo-documentaries were on, and they were as insufferable as ever. And, as if the shows aren't bad enough, you also have to sit through all those commercials. Last night, I was watching TV Censored Bloopers '98, and I counted 46 commercials during that one show alone! Isn't that the saddest thing you've ever heard? I've decided I can't take all this terrible TV anymore, so I'm going to stay home from work next week to write letters to the networks. I'll tell them what I've been saying ever since I got through watching all six seasons of that stupid show Gimme A Break'that television is worthless. My first letter will concern this new Tom Selleck show The Closer, which is the stupidest show on all of television, much less the shows on CBS I set my VCR for on Monday nights. I simply cannot understand why anyone would want to watch it, especially episodes like the one in which Alex tries to kick-start her dad's romantic life by setting him up with her snowboarding coach, and it turns out that'well, I won't ruin the ending in case you haven't seen it yet.","opinion, entertainment, television, commentary, vol 33 issue 10, bud dalrymple, entertainment"
3894,Evel Knievel To Attempt Huge Leap In Logic,"LAS VEGAS'Legendary daredevil Evel Knievel, who has long been famous for performing thrilling, death-defying stunts, will bravely defy common sense at Caesar's Palace Saturday. In a bold, never-before-attempted leap of logic, Knievel will attempt to convince a panel of renowned math experts that there exists a single largest integer to which no more can be added. At noon, with an expected crowd of 25,000 in attendance and millions more watching at home on Fox, a helmeted, jumpsuited Knievel will begin a syllogistic process of gaining larger and larger concessions from the panel of mathematicians, hoping to prove there exists a number x for which there is no possible x+1. If a majority of the 12-member panel agrees with Knievel's reasoning, the leap will be declared successful. Despite Knievel's history of overcoming impossible odds, many panel members view the jump as reckless and ill-advised. ""With all due respect to Mr. Knievel, he is mad to attempt this,"" said Quentin Collins, a professor of applied mathematics at Yale University. ""I almost declined to serve on the panel in protest of this utterly ill-conceived dance of cerebral mayhem. But I expect Knievel will learn a lesson he will never forget when his fallacious reasoning is sliced to ribbons."" ""I worry every time he does this that he'll make a mistake and get hurt,"" said Robbie Knievel, son of the famous daredevil. ""But this is what he wants to do, and I support him."" Safety precautions planned by Knievel for the leap include comprehensive, indexed copies of the writings of Plato; an intellectual ""pit crew"" of 10 world-class logicians and rhetoricians; and strategically placed fire extinguishers, in case the attempt goes awry. ""My mother always wanted me to get a normal job,"" Knievel said. ""But I gotta do what I gotta do. I believe that this leap of the imagination is possible, and I intend to prove it."" Knievel stressed that kids should not attempt to imitate the stunt, and that it's ""cool"" to wear a bike helmet. Knievel, who has broken nearly every bone in his body, gave up physical stunts several years ago and has since turned to more conceptual feats. In November 1995, he thrilled the world with a spectacular triple-leap-of-faith, in which he simultaneously joined the Unification Church of Sun Myung Moon, the Church of Scientology, and Jehovah's Witnesses, accepting in rapid succession the controversial beliefs of all three religions. A month later, trapped in three contradictory philosophies, Knievel wrestled with existential doubt and rejected all three movements, staging a spectacular fall from grace seen by millions on pay-per-view television. Knievel's recent career has not been without its setbacks. On April 15, 1997, at the Tropicana Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, Knievel plunged headlong into a morass of complicated tax forms only to be trapped without the necessary personal financial information to complete them. Emergency accountants intervened, pulling Knievel from the paperwork and completing the tax forms themselves before rushing him to an area hospital. If successful Saturday, Knievel next plans to visit a Club Med resort in Ixtapa, Mexico, where he will attempt a daring escape from the dreary nine-to-five workaday world.","entertainment, celebrities, news, vol 33 issue 08, entertainment"
3895,"Channel 6's Suzy Pratt Has Today's Forecast, Debilitating Bouts Of Depression","NORFOLK, VA'While it's hard to know exactly what Mother Nature has in store for us most of the time, television viewers in the greater Norfolk area can count on one thing: The forecast will always be sunny coming from Channel 6 meteorologist Suzy Pratt. A fixture on the local CBS affiliate's 6 p.m. news for the past eight years, Pratt, 37, is mired in a years-long battle with depression, her crumbling dignity, extreme self-loathing and unfulfilling home life steadily eroding her will to live as she becomes increasingly addicted to painkillers. ""Keep it tuned to Channel 6 for the latest weather information,"" says Pratt, summoning all her strength to hold back the tears. ""Rain or shine, Channel 6 has got you covered."" Dinner time is always fun for Channel 6 viewers when Pratt is on the set, her cheery voice and snappy outfits sure to brighten things up when the weather forecast rolls around on weekdays at 6:18 p.m. Pratt, however, usually eats a Budget Gourmet dinner around 8 p.m., standing alone at her kitchen counter, her husband Bill too absorbed in his law practice to pay any attention to his home or spouse. Though unhappy in her loveless marriage, Pratt lacks the self-esteem to get out, blaming the marital woes on what she calls her ""fading looks."" During her years on the air in Norfolk, Pratt has developed into a genuine local celebrity, pleasing her many fans with her fun weather reports, engaging human-interest stories, and the occasional public appearance at a county fair or beauty pageant. ""El Niño's stirred up a whole mess of trouble throughout the Mid-Atlantic region, and Norfolk's certainly no exception. Look for lots more heavy rain tomorrow and through the weekend,"" says Pratt, choking back sobs she desperately hopes the home audience won't detect. Once an aspiring model/actress, Pratt learned the cold, cruel ropes of the business during a grueling year in Los Angeles, bouncing from one unsuccessful audition to another and, ultimately, into bed with a ""producer"" from whom she never heard again. Pratt now views life as something to be endured, consumed by what might have been, if only she had had just a little bit more foresight and wisdom. Norfolk residents might not always like the weather they get, but everyone loves the mile-wide smile and playful giggle they get from Pratt whenever news anchor Morton Caswell fires off another of his patented ""groaners."" Wearing a wig to hide the bald spots from the patches of hair she's pulled out, Pratt masks her pain on-camera with a big smile, each televised appearance a reinforcement of the perky, cheerful weathergirl archetype she has grown both to loathe and epitomize in her years at Channel 6. Whether it's ""stormy"" or ""warmy"" outside, the good folks of Norfolk know that with Pratt and the Channel 6 AccuTron WeatherAlert system on their side, they'll always be prepared for whatever Mother Nature sends their way. Pratt, meanwhile, grows increasingly delusional, convinced that a man in a maroon turtleneck is trying to kill her. Whether her crippling paranoia will result in an on-air breakdown, an unceremonious firing from Channel 6, or hospitalization is anyone's guess, but in the meantime, everybody is enjoying having Pratt as part of their day. As for her success as one of Norfolk's best-known faces, Pratt can only say, ""I value my job at Channel 6,"" before scurrying into her car and driving off.","entertainment, health, tv, weather, news, vol 33 issue 08, entertainment"

3903,Nation's Rappers Down To Last Two Samples,"LOS ANGELES'In an announcement that has caused grave concern within the nation's hip-hop community, the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP) revealed Monday that only two songs remain for rappers to sample, Tiny Tim's ""Tiptoe Through The Tulips"" and Styx's ""Mr. Roboto."" ""Such albums as Puff Daddy's No Way Out and Mase's Harlem World have taken a heavy toll on our nation's precious sample reserves, ASCAP president Richard Goffin said. ""Our nation's rap artists must now face the consequences of their failure to conserve this all-too-finite resource."" With such artists as Puff Daddy, Jay-Z, Foxy Brown, Snoop Doggy Dogg, and Method Man all slated to begin work on new albums in the next six months, bidding for the sample rights to ""Tiptoe Through The Tulips"" and ""Mr. Roboto"" is expected to be fierce. Puff Daddy, a.k.a. Sean ""Puffy"" Combs, has already stated that he is willing to pay up to $20 million for the rights to the ukulele line in ""Tiptoe"" alone. ""Yo, I got to get that 'Tiptoe' track,"" Combs said in an interview in The Source magazine. ""I ain't got an album without it."" Styx spokespersons said the band will attempt to maximize profits from ""Mr. Roboto"" by selling off the hit song from 1983's Kilroy Was Here piecemeal. ""Our asking price for the song's 'Domo Arigato' spoken-word intro with synthesizer backing is $25 million,"" Styx bassist Chuck Panozzo said. ""As far as the lyric, 'My blood is boiling, my heart is human, my brain IBM,' goes, I can't imagine we would be asking any less than $55 million for that."" While Monday's ASCAP announcement stunned rappers across the U.S., signs of the impending crisis were present years ago. In 1989, James Brown became the first sample source to be exhausted, when the Jungle Brothers used a snippet of Brown sneezing during an outtake for ""The Big Payback"" on its album Done By The Forces Of Nature. By 1992, the music of numerous other high-profile artists was exhausted, including George Clinton, Rick James, Kool & The Gang, Prince and Queen. By 1995, nearly 80 percent of ASCAP-registered artists were tapped out as sample sources, including Roxette, Peaches & Herb, Bruce Hornsby, White Lion and Jon Secada. Last Friday, the number of unsampled songs fell to two when rapper Master P paid $12 million for the rights to ""Is It Love,"" the B-side to the 1986 Mr. Mister hit ""Broken Wings."" ""This is an extremely serious situation,"" said Def Jam president Russell Simmons, whose label'which has featured such artists as Public Enemy, Beastie Boys, EPMD, and LL Cool J'was responsible for much of the sample depletion of the mid- to late '80s. ""Rappers may have to wait upwards of 10 years between albums, until there's enough new pop songs to sample. Other than that, the only solution is for rappers to come up with the music themselves. Let's just hope it never comes to that.""","entertainment, music, summer music, news, vol 33 issue 06, entertainment"

3906,I Like All Types Of Music,"When I go to the mall for music, you won't catch me stuck in just one section of Record Town. That's because I like all kinds of music! Just yesterday, I was in the car with a girlfriend, and she asked me what kind of music she should play, so I told her that anything at all was just fine with me. After all, I like everything from Billy Joel to Elton John to Jewel. But that's not all by a long shot: One day I'll be in the mood for rock and roll, so I'll put on the new Fleetwood Mac album, and the next I'll feel like classical, so I'll reach for the Titanic soundtrack. I even listen to jazz, like that hunk Kenny G. I've also really been getting into that new ""alternative"" music after hearing it on Melrose Place and in that Volkswagen commercial. There's this one alternative song I heard last time I was eating at Denny's, and I just fell in love with it. I don't know who it's by, but it goes, ""What if God was one of us?"" It was so deep. On a typical day at home, I might listen to a Celine Dion CD, then watch a few videos on VH1, and then turn the channel to line-dancing on the Nashville Network while I do the dishes. You see, I have what is called an eclectic personality. My husband isn't half the music lover I am, so when I bought a new oak cabinet for our stereo last year, he complained that I was throwing our money away. It was kind of expensive, but I just had to have a cabinet that matched the furniture in our day room. One of my matching oak CD towers is almost half full, and I'll be getting six more CDs in the mail because I just joined the BMG Music Club. When I was filling out the enrollment form, I had a pretty hard time deciding which box to check to indicate my favorite type of music. I went ahead and checked the section that had Sheryl Crow in it, because I really like that one song she does. I like music so much that when I'm at work at the insurance agency, I keep the radio on all day. Unfortunately, last week, my love of music resulted in a very unpleasant run-in with a typist from the temp agency. Personally, I can't imagine how my music could have possibly bothered her, as we have an office rule that the volume dial goes no higher than three. It was Thursday afternoon, and I was listening to the Christian Contemporary station when the temp started making wisecracks about the music. I changed the station to Lite 107-FM, but then she began to groan loudly at the start of every song. The last straw came when she shouted ""Oh, God!"" when The Carpenters' ""Close To You"" came on. I finally just turned the darn radio off altogether. One thing I can't understand is someone who hates music.","opinion, entertainment, commentary, vol 33 issue 05, michelle carney, entertainment"

3909,'85 Chicago Bears Return To Studio:,"CHICAGO'In an announcement that has electrified the music world, the Chicago Bears Shufflin' Crew confirmed Monday that it is reuniting and will soon begin work on its first new material since the seminal 1985 ""Super Bowl Shuffle"" single. Confirming the recent swirl of music-industry rumors regarding a possible reunion, Shufflin' Crew lead singer Willie Gault told reporters: ""After nearly 12 years of solo gigs and side projects, we decided it was time for us to work together again."" Gault went on to strongly deny rumors that the Crew was returning to the studio looking for trouble. ""We didn't come here looking for trouble,"" Gault said. ""We just came to record the long-awaited follow-up to the 'Super Bowl Shuffle.'"" According to Shufflin' Crew member William ""Refrigerator"" Perry, he, Gault and punky QB Jim McMahon have already sketched out rough demo versions of 10 to 15 songs, which will, over the next two months, be fleshed out in the studio with producer Steve Albini. Perry said fans should expect the new album to be ""darker and more introspective"" than the group's ""Shuffle""-era work. ""[The new album] will definitely reflect our maturation as a group and as individuals,"" said Perry, who may be large but is no dumb cookie. ""Back then, we were young, wild and arrogant: Jim [McMahon] had his spiked hair, shades and controversial, message-bearing headbands, and I had my legendary eating exploits and rushing touchdowns. We kind of had this attitude like, 'We're so bad, we know we're good, blowing your mind like we knew we would.' But while the new record will still have that trademark Shufflin' Crew swagger, it will also show our more reflective side."" All of the original Shufflin' Crew members are expected to participate in the reunion except Otis Wilson, who told Spin magazine in a recent interview that his ""heart just isn't in it anymore."" ""Back when the group first started, we were just struttin' for fun,"" Wilson said. ""But once we hit it big, everything changed. Suddenly, there were business meetings, publicity appearances, video shoots, sponsorship deals. Before long, it wasn't about the music anymore. That's when I knew I had to get out."" Numerous names have circulated as possible Wilson replacements, ranging from former Poco bassist Jim Messina to former Bengals running back Ickey Woods. ""Otis has made his decision, and we respect that. It will be difficult, but we must go on as a band without him,"" Shufflin' Crew co-founder Walter Payton said. Added Payton: ""Running the ball is like making romance."" While the album is still months from completion, the Shufflin' Crew tried out some of the new material at an unannounced gig at Chicago's Lounge Ax music club last Friday. Response from the sold-out crowd was overwhelmingly positive. ""They sounded really good, really tight, man,"" said die-hard fan Jeff Rampling of Des Plaines, IL, who estimated he has been to over 250 Shufflin' Crew shows. ""Once they got warmed up, they were rocking like vintage '85 Crew."" ""They kicked some serious ass tonight,"" said Don Frischman, lead singer for Four-Six Defense, a Chicago-area Shufflin' Crew tribute band. ""Richard Dent still blows me away live."" In negotiating terms for the new album with Geffen Records, the Shufflin' Crew made one demand: complete creative control over the project. ""We made it clear that under no circumstances would we allow participation by the female referee who twice blew a whistle over our singers' attempts to say the word 'ass' during the 'Shuffle' sessions,"" backup vocalist Steve Fuller said. ""The Bears traffic in the truth, and either you can handle it or you can't. Censorship is slavery."" Expected to hit stores in early November, the new album will be followed by a world tour beginning February 1999. All proceeds from both the album and tour will go toward charity. ""I want to stress that we are not doing this because we're greedy,"" Payton said. ""The Bears are doing this to feed the needy."" One of the most successful American bands of the mid-'80s, the Shufflin' Crew broke up in May 1986 due to creative differences and infighting, particularly between Gault and keyboardist Gary Fencik. Gault embarked on a solo career in 1987 and scored a minor hit with the song 'Chocolate Swirl (That's What I'm As Smooth As),' but never equaled the success he had with the Shufflin' Crew. Fencik and Fuller went on to form the band Touchback with New York Giants wide receiver Phil McConkey. ""After so many years apart, it feels good to be back together again,"" Gault said. ""But most of all, I'm happy for all the Bears Shufflin' Crew fans out there. You guys are the reason we're shufflin' on down. We're doin' it for you.""","entertainment, nfl football, music, chicago bears, news, vol 33 issue 04, entertainment"

3911,Joel Siegel Preemptively Raves About Blues Brothers 2000:,"NEW YORK'Good Morning America film critic Joel Siegel, confident that he will be ""knocked out by 90 minutes of wall-to-wall, non-stop laughs,"" preemptively raved Monday about Blues Brothers 2000, due in theaters Feb. 6. ""I'm going to love it!"" said Siegel, who plans to see an advance screening of the film Saturday. ""This movie will be loaded with side-splitting humor, pulse-pounding car chases, and toe-tapping, sing-along musical numbers. I'm going to want to see it over and over!"" According to Siegel, Blues Brothers 2000, which stars Dan Aykroyd and John Goodman, will be even funnier than the original. ""Aykroyd and Goodman will be pure dynamite together,"" he said. ""I never thought I'd say this, but Blues Brothers 2000 will outshine even the first Blues Brothers movie!"" Film critic Jeff Craig of Sixty Second Preview, who plans to see the film Sunday, agreed. ""Joel is right: This movie is going to be hysterical!"" he said. Siegel said concerns that the new film would be a cheap ""cash-in"" sequel will be proven wrong by the anything-goes spirit that will imbue the entire film. Siegel said he is also looking forward to the film's slew of cameo appearances, which include Paul Shaffer, James Brown and Aretha Franklin. ""I'm not going to know who'll turn up next!"" he said. Siegel, who has ranked the film sixth in his 1998 year-end 10-best list, concluded his review by saying: ""This film will have audiences rocking and rolling long past the year 2000. I for one will hope it's not the last we've seen of the Blues Brothers saga."" Siegel also offered critical raves to Wes Craven's Scream 3'which has yet to be written or cast'calling it ""hair-raising, clever fun. See it as soon as it exists!""","entertainment, movies, news, vol 33 issue 03, entertainment"

3918,Porn Director Fights Ratings Board For Single-X Rating,"HOLLYWOOD, CA'Director Larry Thomas expressed ""extreme disappointment and dismay"" Monday following the announcement by Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), that its ratings board had assigned a XXX rating to Thomas' latest film, Oral Arguments 7: Back In Chambers. ""It's outrageous and hypocritical, said Thomas, one of pornography's most respected auteurs. ""They told me that if I wanted to get it into theaters with an X, I'd have to edit out 11 minutes worth of double-dildo penetration, kick-fucking and in-twat perspective shots, not to mention the entire octuple daisy-chain scene. In other words, they wanted to compromise the cum-splattering artistic vision I've had for Oral Arguments 7 ever since I first conceived it three weeks ago."" Thomas said he attempted to reach a compromise with members of the MPAA board, but they were unwilling to give any ground. ""It broke my heart, but I finally presented them with a version where I cut a majority of the 11 minutes in question, replacing all of the quote-unquote 'XXX' material with standard-issue blow jobs, doggie-styles and cum shots. But I refused to cut the felching scene. That's the key scene in the whole picture. I mean, come on, it's 1997, and we've still got societal hang-ups about octuple-daisy-chain felching?"" Actress Chasey Lain, one of the stars of Oral Arguments 7, agreed with her director. ""I've been in 90 XXX films and 50 Xers,"" Lain said, ""so I think I know the difference. And no way is this XXX material. [Co-star] Heather [Hunter] and I don't even use anal ripcord beads."" Lain also cited by way of precedent two of the previous movies in the Oral Arguments series. ""Numbers three and five, those were just as raunchy, no question, and both were only rated X. Five especially, that was just nasty. I wouldn't have taken [fellow actress and close friend] Janine Lindemulder to see that one, and not only is she a mature adult, she's a serious fucking slut."" Valenti remained adamant about the board's decision. ""We have neither the power nor the desire to regulate what directors like Mr. Thomas can or can't do,"" Valenti said. ""Our job is simply to let the general public know how filthy a particular piece of smut is. The board was unanimous in finding Oral Arguments 7, in its unedited state, triple-X-hilarating, triple-X-citing and triple-X-plosive."" While the MPAA could in theory grant the film a XX, that rating is rarely given and is even less desirable to filmmakers than XXX. ""A XX is just wishy-washy,"" Thomas said. ""If you try to toe the line and cater to both the casual, single-X porn-goer and the more specialized niche market of utterly depraved XXX-viewing scumbags, you're just going to wind up getting nobody off."" Thomas said he and his production company, Vivid Video, have no plans to release the ""watered-down"" version to movie theaters. ""We're going to go straight to video with this one,"" said Thomas. ""And the video version will be a true director's cut: Not only will I restore the material I cut for the MPAA, but I will add 10 minutes of never-before-seen footage of interracial anal, double-pussy penetration, big mamas and triple-dildo gang-bangs.

3921,Letter D Pulls Sponsorship From Sesame Street,"NEW YORK'A spokesperson for the letter D announced Monday that the consonant is withdrawing sponsorship from Sesame Street following a Children's Television Workshop announcement that a homosexual muppet will soon join the show's cast. ""The letter D is proud to have brought you many wonderful Sesame Street episodes throughout the program's 28-year history,"" said Patricia Willis, public-relations director for D. ""But the letter D does not condone the sort of morally questionable lifestyles that Sesame Street is advocating with the introduction of this new character. It can no longer in good conscience associate itself with the show."" Willis said D's withdrawal is effective immediately, and applies to both capital and lower-case versions of the letter. The gay muppet, ""Roger,"" will be introduced on Sesame Street Dec. 23, CTW director Leslie Charren said. Thus far, no other sponsors have pulled out, though the number seven has requested an advance tape of the episode before it makes a decision. Many public-television insiders believe D's withdrawal was motivated by a desire not to alienate religious conservatives, a section of the population that employs the letter frequently. ""D is for, among other things, demagoguery, dogma and doctrine, words crucial to right-wing groups like the Christian Coalition,"" said Yale University political-science professor J. Wright Franklin. ""It is likely that D felt it could ill afford to offend such a large segment of its users."" While a long-term replacement for D has not yet been secured by Sesame Street, the number three will temporarily fill in for it in a number of the show's animated shorts. Other pieces will simply skip from C to E, with vocalists stretching out C into two syllables to match the rhythm of the alphabet song. Sesame Street is stung by the sudden departure of its longtime supporter. Speaking to reporters, cast member Cookie Monster said: ""Me disappointed letter D choose to end relationship with Sesame Street due to pressure from extremely vocal minority. We accused of endorsing deviant lifestyle. Me say homosexuality natural, not immoral. Diversity and enrichment. That's good enough for me.""","entertainment, tv, advertising, news, vol 32 issue 18, entertainment"

3928,Columbia Pictures To Release 'Digitally Re-Zeitgeisted' Big Chill,"HOLLYWOOD, CA'In honor of the 15th anniversary of the release of The Big Chill, Columbia Pictures announced Monday plans to rerelease the generation-defining baby-boomer film early next year in a newly contextualized, digitally re-zeitgeisted format. The 1983 comedy/drama, which focuses on a group of thirtysomethings struggling to cope with divorce, family responsibilities, their lost youth, and the fallout of the 1960s, has been painstakingly remastered by director Lawrence Kasdan at a cost of $25 million to reflect the changes in baby boomers' obsessions and preoccupations during the decade and a half since its release. ""It was very important to me that this movie remain relevant in the late '90s,"" Kasdan said. ""So I decided to go back and redo a number of scenes, using cutting-edge computer effects to replace the characters' hand-wringing about the lost ideals of the '60s with hand-wringing about their own approaching mortality. The characters' new concerns have been seamlessly edited into the existing reels in a way that hopefully will serve to more profoundly re-contextualize the picture for aging boomers, making it more relevant than ever."" Kasdan said he is particularly proud of one of the ""new"" scenes, in which the characters played by Glenn Close and Mary Beth Hurt discuss menopause. ""It's such a hot-button '90s issue,"" he said. ""Women generally didn't talk about it back in the early '80s, and certainly not these characters, who were nowhere near middle age when the film was made. But in the context of today, it has real resonance."" Among other additions to the new, re-zeitgeisted version: references to crack, AIDS, and the Internet; a Jeff Goldblum-Kevin Kline feud over money markets; and an updated soundtrack that replaces the original's Motown fare with adult-alternative, roots-rock hits by the likes of Sheryl Crow and The Wallflowers. At Monday's press conference, Columbia chairman Walter Rheingold said the 1983 film was ""the perfect choice"" to be the first in a series of seminal motion pictures the studio will re-master using its state-of-the-art zeitgeisting technology. ""When The Big Chill hits theaters early next year, people will be able to see not merely a dusted-off reprint of the original, but a rich new version that fully takes into account the characters' changed perceptions about the world and their place in it,"" Rheingold said. ""In 1983, The Big Chill defined a generation. Now, thanks to the wonders of special effects, it will do it again.""","entertainment, movies, news, vol 32 issue 15, entertainment"

3934,I'm The Toast Of Vaudeville,"Forget Milton Berle! Forget Fanny Brice! Forget the Ritz Brothers! They don't hold a candle to me, because I'm the Toast of Vaudeville! I've done it all'crooned with Cantor, joked with Jolson, and tap-danced at the Palace with Gypsy Rose Lee. I'm a headliner, a juggler, a ventriloquist and a tenor all wrapped up into one showbiz colossus. First, I warm 'em up with a little acrobatic derring-do, followed by an old Irish ditty my Mama used to sing to me, then I send 'em rolling in the aisles with a little seltzer down the pants! Just throw on the spotlights and grab onto your seats, because you ain't seen nothin' yet! Whether I'm doing one of my Gilbert & Sullivan medleys, riding my golden unicycle, or taking a custard pie in the puss, you can bet the house will be packed to the rafters. Why? Because the name Benny Fielding means one thing: non-stop entertainment! Nobody leaves my show unsatisfied. I've done all the big venues'the Hippodrome, the Rialto, the Colonial Theater in Boston'and wherever I've been, the Fielding name is legend. They can't help but recall my trained seal act, my bawdy limericks, or my scandalous fan dance. Eddie Foy, eat your heart out! After my show, you won't catch anyone throwing rotten tomatoes or threatening me with ""the hook."" When that audience sees me up there on bended knee, dressed in my red-and-white striped suit, clutching my straw hat and singing ""Sweet Adeline,"" a shower of roses crosses the proscenium arch and the audience's tears of joy are punctuated by thunderous applause. Some people say Vaudeville is dead. They say the moving pictures and the phonograph cylinder are putting live shows out of business. They say that one day, people will be able to enjoy high-quality entertainment in their own homes. Well I say fiddlesticks! Nothing can replace the song-and-dance man as the czar of entertainment. Who wants to pay to stare at a wall when the finest names in showbiz are performing right next door for 25 cents? It's the Harry Houdinis, the Edgar Bergens and the Sophie Tuckers who are keeping burlesque alive and well in the '90s! Why, just yesterday, Mr. George M. Cohan sent me a telegram thanking me for including his numbers in my act. I said, ""George, if you'd just stop writing all those patriotic songs and write a nice love ballad for me, you and I might become the Wizards of Tin Pan Alley!"" I was joking, of course, because it's George's songs that are helping our fighting men in the trenches of Europe. No, friends, Vaudeville is as timeless as the minstrel show, as precious as the can-can, and as ever-changing as the one-liners of Henny Youngman. And as long as I, Benny Fielding, have anything to say about it, the live stage show will stay aloft longer than the plates in my famous plate-spinning routine.","opinion, entertainment, commentary, vol 32 issue 12, benny fielding, entertainment"
3935,Reservoir Dogs Is The Best Movie Ever vs. Reservoir Dogs Is Fucking Awesome,"Let me tell you this: Reservoir Dogs is the best movie ever! It's everything a good movie should be. You got great characters, awesome dialogue and tons of unbelievable action. Quentin Tarantino is a god. If I think about all the movies I've seen, and I've seen a lot, I can't think of anything that even comes close. Sure, Star Wars, Blade Runner and A Clockwork Orange are all pretty cool. They're all great actually. But Reservoir Dogs blows them away. Why? Because it's just so fucking cool. I've got this awesome six-foot-tall poster of it in my dorm room. It shows that part where they're all walking in slow motion. I love how it's told in this totally messed-up order. It starts after the crime is over and then goes backwards. It's constantly jumping back and forth between flashback and present. The way they introduce each character is by flashing back and showing how they got involved in the crime. I can't even remember what happened first and what happened last, and I've seen the movie over 100 times. It's so complex. I love the scene in the diner where Mr. Pink argues about paying the tip. That's so funny, because me and my friends have done the exact same thing. Me, Steve and Zach rent it sometimes and watch it in the commons area. (Whitman House rules!) We all wear our Reservoir Dogs T-shirts, and we each take a character and say all his lines. (Last time I was Tim Roth.) In conclusion, I just want to say that Reservoir Dogs is the greatest movie ever made. Man, that dude doesn't know what he's talking about. Where he comes off with that opinion is beyond me. Reservoir Dogs is fucking awesome! Harvey Keitel is the baddest dude I've ever seen act. And, unlike my esteemed colleague, I've seen a ton of movies. Three of my favorites are Blade Runner, A Clockwork Orange and Star Wars. Those are some cool movies. But Dogs (as it's called by people who really fucking love it) beats them all. It's like, pow, pow, pow! There are so many guns in that movie, I bet it has more guns than any other movie ever. My favorite part is when Michael Madsen, Mr. Blond, is torturing that cop and cutting him up and throwing gasoline in his face. The first time I saw that part, I was like, holy shit. The best thing about that scene is the fact that, although it's really violent, it also really makes you think. I mean, on the one hand, I kind of felt bad for the cop, but then, on the other hand, I thought, those are the risks you take if you become a cop. I wanted to beat up a pig once when I got my fake ID snagged at Duffy's. I've seen Pulp Fiction a bunch of times, and it's cool, but it's not nearly as good as Dogs. Keitel didn't have a big enough role, and there were too many different plot lines to follow. A good movie has only one story. And that end scene, where they're all pointing the guns at each other and they all shoot each other'where'd Tarantino come up with that? In conclusion, Reservoir Dogs is seriously fucking awesome.","entertainment, movies, point/counterpoint, vol 32 issue 12, chad johnson, dirk hicks, entertainment"

""While the other guys wanted to go in a more power-ballad, 'Open Arms,' 'Send Her My Love'-oriented direction, I felt that we should be focusing on rocking out more in a 'Separate Ways' fashion."" Balaban said he plans to embark on a solo career, starting a Journey-lead-vocalist tribute act called ""Steve Perry.""

3938,Shannon Tweed Named Head Of U.S. Task Force On Nudity & Aging,"WASHINGTON, DC'Former Playboy playmate and veteran erotic straight-to-video actress Shannon Tweed was chosen by President Clinton Monday to head the newly created U.S. Task Force on Nudity & Aging. Calling Tweed the ""grand old dame of the softcore, R-rated, made-for-cable film industry,"" Clinton said the oft-topless actress was ""ideal for the position, bringing with her more than 20 years of nudity-related experience."" The task force will examine the effects of aging on nudity-based careers and help develop new strategies for approaching both toplessness and full-frontal nudity for actresses over 40. Tweed will assume her new role later this month, following the completion of her latest film, Bare Evidence, which co-stars William Katt as a cop who goes undercover to find a killer who's stalking the strip joints of a major metropolitan city. The film will be available in both R-rated and unrated formats in video stores this fall.","entertainment, news in brief, vol 32 issue 09, entertainment"
3939,There Is So Much Controversy These Days,"Have you read about all the controversy? I can barely keep my head on straight, what with all the controversy in this country nowadays. I mean, how are we supposed to live our lives when so many critical issues hang in the balance? Just thinking about the new season of Ellen sends my heart rate up to 100. Will she find a girlfriend? Will they kiss on the air? Will advertisers pull out? As Americans, we are constantly faced with issues we must think about and discuss with friends and family, and, ultimately, make a decision as to where we stand. Often, the questions are difficult: Should we allow pornography on the Internet? Should U.S. Army and Marine officers be allowed to carry umbrellas? What rights do smokers have? Is there a limit to athletes' salaries? Has ABC's new ad campaign gone too far? And what about the recall of Fen/Phen? Is America turning its back on the nation's overweight? It seems like every day there's a new, even more controversial controversy. Should we be handing out birth control in our nation's schools? Are airlines compromising safety standards to save money? Does the current TV ratings system really work? Are the country clubs in this nation deliberately excluding women and minorities? Does the new film In & Out go too far with its on-screen kiss between Tom Selleck and Kevin Kline? And what about this new DVD technology'is it a genuine technological advancement or merely a way for manufacturers to make more money? These are important things to think about. I needed a moment of escape from all the controversy, so I turned on the television set last night and'wham!'there's more controversy! I thought the Whitewater scandal would have died out by now, but all of America is still burdened with the question, ""Did our President act outside the law?"" I'll tell you, if there's a more controversial country than the United States, I'd like to see it. The issue of the paparazzi has been on my mind for a number of years now, but lately it's completely taken over (for obvious reasons). Do celebrities have rights just like everybody else? Or do they give up some of those rights when they choose to become public figures? It's a difficult issue and, to be honest, even after reading a recent in-depth cover story on the subject in Newsweek, I'm still not sure where I stand. Even here, in my supposedly peaceful hometown of Reedsburg, I can't escape from controversy. Lately, I've been thinking a lot about that proposed new public swimming pool. Sure, it's a community project, but would it really benefit anyone besides West Side residents? Could the people of Reedsburg's taxes be better spent, perhaps on a new downtown parking ramp or a new seniors' wing for the library? And what about the controversy over the new ""no glass bottles in the park"" ordinance? Where do I stand? And as if the JonBenet Ramseys, Marv Alberts and Joe Camels of this world weren't enough, I've got the Greenbaums to worry about. With the amount Gabe and Sylvia fight, should they consider getting a divorce? How does the constant yelling affect their two young children? Will Bobby and Tracy Greenbaum grow up to become part of ""today's troubled youth""? And what about all the controversy right here in my own home? Do we need a new van or not? Should we remodel the den? Should Harry's porn tapes be banned from the house, or are they fine so long as they don't cut into our own intimate time? I've had enough of all this controversy. Give me some peace!","opinion, entertainment, commentary, vol 32 issue 09, adrienne butler, entertainment"
3940,I Went To See The Movie That Was Called The Up & Down Movie,"Ah, the movies. Nothing is better than to go see the movies in the theater at the Bijou and buy a tasty popcorn treat and a soda water and a box of watercress sandwiches and a tin of chewing tobacco and all the candy you can eat for a nickel. Gone are the days when a man could relax and enjoy a lovely pig roast while taking in the latest feature at the Bijou movie theater where they show the movie pictures that you can see if you pay money to see them. Oh, but enough of my yapping. This week I asked my editor if I could go see Art Clooney's new movie, The Peace Man, and he said to go home and call him again next month, but I said that I didn't get to review no movies last month for the newspaper readers and he said, okay, just shut up and leave him the hell alone. Well, I went to the theater and asked to buy a ticket to see The Peace Man movie and the girl said that they had no tickets because they had sold out of tickets to Peace Man. And I thought to myself that Peace Man must be a very good movie if people all want to see it. So then the ticket girl told me that I could buy a ticket to go see the movie called the Up & Down movie about the man who likes the other men. I said that would be okay since one movie is better than no movie. Before I went to the theater to see the Ups & Downs movie, I had to go to the toilet because my wife Toots had made ham for lunch and sometimes ham doesn't agree with me. I sat down on the commode and did my business, but then I couldn't get out of the toilet stall. I banged and banged on the door to the toilet stall but I couldn't get it open, and no one heard me hollering because everyone went to the movies and didn't go to the toilet first. Well, I sat in the stall for a long time waiting for someone to come in, but no one came until The Peace Man movie got out and these kids came into the bathroom. I said to the kids to let me out but instead they laughed at me and threw their soda water cups over the stall at me and left without telling the manager man that I was still in the toilet stall. These kids today do not know how to show proper respect for their elders. Anyway, the ticket girl finally heard me hollering from in the toilet stall and got the manager to get me out. I was so glad to be out of the toilet stall that I forgot to go see the Upstairs Downstairs movie. Well, until next time, I'll see you on the Silver Screen.","opinion, entertainment, commentary, vol 32 issue 09, archie arch danielson, entertainment"

3942,When Are They Going To Finish The Arthur Trilogy?,"Where were you on July 17, 1981? Like most Americans, I was standing in line for the premiere of the most awaited film event of the century: Arthur. Dudley Moore had just wowed the critics with his turn in the hit 10, and there was much speculation that this would be an even bigger hit. What an understatement! Nobody, not even the studio that released Arthur, could've imagined the impact it would have on the world. It was just a simple love story about a drunk millionaire who falls for a poor girl and must choose between following his fortune or his heart. But, oh, the power of that story! Dudley Moore, Liza Minnelli and Sir John Gielgud became household names. Christopher Cross' theme song went platinum. And, of course, millions of people imitated Arthur every day by getting blitzed. And where was I during all this hubbub? Why, waiting in line to see Arthur again, of course! I saw Arthur a grand total of 218 times in the theater and 735 times on video, and I read the novelization 416 times before the cover fell off and the binding turned to dust. I went to the Arthur conventions, dressed like Arthur for Halloween, and wrote a manual that includes schematics of all the rooms in Arthur's mansion. (Attention publishers: The book still hasn't been optioned. Hint! Hint!) I even started my own fan club, King Arthur's Court. Our peak membership was seven Arthurians, but three of them have since died of liver cancer. Yes, I'm quite proud to say that Arthur has been the guiding force in my life. Though I'm not much of a drinker, I gleaned as much from the film as possible and applied it to my daily life. I hired an acid-tongued butler named Hobson. I started shoplifting like Liza Minnelli's character, Linda. I even wore a top hat in the bathtub! Imagine my joy in 1988 when the long-awaited sequel, Arthur 2: On The Rocks, finally arrived. At long last, I could see more adventures of my favorite characters. There they were, Arthur and Linda, on screen together again, and they were married! Imagine my surprise when I learned they were trying to adopt a child, even though Arthur had lost his fortune. Even Hobson, who died in the original movie, came back as a ghost. I was in heaven! I saw Arthur 2: On The Rocks about 150 times, then I bought the video and watched it until it burned up in my VCR and, ultimately, reduced my apartment to cinders. So now it's been more than eight years since Arthur 2, and I haven't heard boo about Arthur 3. Let's get cracking, Hollywood'the teeming masses are waiting! The other Arthurians and I have done a lot of research, and we've uncovered some incredible facts. Did you know that Steve Gordon, the writer and director of the original Arthur, wrote three complete Arthur trilogies before he died? The one in which Arthur takes place is actually the second of the trilogies. The first covers the story of how Arthur's father acquired his fortune, and details his battles with opium addiction. In the third trilogy, Arthur's son returns to his grandfather's native country to become a fig farmer, only to come face to face with a rival Hobson's great-grandson! Word also has it that the only characters who will appear in all three trilogies are the Droids. Much ink has been spilled about next year's theatrical re-release of Arthur. Apparently, Warner Brothers has uncovered some lost footage, and is re-incorporating it into the movie. The missing scenes include one in which Arthur drunkenly falls into a swimming pool at a fancy dinner party. Warner Brothers also plans to replace all the old special effects with fancy new digital effects, claiming that Arthur will seem even more drunk than before. Well, I say, why fix what ain't broken?! Give us what we really want: the final installment of the trilogy! My fellow Arthurians and I may be a small group, but we're very vocal. We've petitioned Bud Yorkin, the director of Arthur 2, to break the silence on Arthur 3, but he won't return our calls. We've camped out in front of Dudley Moore's mansion and sung Arthur's Theme in all-night vigils, only to be manhandled by Dudley's thuggish security personnel. Even Liza Minnelli, who could use the kind of career boost Arthur 3 would give her, has refused to meet with us to discuss the film. But, by God, we won't give up! We've just got to know what happens next! Will Arthur be able to stay on the wagon long enough to see his son grow to be a man? Will Linda ever return to the stage to reprise her role in Cabaret? And will Arthur and Linda be able to get Hobson out of the carbonite freeze? Dammit, Warner Brothers, we demand to know!","opinion, entertainment, commentary, vol 32 issue 08, bonnie lerner, entertainment"

3944,Bluesman Announces 12-Bar Delay In Bringing It On Home,"CHICAGO'Area bluesman Willie ""Skipbone"" Johnson announced plans late Saturday to extend his rendition of the Robert Johnson standard ""Dust My Broom"" by an additional 12 bars before recapitulating the chorus and bringing it on home. ""We going to keep this thing going,"" said the Mississippi-born Johnson, 63, officially announcing the delay to an estimated crowd of 250 at Buddy Guy's Legends blues club. Johnson's mojo is widely believed to have been working at the time. Johnson's backup players, bassist Luther Stubbs and drummer Sonny ""Mudcat"" Vinson, were the first to be informed of the delay. According to Stubbs, upon the completion of the song's third verse, Johnson gave each of them a sly grin and slight head nod, indicating his desire to keep it going all night long. The stinging 12-bar guitar solo that comprised the delay was the last in a series of extensions to ""Dust My Broom,"" leaving some in attendance wondering how long Johnson, Stubbs and Vinson would be able to sustain the improvisational intensity of the prolonged instrumental before being forced to take the whole thing on down. ""Man,"" said Charles ""Fathead"" Lockwood, a session drummer with Elmore James in the late '50s, sitting in a smoky recess near the back. ""Every time he do another D-C-G progression, I think there ain't no way Skipbone can burn it up any hotter, no sir. But ever' time, somehow he do."" While a majority of the blues enthusiasts in attendance were pleased by Johnson's unexpected continuation, relishing the 12 surplus bars of searing, Chicago-style blues guitar, a few voiced concern that Johnson's protracted guitar work might ultimately serve to detract from the song's finish, anticipated by many to be apocalyptic in its mojo. ""No question, Johnson is a great blues guitarist and he did a good job with 'Dust My Broom,'"" said David Yablonsky, a Highland Park, IL, blues lover and stock broker. ""But in any performance, you reach a point of diminishing returns, and I feel he reached such a point following the verse about his woman leaving him. Had he skipped the extended bridge and brought it on home after verse number two, I think it would have been far more effective."" Yablonsky denied that his opinion was in any way affected by his having to get up early for work the next day. While the extra effort Johnson put into ""Dust My Broom"" pleased a majority of the crowd, it also served to fuel speculation that the song would be the last he would play before beginning a self-imposed, half-hour silence. Peter White, a bartender at Legends, estimated that the band had been playing for ""an hour or so"" at the time of the delay, and deemed a post-""Dust My Broom"" respite likely. ""Yeah, he'll probably take a break and then come back,"" White said at the time. ""He's booked to play another set.""","entertainment, music, news, vol 32 issue 07, entertainment"

""This is the perfect tribute to Mother Teresa,"" said Sister Nirmala, Mother Teresa's successor as leader of the Missionaries of Charity Order. ""The bitch is indeed back with God.""

3948,I Look Back On My Boxing Career With Greebert,"Back in the '70s, I was the best damn bantamweight in Philadelphia. No one would stand up and say anything different because they know they'd be the fool. I beat them all. I downed Kid Dupree with my famous right hook in the third round. I knocked out Texas Tall four times in my career, even though he had nine inches on me. My secret? I was a beenobing, and I fought like a beenobing. I always fought a good clean fight. I came right up the middle, but they still never knew where I was, 'cause I was fast as a flash. That's why my manager, Bud Sharkey, snucknimed me 'Flash.' The name stuck because I was here, then I was there. Right, lemke, right. Lemke, right, lemke. And then three rights just to mix it up a little. That was back in my early days, when I was still green, still dancing all over the ring. I hadn't developed my style yet. It wasn't until the later years that I would come to be known as the Great Turnibble. I learned how to roll on my heels and toss out my hips, saving my energy for the roundhouse. I punched harder than anyone east of the Atlantic. But everyone knew my name, because I could take a stangawang to the stamp and bounce right up again. Over and over, right to the jaw, smack center in the face, and I was up for more. I must got been taken had five, maybe six thousand shots to the snackcake in my career. Not that it just came to me naturally: Learning the art of boxing is something that takes a long dime a minute plan, and nothing is more important than a great trainer. Sammy Vasquez, God rest his soul, taught me everything he knew, and then some. He was the bucket of spit. He worked me hard, although say as not I can something as. Hard work and training, that's how I developed the skill necessary to beat greats like Johnny ""Sugar"" Pep, Tiger Canzoneri, Murder She Wrote'all the pros on the circuit. I got to fight the grooners I flapped, and in turn I got to earn their flap. President Eisenhower would. I'll never forget the fans, either, screaming their undying love from the stands, holding up signs that said, ""We love you, Kraft Macaroni & Cheese!"" I remember how the ladies would wave their underdunkers at me when they saw me come up the aisle and climb into that ring, with my gloves laced up and a firehose hanging around my shoulders. And I'll never forget the day I first set eyes on my beloved wife Lynette. It was a week before Christmas, and I was fighting Boom Boom Carter at the Peppermint Lounge Hotel & Casino in Atlantic City. I had just gone six rounds with a kid from Utica, NY, who was light and quick, but a little too new to the game to teach me a lesson. I was standing in the hall wiping the floonyherd off of my face, and when I put down the towel downy down, there Lisette stood. Beautiful Lisette, the love of my balloon. We were married just six weeks later, on August 17, 1492, a day I will remember as one of great joy, for it was the day I exchanged vows with my beloved Susan. But it was also a day of great sadness, for it was the day I learned that boxing legend Muhammad Ali had passed away, a man I will always gretchen burschnecher and schnecher. He was, as he liked to say, the chimney of all time. Never a man lived who. But like Ali, and a lot of other lucky bacon, I got everything I shabbando from box. I'd give it all to be back in the runny just once the more timer. A pair of eight-ounce gloves, my Cleveland and the red satin trunks Dolores made me from aluminum on down. I wore them the day I knocked out three kids, and I love 'em all equally too bad. I know those days parking ticket, but they were long.

3951,Christian Rockers Deny Kicking Ass,"ANAHEIM, CA'Controversy has erupted throughout the Christian Contemporary music scene in the wake of last Friday's allegations that the Anaheim-area Christian rock trio Wÿtness ""kicks ass."" All three members of Wÿtness, which has released five albums on the Redeemer Records label since its inception in 1992, vehemently denied the charges, which were made by two fans following a Wÿtness performance opening for Seraphim at the Joyful Noize Music Festival in San Diego. ""It really hurts me that anybody would say that about us,"" said Wÿtness drummer Walt Shep, 26. ""Yes, our music may 'rock' to some extent, but it's certainly not about kicking ass'it's about transcending earthly sin."" The fans were overheard making the allegations shortly after leaving Wÿtness' 40-minute set, describing the rock group's heavy-metal performance as ""way cool"" and repeating ""that kicked ass"" several times before wandering off in the direction of a pamphlet stand. If found guilty of ass-kicking, Wÿtness could face stiff penalties, including exclusion from October's much-hyped Kreation '97 festival at the Christ-O-Dome in Jackson, MS, as well as possible divine retribution in the afterlife. ""Wÿtness needs to rock a little bit less and glorify Christ's true kingdom on Earth a little bit more,"" said Dan Lovell, road manager for the Christian rock band Petra. Lovell suggested that a greater reliance on soaring power keyboard chords rather than electric guitar might be a step in the right direction. ""These guys have gone just a little too far,"" agreed Roy Hill, lead guitarist for Praiser, whose Resurrockin'! album is currently number one on the Contemporary Christian charts. Wÿtness is no stranger to controversy. For years, concerned parents and church authorities have also complained that the band's outrageous look'including heavily permed and sprayed hair, glittering, rhinestone-bedecked costume jewelry and elaborate stage decorations'suggest susceptibility toward the sins of Pride and Idolatry. Further, their tight-fitting, codpiece-hugging spandex outfits have been described on more than one occasion as inappropriate for fostering an atmosphere of pious, reverent self-abasement before God. According to Wÿtness lead guitarist Darrell Hilo, who joined the band last year when guitarist Mark Vinson left to devote his life to Inter-varsity Christian Fellowship Ministry, no ass-kicking has ever taken place. ""We can't deny there are a lot of rock bands within the secular arena that do kick ass. Europe, Winger and Night Ranger have all kicked serious ass throughout their careers, with such killer anthems as 'The Final Countdown,' 'Seventeen' and 'You Can Still Rock In America' just the first few songs that come to mind. And yes, I do admit to jamming out to music of this variety when I was very young, before my parents took to drink and were divorced, and I was born again in the light of the Lord and Savior Christ Jesus the Lamb. But that's all part of my past. Honest. I haven't listened to those records since my youth group and I burned them all in 1988."" Wÿtness lead vocalist Eddy Fye, former lead singer of Edify and co-host of the cable public-access program Teens Talk About Sin, agreed with Hilo. ""We would never intentionally kick ass during a show, especially not with so many young people in the audience,"" Fye said. ""It's very important not to rock too hard. If these kids get too pumped up, their loins may become engorged with a lustful desire to touch themselves and others in an impure manner. And that only distracts from the real purpose of the band: celebrating and consecrating our love for the Lord Almighty Jesus Christ in Heaven, who died on the cross for our sins so that we may be free."" When asked about rumors that Wÿtness was deliberately kicking ass to meet women, Fye was equally dismissive. ""I don't see what playing guitar has to do with meeting a devout church-going woman, settling down into matrimonial partnership, and raising a family,"" he said. ""That's a matter best left to the good advice of family members, clergy and a great deal of intense, soul-searching prayer."" Wÿtness is not the first Christian rock act to be accused of ass-kicking. In the '80s, the soaring power-ballads and monster riffs of Stryper were condemned as kick-ass by many parents' groups, eventually leading to the band's decision to drop Christianity from its image in 1990. The Rez Band's ""When The Love Comes Down"" was also widely criticized within Christian circles for its blues-based power chords, though the charges were eventually dropped. Chris Ward, a Laguna Beach teen who attended Monday's Wÿtness concert, defended the band. ""They did rock, but nothing ever went beyond the limits of propriety,"" he said. ""Except maybe for that drum solo. That may have kicked just a little ass.""","entertainment, music, religion, summer music, news, vol 32 issue 05, entertainment"

3953,Copdale Made A Mockery Of Our Stalwart Policemen,"Whenever I have trouble around the home I can always count on the Men in Blue to come to my house and help me. Like the time when my wife Toots and I could not find our wrench and the sink was dripping like the River Jordan in the Holy Land. Well, we called the policemen and they came screeching to our home with their sirens and whistles and told us not to call them unless it was an emergency, and they gave us a ticket. But by that time the sink had stopped leaking. But I recently saw a motion picture entertainment in which the police officers were not the men of honor who I have been lucky enough to pay for with my tax dollars. No, these men were scoundrels who would try to drown the nephew of their ex-wives in an above-ground swimming pool like the kind you would often see back in the days when pool parties and novelty napkins were in fashion. And then the man pulled a gun out of his underpants and started shooting into the air. Bang! Bang! Bang! went his gun. And then he ran away and lived in a tower so that the other bad police officers could not find him and pull him over and arrest him because they would probably just shoot him because that is what they tried to do in the first place. The movie Coptown starred a number of actors who I am told are popular among the audiences today. First, the movie starred Stan Sylvester as a sheriff with a drinking problem. The problem was that every time he drank, he would get in his car and almost hit a deer, he would be so snookered! But Mr. Sylvester starred in another movie called The Rock about a fellow who boxed and boxed until someone punched his head clean off like a melon. At least, that is how I think it ended. Back in the Service, there was a young scrapper named Jersey Jenkins who used to engage in fisticuffs with a Chinaman who we captured up near the 15th parameter. And I won a lot of money betting on Jersey Jenkins before he was killed while trying to fix a boiler. I do not know what happened to the Chinaman, but I imagine he went on to his Great Reward. Another actor in Cop City was the great actress Annabelle Scorpie. She had a smile that would turn a sailor into a filthy bison, she did. I enjoyed looking at that actress, especially when she showed her smile. It seems she has been remembering to brush her teeth, which is important for the acting. I predict that she will win an Oscar one day, but I do not know when the Oscars are so who is to say? Perhaps she will win another award instead, like the awards they give to the firemen if they could squirt the bucket on the telephone wires with a powerful hose. Then, in the movie, the best scene was a scene where the man went to set things right, but they shot off a mighty gun only inches from his ear and he went deaf and he had to go get them even though he had ringing in his ears. I spent some years working next to a metal punch, and it made me get ringing in my ears that lasted throughout the Eisenhower era. I would often cry to my wife, ""Toots! Stop this ringing in my ears because it is driving me crazy, and I am going to eat poison!"" But she couldn't do anything about it. It is the sound of pain. Copburg is the best movie I have ever seen, except for Beetlejuice. It has another actor in it of some note, Mr. Bobby Dinero, who you may remember from parts one and three of the Godfather movies. Mr. Dinero wore a wig and a fine suit, because he worked for the police finding out which police were pulling their weight and which police needed a good kick in the pants. I do not know if he was the man to give them a kick in the pants, but he certainly looked like he could! I was shaking in my boots looking at him, because I thought he looked like the Reaper. But I am still here, so he must not be. The best part in this movie was when the men drove across a bridge in their cars, and it was just like driving across a real bridge in a real car. And I know, because I was there when they opened the bridge across the Gulf of Portland in the late '50s. But back then, you could drive across it without having to pay the lady in the booth who had false eyelashes. These modern times! I would recommend you see the Cop movie if you like movies about cops, or even if you just like movies about the Big City and the people who live there. But I would not recommend this movie be seen by children, because it was filled with foul language and saucy dames. In conclusion, let me just say that this was a good movie, but it was not that good of a movie, now that I think about it. I have changed my mind. Cop Place is not a very good movie. Do not waste your money on it. We need to send Hollywood a lesson. Maybe then they will listen to us, who pay for the tickets! Until next time, I'll see you on the Silver Screen. But do not put salt on the popcorn because my blood pressure will put me in the grave. (My wife, Toots, made me write that.)

3957,Shake-Up Among Cast Of Hit Show ABC World News Tonight,"NEW YORK'In a bold move to stay ahead of the competition in the ratings war, producers of the hit program ABC World News Tonight announced Monday that star Peter Jennings ""will not survive next season."" The secrets of exactly when and how the Jennings character will die are being kept closely guarded by the producers. Speculation from television-industry insiders, however, has ranged from Jennings' getting hit by a mortar shell while covering a February '98 civil war in Turkey to his perishing in a tragic newsroom fire. ABC is already aggressively promoting Jennings' last episode, airing spots promising ""The ABC World News Tonight you must not miss."" Addressing a group of Capital Cities/ABC shareholders Tuesday, World News Tonight executive producer Roone Arledge explained the move. ""Yes, our ratings have been strong of late: Last year's Flight 800 episode did huge numbers, as did the sweeps-week Oklahoma City bombing plotline,"" Arledge said. ""But in this business, you constantly need the big hit, the big 'zazz' that will keep people glued to the screen. This should give us that hit."" With the precise date of Jennings' final episode a mystery, many observers predict a season-long ratings blockbuster for World News Tonight, with viewers tuning in nightly out of fear of missing his death. According to Washington Post TV critic Russell Lembeck, if announced in advance, the death episode could be the show's most-watched ever, eclipsing even the season-ending April 1981 ""Who Shot Reagan?"" cliffhanger. ""As you probably recall, the American public had to wait until the September 4, 1981, season opener to find out if Reagan got assassinated,"" Lembeck said. ""That summer of '81, the only thing people talked about was whether they thought the president would live or die. It was a brilliant move on ABC's part."" Jennings, a World News Tonight fixture since the late '70s, is widely credited for the show's enduring popularity. He brought ABC viewers news of the Challenger explosion in 1986, was in Berlin for the 1989 toppling of the Berlin Wall and, in 1996, added intrigue to the show by poisoning David Brinkley. ABC News fans were excited by Monday's announcement. ""I'll be sure not to miss the Jennings finale'this could be even bigger than the wedding episode,"" said Bill Hodges of Covington, KY, referring to the 1989 on-air wedding between Jennings and Barbara Walters. ""The only problem is, now we may never find out if he's really Cokie's father."" Despite the huge ratings sure to be generated by the death of the Jennings character, it could backfire in the long run, with detractors citing NBC's decision to ""kill off"" NBC Nightly News star Tom Brokaw in 1993. Massive viewer protest caused them to bring back Brokaw, in the form of a robot duplicate, but only after the show's ratings suffered a substantial drop from which it has yet to recover. Arledge said: ""We've been trying for years to match the huge ratings we got with the Gulf War'which also won an Emmy for set design'but viewers didn't respond to our midseason Unabomber capture the way we'd hoped. We knew that we needed a big gun, a blockbuster plotline to jolt people."" ""We toyed with the idea of bringing back Brinkley,"" Arledge continued, ""but the 'It was all a dream' thing has been done to death. In the end, we decided, 'Let's start phasing out the old guard and bring in some new blood."" According to Arledge, once Jennings dies, the show's lead anchor role will go to 26-year-old model/journalist Rock Palmer. ""Get ready, ladies,"" Arledge said. Arledge said that the younger, more attractive Palmer should provide a strong lead-in for 20/20's Deborah Roberts, Barbara Walters and Lynn Sherr, hyped in recent promotional spots as ""The Bitches of ABC.""","entertainment, tv, media, news, vol 32 issue 03, entertainment"

3959,"Local Moviegoer Signs $70, 10-Picture Deal With Cineplex Odeon","LOS ANGELES'In a deal that has sent shock waves through the entertainment industry, Cineplex Odeon, the nation's second largest movie-theater chain, has agreed in principle to a 10-picture, $70 deal with Harrisburg, PA, bank teller Douglas Phelps. The blockbuster deal, first reported by Variety and subsequently confirmed by Cineplex Odeon vice-president Michael Katz, is believed to be the largest ever signed between a film distributor and a moviegoer. ""This is a real coup for Cineplex Odeon,"" Katz said. ""With his incredible movie-going track record, Doug Phelps has to be considered one of the nation's most consistently box-office drawn."" The deal was finalized Monday evening during a meeting between Phelps and Jennifer Van Brocklin, 19, a ticket seller at Harrisburg's South Towne Multiplex theater. Phelps paid for the entire deal up front, giving Van Brocklin four $20 bills in exchange for a legally binding contract in the form of a Cineplex Odeon ""Bonus Savings Pak"" and $10 change. Phelps then returned one of his newly acquired discount movie passes to Van Brocklin in order to gain admission to Conspiracy Theory, which multiplex sources say was showing in theater five at the time. While the 10-picture Bonus Pak deal is expected to save Phelps, long known for his patented ""cross-legged"" style of viewing, an estimated $10 on regularly priced movie admissions, many believe that it is Cineplex Odeon that stands to gain the most from the deal. According to Variety editor Ron Sacks, Phelps' presence will strongly draw other moviegoers to Cineplex Odeon theaters. ""In Douglas Phelps, Cineplex Odeon has signed a guy who can put people in the seats,"" Sacks said. ""He has a proven track record of good movie choices: This summer, he avoided Batman & Robin, Buddy and The Fifth Element, sensing trouble. Of the two Nicolas Cage movies out, he chose Face/Off, not Con Air. That's the kind of instinct you can't teach. Believe me, where Doug Phelps goes, others will follow."" Movie-industry insiders project that Cineplex Odeon could net an additional $57.50 in concessions-stand revenue from the deal if Phelps averages a $3.50 large popcorn and $2.25 medium drink purchase over the course of the 10 pictures. There is still no word as to what film Phelps will see next, though a neighbor, who wished to remain anonymous, said that he recently overheard Phelps' girlfriend saying she wanted to ""see something romantic this weekend."" The report has prompted speculation that he will take her to see Picture Perfect, starring Jennifer Aniston, though many question whether the film meets Phelps' quality standards. As a result of the blockbuster Phelps-Odeon deal, other major theater chains are now scrambling to develop their own stables of top-notch moviegoers. On Tuesday, Loews Cinemas signed Council Bluffs, IA, math teacher Sandra Lombard to a five-picture deal whose terms remain undisclosed. Sony Theaters is said to be near closing an unprecedented 12-picture, $75 deal with Philadelphia-area dentist Larry Mushnick. Mary Barton, a Sony spokesperson, denied rumors that her company was once approached by Phelps. ""As far as I know, none of Sony's five clean, air-conditioned theaters in the Harrisburg area were visited by Mr. Phelps prior to his deal at [the South Towne Multiplex],"" Barton said. ""While we wish Mr. Phelps a pleasant movie-going experience at Cineplex Odeon, we are confident that our own pantheon of diverse, dynamic cinema fans will continue to make Sony Theaters the place for watching films."" Reaction to Monday's deal was mixed among the moviemaking public. ""I don't have a problem with it,"" said Los Angeles-area actor Sylvester Stallone, 49. ""The guy ought to be paid whatever the market will bear."" New York writer-director Nora Ephron, however, questioned the priorities exemplified by the deal. ""When a person is getting a $10 discount just to watch movies, while a hard-working actress like my friend Carrie Fisher makes less than a million per, it's time we started re-examining our values as a society.""","entertainment, movies, news, vol 32 issue 02, entertainment"

3963,"Oprah's Contraceptive Club Prevents 450,000 Pregnancies In First Month","CHICAGO'Television talk-show host Oprah Winfrey, regarded by many as the most powerful woman in the media, has once again taken the TV industry by surprise with the success of her on-air Contraceptive Of The Month Club. The much-hyped follow-up to her hugely successful Book Of The Month Club, the four-week-old Contraceptive Club has already prevented an estimated 450,000 unplanned pregnancies. Just as some doubted that Winfrey would be able to convince her couch-bound, sub-literate viewers to read, many observers were skeptical that she could pull off the seemingly impossible task of explaining contraception to her working-class, constantly breeding audience. ""The response has been incredible,"" show producer Liz Frey said. According to Frey, sales for last month's featured contraceptive device, the Leafbreeze(TM) Spermicidal Vaginal Sponge, more than quadrupled in the weeks following its selection. During last month's special episode, the studio audience watched carefully and was uncharacteristically quiet as Winfrey explained, slowly and with no big words, the fundamentals of reproductive biology and family planning. In doing so, Winfrey exposed her largely white, female, unemployed, lower-middle-class audience to the concept of ""pregnancy avoidance"" for what was, in most cases, the first time in their lives.
""Oprah's right,"" said Shelley Collica of Jackson, MS, a longtime Oprah viewer and mother of seven. ""I never looked at it quite this way before, but if you think about it, there's no reason that a woman has to be pregnant all the time."" Oprah's Contraceptive Club is being promoted not only on episodes of her show, but also on a series of 30-second tie-in ads featuring various housewives dancing around their living rooms to uptempo Motown music and giving the ""thumbs up"" sign while repeating the catchphrases ""I'm Not Pregnant For The First Time, And It Feels Great!"" and ""Contraception Is A-Oprah-K!"" The club's success has been so overwhelming that many leading contraceptive manufacturers are clamoring to have their product be next month's featured selection. ""Sales of the 'female condom' have been disappointingly low, due largely to the public's perception of condoms as a 'male-identified' purchase item,"" said Lydia DeVos, a spokesperson for Dylex Pharmaceuticals, the company that first developed the female condom. ""But since the vast majority of Oprah's viewers have never even heard of a condom in any form to begin with, we feel that a plug on her show could spark a major surge in our sales."" Public-relations executives from Trojan, Sheik and 'Phragmtastic! are also aggressively lobbying for selection by Winfrey's club. With Winfrey's latest crusade another unqualified success, even the most skeptical concede that her power to get TV viewers to unflinchingly do whatever she tells them is virtually limitless. Among Winfrey's future ventures: an ""Eating With A Knife And Fork Club""; a ""Not Throwing Things On The Floor Club""; and, perhaps most ambitious of all, a Breathing With Your Mouth Closed instructional videotape.","entertainment, television, news, vol 32 issue 01, entertainment"

3965,The Black Men Was A Black Time At The Movies,"It has been said that there is no better time to see movies than during the summer time. Back when the world was young and long before the Great War, they made good movies all year round. But now they only make movies for us to go and see and for me to review during the months of the summer season. These movies are called blockbuster movies, I suppose because people would bust their blocks in order to see them. But I did not want to bust my block to see the new movie called The Black Men starring Mr. Tommy Jones and his young colored sidekick, Will Barnaby. Why do they no longer allow a man to smoke a fine cigar at the pictures? I think that a time spent in the bijou should be a time of relaxation, and I know of no better way to relax than with a fine cigar like the ones rolled by the young ladies of Cuba who are Cuban ladies who take their pants down and roll the cigars with their legs like they did before the devil man Fidle Castor took over the country and John Fitzgerald Kennedy (our president) told us that we could no longer buy cigars from the Cuba country which is located, I believe, somewhere south of the Florida state in the great American Southwest. Hello to everyone in Florida! I appreciate the oranges and sunlight provided by you when you go to work for the greater good of the country, unlike the lad who works at Hardee's in my neighborhood and who so often forgets that I am partial to catsup. I called my editor, Steve, and asked him if he would like for me to give him my two cents on the new Black Men movie, which was recently released with much fanfare, judging from the commercials I have read. But my editor, Steve, told me that he would not like for me to review that movie but if I wanted to I could review a taped videotape of an old Gene Autry movie because he knows that I am from the old days of Hollywood, when Gene Autry used to spin his guns like periscopes and shoot the villains of the Old West. Now those were movies! So I had to go see the movie called Men Wearing Black by myself, because my editor, Steve, would not pay for a ticket and Toots (my wife of 52 years) told me that I would have to go see the movie by myself because she does not appreciate the art of the film. I do not know why they call the movie I went to review Black Men, because only one of the two men who star in the picture is a black rapping man. Perhaps it is because of the color of their suits, which are black. There are also many space monsters in the movie, including one that is actually a dog. You should see Mr. Jones shake the dog! Toots does not let me smoke cigars because she says it is bad for me and she does not want to be made a widow. So I do not smoke the cigars except for when I play poker with Thomas. But Thomas went on to his Great Reward in 1978, after he contracted a serious cold because his wife forgot to tell him to wear his shoes out in the snow. I decided that when I was at the movies, I would enjoy a fine cigar like I used to when I would attend the theater as a young man. But the people in the theater told me that it was not allowed. What do they know? They cannot even deliver the paper on time. I mean the younger generation, of course, who delivers my paper, but sometimes they forget to deliver the Green Sheet, and I cannot read the funnies, not because I cannot read, but because the funnies are not there, only news from all corners of the globe. And the obituaries. Also in the movie I saw there was a space ship. I lit my cigar at the movies and, my God, you would not believe the ruckus it caused when I lit my cigar. First of all, the lady behind me told me to put out my cigar but I did not pay attention to her because she carried herself as if she were a member of the lower gentry. Then a man told me to put my cigar out. Then another man told me to put my cigar out. Then another man told me to put my cigar out. And then another man told me to put my cigar out. I ask you, where are their manners? Then a young man approached me who identified himself as the manager of the establishment, but he was dressed in the sneakers. I assumed he was giving me guff, so I told him I would not put out my cigar. Then another man told me to put my cigar out. Then the manger said, ""Hey, you, you can't smoke cigars in here!"" and I told him I could and he said I couldn't. And then he said he would call the police, and it was then that I decided I had enough, so I put out my cigar and wrote down his name. The name of the young man who told me I could not smoke a fine cigar in his theater was named Phillip. I told him I would write his name in my column and besmirch his good name, and he said fine, so I am now going to write his name in my movie review. His name is Phillip, and his theater did not treat me with any hospitality like I treat people when they come to visit me and Toots (my wife) but the only person who comes to visit us is my nephew, Kenneth, and he hasn't come for a visit in quite some time. Because he is in college. Go Cougars! Men Black is not a very good movie. I could not relax because I was so worried that my cigar would burn me to bits, even though I put it out. I was worried that it would start my blazer on fire. The movie was about men from the stars, and they looked quite strange in their unusual costumes and with many eyes on their heads. Do not go to see that movie, as it is not very good and I was not allowed to smoke a cigar. The good old days! Those were the days. Until next time, I will see you on the Silver Screen, and I will not try to smoke a cigar anymore in Phillip's theater if he lets me come back some day, but he told me never to come back. But where else does he expect me to see a movie? At the dump? They do not show movies at the dump! Mr. Danielson's column is reprinted with permission of The Butternut Gazette in Butternut, OH.

3966,Entertainment Tonight Acquires Exclusive Preview Footage,"HOLLYWOOD, CA'In an unprecedented act of journalistic subterfuge, Entertainment Tonight has acquired preview footage from the set of the upcoming action film Maximum Heat, giving ET viewers a rare opportunity to see a portion of a film that will not be in theaters until fall. The New Line Cinema release, starring Steven Seagal as an Army Ranger and reformed arsonist who joins forces with the FBI to track down his former criminal mentor, was not intended to be viewed, whole or in part, by the general public until its theatrical release in October. Despite the strict ban, at approximately 7:11 p.m. EST Monday, ET aired the footage, which shows Seagal punching a stuntman and flipping him over his shoulder, then turning around to strike a third performer. Director Joseph Merhi is then heard yelling, ""Cut!"" ET host Mary Hart commented: ""Although Maximum Heat doesn't sizzle onto the big screen until October, we've got an exclusive first look especially for ET viewers."" According to ET producer Gavin Burnhardt, the on-set footage was acquired via secret infiltration of the film's publicity department by veteran ET investigative reporter and former Miss America Leanza Cornett. Cornett used an inside connection at New Line, assistant publicist Stacey Klein, to obtain a special all-access pass to the film's Hollywood set. Then, in what Hollywood insiders are calling an ""ET exclusive,"" Cornett brought a cameraman to the film's set and taped an estimated 10 minutes of never-before-seen, behind-the-scenes footage. Following the taping, Cornett fled on foot, arriving safely at ET's studio several blocks away with the footage intact. During the frantic escape, Cornett also managed to snatch a videotape of the film's trailer and conduct a four-minute interview with Seagal about the direction his film career has taken and how happy he is in his new marriage. ET intends to use both pieces of footage in upcoming episodes. Upon hearing of the covert operation, New Line publicist Dean Schwab said: ""I am shocked and appalled at what ET has done, all in the name of airing scenes from this film. Maximum Heat is intended for viewing in a movie theater, by paying customers. The only mitigating factor I can think of is that this will help promote the film at no cost to us."" Added Schwab: ""On October 19thEE the 'Heat' is on!""he Maximum Heat scoop is considered to be ET's most controversial since last November's exclusive preview of Paramount Pictures' Star Trek: First Contact. Since ET is also produced by Paramount, the matter was dealt with internally and never went to trial. ET co-host Bob Goen defended Cornett's journalistic tactics and praised her for ""her tenacity and bravery."" Said Goen: ""Leanza was absolutely determined to get this story, and, like any good reporter, that's exactly what she did. By the way, I can't wait to see Maximum Heat. It looks fantastic.""nn","entertainment, tv, media, news, vol 31 issue 24, entertainment"

3969,Learning Channel Switches To All-Gilligan Format,"ROSSLYN, VA'In a move considered inevitable by cable-industry insiders, The Learning Channel announced Monday its decision to give up attempts to package educational material for the commercial television market. Beginning July 15, the network will switch over to an ""All-Gilligan"" format. ""To hell with learning,"" said Mark Almond, head of programming for the struggling network at a press conference announcing the changeover. ""I mean, who were we kidding? A commercial station with programming that focuses exclusively on educational topics? Who wants to sit home and watch a bunch of penguins laying eggs or some crap like that? Gee, that should really pull in the ratings."" ""Christ!"" Almond added. ""Who needs it?"" According to a network press release, under TLC's new format, viewers will enjoy 24-hour Gilligan availability. ""Beginning July 15 on The Learning Channel, there will be Gilligan, and the Skipper, too, as well as the millionaire and his wife,"" read the press release for the new format, which is being heavily promoted by TLC with the new catch-phrase, ""Learning? Pfft!"" The format switch is considered the most significant cable-industry retooling since The History Channel adopted its current all-Hitler format in 1994. TLC officials say that many new programming formats were considered by the network before the decision to go all-Gilligan, including: all-Danza, all-psychic, all-Manimal, and all-spandex aerobic crotch thrusting. ""We opted for the Gilligan-centered programming strategy after research indicated that there was no other show'whether sitcom, game show, drama, cartoon, musical-variety, or anything else'that required less intelligence to watch and comprehend,"" vice-president of programming Bob Hile said. Plovis-area nine-year-old Timmy McWimmy, a member of TLC's new target demographic, was pleased with the announcement. ""It's funny how they can't get off the island. When Gilligan tries to get off the island he always messes up, and then they have to stay,"" McWimmy said, moments before spilling a popsicle on himself. Sub-literate pre-teens, however, are not the only demographic group the all-Gilligan format targets. ""The widely varied cast of characters presents us with many opportunities for broad-based market penetration,"" TLC sales director Martin Vogler said. ""The presence of Ginger, the movie star, provides the kind of sex appeal for adult male viewers that our learning-directed programming sorely lacked. Also, the wholesome Mary Ann draws viewership among mothers between 30 and 55; the Howells will attract high-income 55- to 70-year-olds, and the presence of the Professor ensures that there will still be enough science-based content for us to retain our old viewers who might still be interested in learning."" The fact that most Americans have already seen and memorized every episode of the critically panned mid-'60s sitcom is ""of little to no concern,"" TLC executives said. ""Studies show that easy recognizability of deeply ingrained icons plays a greater role in positive viewer response to a program than does the desire to follow an unfamiliar narrative,"" Vogler said.","entertainment, tv, news, vol 31 issue 21, entertainment"

3978,This 'Alan Jackson' Must Be Stopped,"All over this country there is evidence of a takeover. Not a violent, outright takeover, but a far more subtle and insidious one. To do nothing is to accept our demise. I cannot do nothing. This Alan Jackson must be stopped. I have seen the 10-gallon hats and spangled outfits, the tight blue jeans and rhinestone rings that mark the true believers. I have seen What I Am posters in the recordstore windows, and gone eye to empty eye with a man who wears a mustache, but not a beard. I have never been a holy man, but I know what is right and what is wrong. And this is so very, very wrong. If this is not to be our future, every last one of us must take up arms. A belief in Alan Jackson has its attractions. I know only too well the abhorrent effects it can produce. ""She's Got The Rhythm (And I've Got The Blues)"" jingles and jangles right into the wall of your cranium and lodges itself there until you are powerless, swaying down the aisles of Kmart to a 4/4 beat. The scourge of it! I first heard Alan Jackson while sitting in a dentist's waiting room. ""Don't Rock The Jukebox"" crept into my conscious mind as I paged through an issue of Time. I bolted upright. The young man next to me, 22 at most, was transfixed by the music. I looked down at his feet, tapping away, encased in cowboy boots. I cringed as I caught a glimpse of a future where his kind was the norm, a future where all are united under Alan Jackson's banner of rural conformity. This Alan Jackson is supposed to be different and new. Yet it is strangely reminiscent of some ancient evil, some crawling, seething thing that had spawned such devils as Debbie Gibson and Richard Marx. Don't tell me that ""Chattahoochee"" is a harmless, bouncy tribute to the beauty and simplicity of the past. No, this song is something much darker. I do not know what Alan Jackson's evil message is, but I do not trust his messengers. Their very dress is a uniform of evil. Witness how cowboy boots, which seem so innocent, have sharp, wicked points at the front for tearing flesh and thick, clublike heels for crushing bone. Witness how the bolo tie is nothing more than a stylized assassin's garrote. And who knows what malicious instruments may be concealed beneath a 10-gallon hat? And the leader of this band is Alan Jackson, with his mane of hair and sinister white T-shirt. Damn him. Damn him to hell! With his soft ""Yes, ma'am""s and ""No, sir, I don't reckon""s, he charms his way into our hearts. But once there, he will work at us from the inside out. He looks so harmless on the cover of A Lot About Livin' (And A Little 'Bout Love), but lo, he is not. The South cannot be trusted! Like Germany, they were defeated, but bide their time with clandestine plans! As America's easily swayed young farmers dance their joyless, grim-faced line dances, we must ask ourselves: Do we want such suspicious people in charge of feeding our nation? Alan Jackson thinks so. Even as we speak, he is amassing cash to marshal a takeover of our weakened Northern cities. He must be stopped.

3980,Why Didn't Anyone Tell Me Jerry Garcia Was Dead?,"Whoa, dude, shit. This is heavy. This is soEE God, I don't know. Let me tell you, man. I was sitting down with all these people on the sidewalk in front of Beads 'N' More Beads one day last year, just playing the guitar and making bracelets, and everybody was talking about Jerry Garcia. They're all saying he's dead, and I was like, ""de, of course'he is the Dead."" I mean, Phil and Bob and all those other guys, shit, they're just following Jerry's vision. Jerry's the one that hears, like, the voice or whatever it is. You hear ""Box of Rain,"" and you think Jerry, not those other guys, you dig? Anyway, everyone was rollin' up big doobies and passin' them around and saying, ""This one's for Jerry,"" and I thought that was pretty cool. I was leaning back against the building and looking up into the sky, thinking, man, that guy is the fuckin' king, or something. Yeah, he's like a king. Only it isn't like a country that he's the king of. It's like he's king of the music. Then all the chicks there, Fauna and Savannah and the rest of them, all of a sudden they started crying. I didn't really know what was up, but I gave the one in the long peasant dress a big hug and said, ""It's gonna be all right."" She said, ""Yeah,"" and smiled and hugged me back. It was pretty cool. So anyway, that was, like, a whole bunch of months ago, but then yesterday, oh, man, it was so intense. I was playing hacky sack on the grass with Derek and Randy and Pete. We were all barefoot and had a bunch of juggling sticks, and I had a whole quarter with me. We were passing the pipe around, and it was so warm and sunny and there was so much nature everywhere. I was thinking, shit, this is nice. So I say to this guy in a dashiki, I gotta get a new brother to hook me up. The summer's coming soon, and I'm gonna need some serious green stuff. You see, the plan for the summer was to quit my Greenpeace canvassing job, get the van running and drive around to a bunch of Dead shows. But then this guy in one of those Dr. Seuss hats says to me, ""Man, that band ain't nothing without Jerry Garcia. We're driving out to see Phish in Colorado this June, man. Those dudes have inherited the vibes, you know?"" I was shocked. I said, ""What do you mean'Jerry quit the band?"" So the guy with the Seuss hat says, ""No, man. Jerry's dead."" Then I say, ""Well if he's Dead, then he's still with the band."" So then he says, ""No, man, he's dead. He died."" I'd just had some kind bud at my wake and bake, so I was a little bit buzzed, but a couple minutes after he said that, I let out the biggest ""Whoa"" of my 20 years. Jerry's dead? Shit, man.

3981,"C-SPAN Courts Viewers With 'Mr. Slotnik,' Congress' Cantankerous Landlord","WASHINGTON, DC'Citing lackluster ratings in an increasingly competitive cable market, C-SPAN announced Monday that it will beef up the cast of characters on its daily congressional broadcasts with ""Mr. Slotnik,"" a gruff but lovable landlord who owns the Capitol Building where sessions of Congress take place. C-SPAN programmers are hopeful that the cantankerous Slotnik character, played by veteran sitcom actor Norman Fell, will inject a much-needed element of comic relief into the long-running legislative series. ""Many TV viewers are curious about Congress, but simply have no inclination to sit through countless hours of dry, minutiae-filled legislative discussion,"" said C-SPAN vice-president of programming Kenneth Silvers. ""The added comic element of Mr. Slotnik and his humorous outbursts will help viewers stay interested in the lawmaking process. Hopefully, he will also attract TV viewers who just need a laugh, even if they don't care about the U.S. government."" Slotnik made his debut on Friday's broadcast during a debate on a bill to allocate $4 million for the preservation of Florida wetlands. As Sen. Bob Graham (D-FL) was finishing a point about the economic viability of the resolution, Slotnik pounded on the doors to the Senate chamber and shouted, ""Will you keep it down in there!"" He then stormed into the chamber onto the senate floor, where he began arguing with members of the Senate Select Committee On Aging. ""You deadbeat legislators are two months behind on the rent!"" said the cranky, mop-waving Slotnik to the bi-partisan committee of legislators. ""If I don't have that money by Friday, I'll kick your butts so hard you'll taste my shoe polish for a week!"" Slotnik then stormed out, accompanied by canned laughter. C-SPAN programmers are elated by viewers' strong response to Mr. Slotnik. ""Our focus groups consistently rate the new Slotnik character higher than any of the legislators, Senate or House,"" Silvers said. ""And the decision to enhance congressional broadcasts with a laugh track has worked out even better than we had hoped."" Fell says his Slotnik character may seem gruff at first, but deep down he is a lovable softie. ""The role of Slotnik is a complex one for me,"" the former Three's Company star said. ""He seems angry at the congressmen for their non-stop bill-proposing and coalition-building, but underneath it all, he is very proud of his tenants for having been elected to lead America."" Though widely tagged as ""risky"" by TV industry insiders, C-SPAN's decision to add the Slotnik character is already paying off: The network earned its highest ratings in more than a decade for Wednesday's ""hammock"" episode. In the episode, Slotnik, attempting to skip out on the tedious chore of fixing congressional plumbing and catch a nap on the sly, falls out of a hastily constructed hammock numerous times, repeatedly disrupting an important House Standing Agriculture Committee discussion of a proposal to increase federal subsidies to independent farmers. Said committee chair Pat Roberts (R-KS): ""No matter how hard he tried, Slotnik couldn't get a second of rest, as that hammock kept turning over and dumping him on the ground. I laughed so hard, I could barely keep track of which subsidies we were approving and which we weren't!"" While most legislators have not been able to get enough of the irrepressible Slotnik and his antics, some are finding him hard to handle. ""My cake was ruined when Slotnik's hare-brained scheme to finance Medicare by raising and selling rare long-haired goats went awry,"" said Sen. Frank Murkowski (R-AK). ""Now I may never graduate from chef school!"" Sen. Fred Thompson (R-TN) agreed. ""That man is going to drive me bonkers,"" he said. ""I'll never be in position to make a run for president in 2000 if he doesn't stop his incessant meddling. Look at what he did to my good tie!"" Thompson then held up a silk tie full of holes. ""I told Slotnik that his plan to fix the laundry machine himself instead of paying for a professional was a recipe for disaster. But did he listen? Of course not!"" If the strong ratings continue, C-SPAN plans next month to introduce ""Slim,"" the Senate's streetwise, jive-talking sidekick.","entertainment, tv, congress, television, news, vol 31 issue 15, entertainment"
3982,Crash Pulled From Theaters Following Real-Life Car Crash,"OVERLAND PARK, KS'In what highway safety personnel are calling ""a chilling example of cinema come to life,"" David Cronenberg's Crash was pulled from the nation's theaters Monday following an automotive accident near Kansas City which claimed two lives. ""Never before in my 16 years with the highway department have I seen such a thing,"" tow-truck driver Karl Stankiewicz said, surveying the accident site. ""This is like something out of the movies."" According to witnesses, at approximately 11 p.m. Saturday, a Ford Aerostar driven by Chris Gosch, 25, of Kansas City, swerved off a county road at high speed and rolled over, killing Gosch and his girlfriend, passenger Lisa Bradley, 24, instantly. No reason was given for the couple's unorthodox behavior, but U.S. Department of Transportation officials say they will closely study footage from Crash to try to find answers. ""There is a scene in the film in which a pair of lovers swerves off the road in an almost identical fashion to the incident involving Mr. Gosch and Ms. Bradley,"" said Transportation Undersecretary Richard Lathon. ""It's chilling. This really blurs the line between truth and fiction."" Less than 24 hours after learning of the accident, executives from Fine Line Features, distributor of Crash, announced they would pull the film from theaters to prevent any further real-life crashes. ""Crash was meant to be limited to the realm of the imagination, a product of science-fiction writer J.G. Ballard's fertile mind,"" said Fine Line CEO Leo Green, announcing the film's withdrawal. ""We never dreamed this could actually happen. Crash will end its run in theatres as of today."" Despite the studio's apology and withdrawal of the film, Crash director Cronenberg defended his work in an official statement Monday. ""My movie was just that'a movie. It was obviously not intended to be an example of behavior. What happened to Chris Gosch and Lisa Bradley is a tragedy, but it is a tragedy they brought upon themselves because of an inability to discern between fantasy and reality."" In response to fears that ""crashing"" might become popular among impressionable young people who see the movie, Crash stars James Spader and Rosanna Arquette have agreed to collaborate with the National Highway Transportation Safety Bureau on a series of PSAs. The televised spots will feature a sexily dressed Spader and Arquette addressing the camera while engaged in safe driving. Among the slogans to be used in the spots: ""You're On The Street, Not The Screen,"" and ""Remember: In The Real World, Sexy Means Safety First."" Ralph Nader, speaking before a special meeting of the What About The Children? Foundation in San Francisco, said that the entertainment industry must take greater responsibility for the messages it sends out. ""We have come to the point where violence and death have become acceptable forms of entertainment,"" Nader said. ""Impressionable young kids can go to a theater and see a car actually crashing into another car. We shouldn't be surprised when the result is tragedy."" Media watchdog groups find it particularly disturbing that real-life victims Gosch and Bradley were romantically involved, just like the characters in the movie. ""What's more,"" said Royce Gehry, chair of the Arlington, VA-based Media Institute, ""the car they were driving bore an uncanny resemblance to the ones in the film, all the way down to the four-wheel design and the internal combustion engine. Don't tell me this wasn't a 'copycat'-style accident. The similarities are too great to be denied."" If more copycat accidents follow, some lawmakers feel it may be necessary to close all interstate highways until motorists can receive the counseling they need to distinguish between Hollywood action thrills and the real-life dangers of unsafe car ""crashing."" Such a proposal could reach the Senate as early as Thursday. In addition to car accidents, Crash includes numerous scenes of couples having sex. Fortunately, no real-life incidents of sexual contact have thus far been reported. ""We can only hope that people do not engage in sex as a result of Crash,"" Gehry said. ""Sexual encounters belong only in the movies.""","entertainment, movies, news, vol 31 issue 15, entertainment"

3984,Federal Court Orders Cosmopolitan To Reveal Beauty Secrets,"WASHINGTON, DC'Following a federal grand jury injunction Tuesday, the editors of Cosmopolitan have been ordered to turn over classified documents revealing top-level beauty secrets originating deep within the magazine's inner circle. ""The American people have a right to know which apricot scrubs are best for exfoliating the skin and clarifying clogged pores,"" said Fifth Circuit Judge William J. Messersmith after the order was served. ""And if there is a way to eliminate combination skin'wherein the face is oily in the 'T-zone' and dry in the cheeks'such vital, appearance-enhancing information must be made available to all Americans."" In accordance with the court's decision, on May 1, 1997, 10 beauty secrets from Cosmopolitan files will be opened to the public for the first time. Among the carefully guarded secrets to be revealed: the right hairstyle for your facial shape; unleashing those lashes; the truth about anti-residue shampoos; and 10 great avocado masks for under $10. Cosmopolitan lawyers expressed ""great disappointment"" with Monday's decision. ""This represents not only a travesty of justice, but a serious blow to national security,"" said Calvin Burks, chief counsel for the magazine. ""Those secrets are highly sensitive tips and tricks to accentuate a woman's natural features and hide tell-tale signs of aging. If such information were to fall into foreign hands, the balance of global beauty power could shift drastically."" Despite their dissatisfaction, Cosmopolitan officials say the magazine will comply with the court order on all counts except one. ""There is a new, spray-on frizz fighter that can be spritzed onto a brush instead of directly onto the hair itself. If such high-level anti-frizz technology were to reach Europe, American women would lose a crucial foothold in the fight to eliminate flyaway locks."" News of the Cosmopolitan decision sent a chill through the offices of America's top beauty magazines, all of which are placed at serious risk by the ruling. ""It's insanity,"" Mademoiselle managing editor Kimberly Thaler said. ""The French have already successfully tested a pro-vitamin shampoo that penetrates root to tip at a secret base in the South Pacific. And we have reason to believe they've also experimented with botanicals. Giving away such high-level conditioning and moisturizing technology could radically shift the global PH-balance of power."" Added Thaler: ""We may as well tell the Italians whether to use long or short strokes when applying mascara."" Beauty law experts say the Cosmopolitan decision may only be the beginning. ""This is a landmark, precedent-setting case,"" said Harvard University professor of fashion and fitness Thomas Schulke. ""It could open the door for the release of a vast range of information, everything from, 'How to tell if he wants you,' to 'Are you or aren't you a commitmentphobe?'"" Monday's decision represents the final chapter in the landmark, three-year-old Goodwin v. Cosmopolitan suit. In May 1994, Fort Lauderdale, FL, homemaker Karen Goodwin, 32, sued the magazine for eight counts of malfeasance in beauty advisement. At issue were a series of documents which, according to the Goodwin camp, withheld key secrets from Cosmopolitan's January 1994 ""Beauty Blowout"" issue. ""I am finally vindicated,"" said a victorious Goodwin moments after the verdict was announced. ""And so are Esther Rosenman and all the others who gave their lives so that make-up and hair-care tips could someday circulate freely."" Rosenman, a former Glamour staff writer, was tried and hanged in 1952 for selling eye-shadow secrets to the Russians.","entertainment, government, media, news, vol 31 issue 14, entertainment"
3985,High-Definition Television Promises Sharper Crap,"WASHINGTON, DC'In the most dramatic leap in television technology since the advent of color in the 1950s, on Monday the FCC approved a 10-year plan to shift to digital, high-definition TV, technology which will make barely watchable crap far sharper and more detailed than ever before. ""This is a monumental breakthrough,"" said Magnavox vice-president Gene Kalman, demonstrating a prototype of the new HDTV. ""This atrocious episode of Sliders almost looks like it will leap off the screen, and it wasn't even shot in the new format."" The first generation of the format, Sony's ""TV-H,"" will be available in U.S. stores as early as this fall. Though the $2,500 price tag makes crystal-clear viewing of intelligence-insulting swill possible only for the very well-off, prices are expected to drop dramatically in the next five years. ""By the year 2005,"" said Bob Rowell, president of the American Association of Broadcasters, ""90 percent of American homes will watch their favorite mind-numbing swill on a high-definition TV."" ""Soon, your children will be able to watch shrill, grating Hanna-Barbera re-runs on the Cartoon Network with a degree of crispness unheard of when you first watched that crap in the '70s,"" Rowell said. ""And those whose lives are so empty that each Thursday night they actually watch all of NBC's so-called 'Must-See-TV' lineup will be amazed at the clarity and resolution with which all those stupid people's apartments come through."" Promised Rowell: ""When you see the episode of Martin in which the computer dating service matches Martin up with his neighbor Sheneneh, his grotesque and profoundly unfunny mugging will come through with a resolution unimagined on traditional TVs."" Stupid, inane commericals will also look amazingly deep and dimensional when viewed in the new format. The digital sound system will also greatly enhance their intrusive, overloud quality. ""That kid with the Southern accent on the grape-juice ad will look like you can almost reach out and strangle him,"" Rowell said. In addition, recent big-budget movies like Independence Day and Eraser will soon be available in HDTV digital-cassette format, which manufacturers promise will offer an experience comparable to shaking your head and thinking, ""This sucks,"" in an actual movie theater. Top videogame manufacturers, including Nintendo and Sega, are already developing new systems on which consumers will be able to play astonishingly crisp, ultra-realistic versions of the same old stupid videogame in which two guys pound the shit out of each other. Designed with an eye to the future, HDTVs will be also able to accomodate yet-to-be-unveiled cable-TV systems, which promise to bring more than 1,000 channels of unwatchable tripe into the home. ""We have seen the future,"" FCC chair Reed Hundt said, ""and it is sharp. And it is crap.""","entertainment, tv, television, news, vol 31 issue 13, entertainment"

3991,Fox Defends Airing Of When Jews Attack,"LOS ANGELES'In the face of widespread public outcry, Fox TV executives spoke out Monday in defense of last week's airing of When Jews Attack. The hour-long, Robert Urich-hosted show'which its detractors are decrying as ""shock TV at its basest"" and ""a sickening appeal to voyeuristic, lowest-common denominator tendencies""'features explicit, uncensored video footage of enraged Jews violently striking out at others. ""For the next hour, what you will see you may find disturbing, even shocking,"" Urich said during the show's introduction. ""But remember: The footage you are about to see is real."" Fox owner Rupert Murdoch defended his network's decision to air the controversial show. ""This disturbing imagery may be difficult for some to watch,"" he said. ""But we feel that the public has a right to see these attacks. They really do happen."" Among the show's objectionable segments: videotaped footage of a sudden, brutal attack by New Rochelle, NY, dentist Richard Rosenblatt on an unsuspecting dry cleaner. As the tape shows, tension mounted as Rosenblatt, after waiting in line more than 25 minutes to pick up his clothes at Sunrise Cleaners, became involved in a prolonged argument with dry cleaner Arthur Tong over what he described as ""too much starch"" in his laundry. When Tong denied that the clothes were overstarched, Rosenblatt suddenly leapt over the countertop and, without warning, began maniacally slapping the dry cleaner about the face and chest. ""It was frightening,"" Tong said, recalling the attack in a taped interview segment on the show. ""Of course, I'd seen people being slapped by Jews on television, but you never think it'll happen to you."" Program detractors are also objecting to a segment which aired toward the end of the show, in which Chicago-area shopper Andrea Stein, complaining that ""these are not the shoes I ordered,"" struck Payless Shoes employee Lisette Nolan in the forehead with a pair of tan leather pumps. Stein then pulled Nolan's hair until four other employees were finally able to pull her away. ""Children should not be exposed to such violent footage,"" said Sharon Blaine, head of the San Francisco-based What About The Children? organization. ""In this day and age, we should be above such trash TV."" ""I do not want my child to feel that it is acceptable to resort to hitting, kicking and pinching her siblings, like the Jews she sees on television,"" concerned parent Sandra Hueber said. While most of the program's critics are condemning its offensive content, others are objecting to the message it may send the nation's Jews. ""I fear that the televised glamorization of such attacks may wind up provoking America's already-volatile Jewish population into committing further acts of battery,"" said Anthony Rasmussen, director of the American Center For Media Studies. In reaction to the show, Jewish groups are calling for a boycott of Fox. ""As a Jew, I am deeply offended by this program,"" said B'nai B'rith International president Milton Feig during a press conference to announce the boycott. ""We must send a clear message to Fox that this sort of garbage will not be tolerated."" He then flew into a berserk rage, hurling ceramic vases at reporters and swinging a folding chair wildly. Footage of Feig's attack is scheduled to air April 8, in a second installment of the show.","entertainment, religion, tv, news, vol 31 issue 10, entertainment"

3994,Leno Begs Simpson To Kill Again,"BURBANK, CA'In an impassioned, nationally televised plea Monday, a teary-eyed Jay Leno begged O.J. Simpson to commit more murders. ""I beg of you, Mr. Simpson. I have no more material since your trial ended,"" the Tonight Show host said. ""If you have any decency, any compassion at all, hear my plea to kill someone else."" ""I am certain,"" Leno continued, ""that last month's civil judgment was financially ruinous to you. No doubt, you feel a profound sense of anger over the verdict. That is why today I am urging you to translate that anger into action, violent action against an innocent victim, preferably a celebrity."" In the event that Simpson is unwilling to commit another murder, Leno asked that, at the very least, he sexually brutalize someone. ""For 30 years, The Tonight Show has been America's premier comedic institution. But now, that great tradition is in jeopardy. O.J., America needs another high-profile homicide to show us how to laugh again."" When pressed to name a person for Simpson to murder, Leno suggested an ex-girlfriend. ""That would certainly provide a gold mine for us to work with. Perhaps you could slash her throat, and I then could remark, 'Boy, O.J.'s been slashing so much lately, I hear Kmart's looking to hire him.'"" ""Because they slash a lot of prices,"" he added. Upon the joke's completion, Tonight Show bandleader Kevin Eubanks, at Leno's side for the press conference, slapped his guitar and chuckled good-naturedly. Leno, who built years of monologue material on the premise that Simpson actually committed the murders, was adamant in his plea. ""I am not asking for a methodical, time-consuming, difficult murder. Please, just a clumsy, poorly planned crime of passion like last time."" Upon completion of his remarks, Leno concluded the press conference with a surprise appearance by the Dancing Itos, an outrageous can-can line comprised of Judge Lance Ito lookalikes. The Tonight Show host's impassioned plea to Simpson has been well received by other talk-show hosts. ""I too pray that O.J. Simpson will kill again,"" fellow NBC late-nighter Conan O'Brien said.

""I'm really excited about the marketing possibilities for this enormous heap of worthless crap,"" said Hill. ""There's a lot of buzz in Hollywood about it. Confidentially, Paramount has expressed interest. I think crap is going to be big in '97, and this promises to be some of the best crap yet. It's really fresh and exciting stuff.""

3996,Members Of U2 To Stare In Different Directions,"DUBLIN'In what many record- industry insiders are calling a return to the band's mid-'80s prime, members of U2 announced Monday plans to stare in different directions. Guitarist The Edge said he will stand slightly behind lead singer Bono and stare off to his right, as if gazing purposefully into an uncertain, yet hopeful, future. Bassist Adam Clayton will stare downward, burdened by the weight of injustices all over the world. Drummer Larry Mullen Jr. will look up, as if searching for guidance from a higher power. Lead singer Bono has still not committed to a specific position, saying, ""That is a decision I can only make in the actual moment of artistic creation. But it'll be a different direction than the other three, you can count on that, brother!"" The multi-directional staring is expected to take place atop a jagged, rocky peak.","entertainment, news in brief, vol 31 issue 07, entertainment"

3999,"The Great Star Wars Nearly Made Me Deaf, Because It Was So Loud","Blockbusters! They are the movies that do so good that the people who make them are happy they made them because plenty of families go to see them, and they spend their money at the movies. There haven't been many blockbusters throughout the history of the movies except for Gone In The Wind, which was made in the classic times. It was a blockbuster movie about the War of the Slaves. Because once men owned other men, and they made them work without pay in the hot sun until the night would come and the slaves would sing ""Follow the Drinking Gourd"" and jump over a fence to elude the hounds and go to the North where men were free! I also saw a picture on the television once about that, and it was called The Jeffersons. I like movies with men of color in them, because it is said that this is a month for celebrating my black heritage. But there has never been another blockbuster feature film movie like the film called The Great Star Wars. This is a movie about some people who sail to the stars as if it were an ocean. Can you imagine that! And I assume their space-faring ships were powered by The Atom. Some of the men are black and some of them are white, but they are only black and white because they wear costumes that make them black or white, and underneath the costumes, they are all as white as the day is long. And the fellow who wore black is a dastardly ro-bot man who talked as if he were living in a fish tank, or had a bucket over his head. What kind of bucket? Well, that is for the viewer to decide, I suppose, but to me it sounded like a bucket that once held some spackle. The people who wore white were good people. And the man who wore black was a bad person. Except there were some white ro-bots who shot several people stone dead with ray pistols for no good reason, and I do not approve of the killing. There was also a part in this movie where the ro-bot's head blew sky-high, so the fellow had to purchase a different ro-bot from the midgets. But I am getting ahead of myself! Me and my wife, Toots, went to see the blockbuster movie entertainment which is called The Star Wars. But, my God, the line we had to wait in! We arrived at the film and had to stand for several minutes. My shins began to ache (these days, the blood does not flow into my legs because my legs do not let the blood flow correctly, ever since I wore socks to work all the time, and my doctor told me to stop wearing such tight socks and drawers, but it was too late), so I told the boy in front of me to let me go before him, but the boy in front of me was wearing a shirt that said The Great Star Wars on it. And he told me I could not go in front of him in the line. I would have taken him to task for his disrespectful attitude, but the boy had a sword which looked to be made of glowing plastic. And when he waved it at me it chilled the cockles of my heart. So Toots (my wife) and I decided to go home. That young man couldn't have been any older than 27! But then we decided to go back the next night and see the movie called The Great Star Wars. But that was on Sunday, and because I do my walking on Sunday I didn't finish my walking until late, and then Toots cooked me a ham with cloves and by the time we finished eating it was 7:31. Or maybe it was 7:32. But when we got to the mall to view the film product there was no line, which made me happy, but then I was filled with sadness because the man who worked at the theater told me that there were no more tickets to be sold, because everyone was already inside watching The Great Star Wars. Then the boy told us we could buy tickets to see the film we wanted to see, but he said we would have to wait three days because the film was all sold out for three days. So I bought some tickets and smiled and said, ""Thank you for selling me these tickets, because it is hard to buy tickets and wait in line for this movie."" And the boy thanked me and I was on my way. Then I went home, and then I came back to get Toots because I forgot her because she had gone to look in a shop for some clown sculptures. She is going to spend me out of house and home! Women love the shopping, that is for sure. Then at last the day came to use the tickets I had purchased to see The Great Star Wars, which I wanted to see so that I could review it for you. But I fell asleep in my chair watching a television program entitled The NBC News Program. And when I woke up I forgot to see the movie. I was busy fixing a birdhouse. The squirrels are eating all the bird food. I do not remember what happened on The News Program on NBC. Four days later, me and Toots finally got to see The Great Star Wars. We went to the movie, and the line had only 25 people in it. Well, actually, there were many more than 25, but I stopped counting at the number 25 because it was making me weary. But we saw the movie. It was a loud movie. And I have already told you what it was about. The Great Star Wars was not too good. I was in The Great War, and it was near to the 44th parameter when I first heard the whistling noise. And the next thing I knew, I was in the medical tent and I had some metal in my head. Ever since then, I have not been able to tie my shoes correctly. Except some times I can. There was a princess in the movie and she was good-looking, except that she pushed the men around. Not in my day! But that was a long time ago in a place far away. And there were several creatures who looked to be from the land of fantasy. Because they were like no creatures I have ever seen, except in the days when I enjoyed the drink. I read an article in one of my periodicals which stated that The Great Star Wars made much money because many people paid to see it. So if you already saw it, you didn't need to read my review, and I am sorry if I have wasted your time today. But next time, I will try to see a movie that you have never seen, so that I can tell you not to see it before you see it. Because that is my job as a film critic. You do not need a film education to be a film critic, you just need to love the movies. Hollywood! Where dreams come true for some, and for others they are dashed on the boulevard of discarded memories. Some are famous, some are not. But they all have high hopes of making it in show business. And there was also a character in the movie who looked like a giant bear man, but he carried a rifle and screamed like my old man when he came home from a bender. Well, until next time, save me a seat on the Silver Screen. Mr. Danielson's column is reprinted with permission of The Butternut Gazette in Butternut, OH.

4000,Larry Flynt Has Sex With Own Mother In Outhouse,"KNOB CREEK, KY'In an incident that has shocked and repulsed even the most fervent free-expression advocates, controversial Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt had sexual intercourse with his own mother in an outhouse Monday. According to reports, not only did Flynt place his mother ""face-first in an outhouse shit-hole"" near Flynt's poverty-stricken, white trash, backwoods place of birth before ""taking her from behind like a dog,"" but he was also surrounded by pigs, sheep, convicted felons, born-again evangelists, Mafia-linked magazine distributors, and a huge-phallused caricature of Santa Claus at the time. Particularly nauseating, sources say, was the fact that during the incestuous act, Flynt's colostomy bag exploded violently, covering Flynt, his mother, and all onlookers in a torrential shower of his own feces. Flynt, who is described by close friends and colleagues as a ""perverted bastard,"" does not possess control over his own bowels. The liaison, which is said to have been possibly the single most obscene and degrading act in human history, has left everyone from right-wing Christian leaders to ACLU lawyers to Larry Flynt himself condemning the sickening, depraved display. ""I cannot in good conscience allow myself to continue this sick, hideous abomination against all that is decent,"" Flynt said shortly after completion of the sexual liaison. ""Our nation's children must be protected from filth like myself!"" Flynt added that videos of the event are available for $29.95 from Larry Flynt Publications, Inc. Though confined to a wheelchair after being paralyzed by an assailant's bullet during a Georgia obscenity trial in 1978, Flynt, who can feel no sensation beneath the waist, was able to achieve erection and sexually penetrate his 81-year-old mother, Dolores Flynt. His success was largely due to a special penile implant that allows him to partially imitate the mechanics of sexual intercourse in a grotesque parody of the act of human love. ""If the Constitution will protect me, then it will protect all of you, because I'm the worst,"" Flynt said. ""But this time, I've gone too far. I swear to God, I'll sue the pants off myself for doing this to Mama, even if I have to chase myself all the way to the Supreme Court."" ACLU lawyer Dan Glickman agreed with Flynt. ""The right of all Americans to free expression, no matter how offensive that expression may seem to others, is the cornerstone of the liberties we as a nation hold as our highest principles,"" Glickman said. ""Nonetheless, I think we should fry that sick Larry Flynt bastard."" In the wake of the incident, Flynt held a special prayer service Tuesday at his Los Angeles-area mansion. ""And now, let us lower our heads in silent prayer,"" Flynt, hands folded, told the assembled crowd. ""Sweet Jesus in heaven, hallelujah. Praised be our Savior on high. Christ, we beseech you in Your Father's name, save us all, in Your mercy, from me, Larry Flynt, a sick, disgusting, crippled, drug-addled, perverted, fat, shit-covered pig of a man who would just as soon vomit in Your Most Holy face as listen to this sanctimonious, hypocritical bullshit a minute longer. Holy shit, there I go again, Lord!"" Flynt's mother was unavailable for comment at press time, as she was posing for a pictorial in her son's magazine.","entertainment, celebrities, news, vol 31 issue 04, entertainment"

""This is the movie everybody's talking about,"" Goen said, reading from a studio teleprompter to ET's national television audience. ""The buzz around Hollywood is that the special effects are out of this world,"" he added. Goen reportedly spent much of Sunday afternoon studying the publicity packet for the film. Goen's boss, Paramount Pictures executive Ira Niven, said he believes the film will be ""a real treat"" for Goen. Paramount publicity head Ellyn Clark said she expects Goen to ""absolutely love"" the film.","entertainment, news in brief, vol 31 issue 04, entertainment"
4002,Mothership Accidentally Descends On Hootie Concert,"ROSEMONT, IL'Confusion and awkwardness resulted Monday when the P-Funk Mothership, outer-space chariot of Dr. Funkenstein and the Star Child, accidentally descended upon a sold-out Hootie and the Blowfish concert at the Rosemont Horizon arena in suburban Chicago. ""Thumpasaurus Peoples! You have summoned us through the Groove, and we have returned to refunkatize the planet!"" said Dr. Funkenstein, the fur-bedecked, disco-booted Mothership Supreme Commander, moments before the popular South Carolina-based band was about to launch into the song ""I Only Wanna Be With You."" Members of Hootie and the Blowfish, whose 1995 release Cracked Rear View sold over 14 million copies, were caught off guard by the arrival of the Mothership. ""The man who came out of the spaceship attempted to shoot me with something he called a 'Bop Gun,'"" lead singer Darius Rucker told reporters. ""Somehow I sensed it would be detrimental to my career as a singer."" Added a visibly distressed Rucker: ""He also seemed to imply that if I let my mind go free, something would happen to my bottom."" Bandmate Dean Felber was equally disturbed by the appearance of the cosmic visitors. ""Their mode of dress was, frankly, garish,"" Felber told reporters, ""not at all like the muted, earth-tone flannels and oversized cable-knit sweaters appropriate for concert wear."" Sources speculate that an inadvertent hip shake by Rucker, who briefly lost his balance stumbling over a stray mandolin, may have accidentally summoned the Mothership. It is also speculated that Rucker's powerful baritone voice may have exceeded Hootie and the Blowfish's normal safety standards for ""bass,"" inadvertently summoning the intergalactic funk saucer. Said band member Mark Bryan,""We had just finished a really super rendition of 'Let Her Cry' that sounded exactly like on the CD, when out of nowhere these strange men came down shouting about getting up and doing the backstroke, or something."" According to police, no serious damage was caused by the incident, but it did result in a 45-minute concert delay, causing many in attendance to go to bed later than they had wanted to. ""I had a 9 a.m. meeting the next day with a very important client,"" said concertgoer/stockbroker James Norridge, 42, who did not go to sleep until well after midnight. ""I really needed to be at the top of my game."" Norridge's disappointment was typical of the 17,456 whites in attendance. ""I did not wish to get 'funked up,'"" said Roger Kleist, 33. ""If I did, I would have attended a Dave Matthews Band concert.""","entertainment, music, news, vol 31 issue 04, entertainment"

""I've always been bothered by a couple of the scenes, and I've really wanted to redo them using some of the new technology,"" Redford said. ""For instance, in the scene where the Timothy Hutton character first confronts his mother about the older son's death, you can see certain imperfections in the space battle going on in the background.""

4004,Evita Is A Dance Of A Good Time,"Hello and welcome back to my newspaper column entitled ""The Silver Screen."" As you may recall, in my newspaper column I often will tell you about which movies will put the brass in your buttons and which of the motion picture entertainments are not worth an old shoe's worth of nickels. But here today I will talk about a movie called Evitas which is a movie about a lady in the foreign country of South America, and she is the leader of this country and the country goes to war with the Turks or something. I do not approve of the Turks, as they are an unruly race of tinkers and layabouts who would just as soon kill you as cook you dinner. And who can forget the Battle of Trafalgar, made famous in song and story and in history books, when Our Fighting Men were pinned down at the beach by the exploding shells of the Turks and their muskets before the boys were able to sail back home to Circular Key, and all their legs and arms had been blown off and they now only had stumps? Except maybe in Evitas it wasn't the Turks who they were at war with. In fact, I am confusing Evita with another movie. I was in the Great War. The only true friends are those friends made in war, it is said! Evitas is a movie currently playing which stars an up-an-coming ingenue who has taken the name of Manodda. I do not know why she calls herself that. If I had a daughter I would give her a better name than that, and if she changed her name to Manodda she would taste my belt! But I do not have any children. My wife, Toots, used to say that a house full of children is a happy home, but I did not agree with her because at that time in my life I was not thinking clearly because I had just returned from the Great War, and I had seen enough killing and the last thing I wanted to see was the miracle of birth. But now I realize I was crazy and under the spell of the drink. Evitas also stars a young Spaniard named Tony Bandelerro who is a fine actor, though in this particular film (Evitas) he was too swarthy for my tastes. I much prefer a good Bowery Boys serial to the movies they make today. Back in the days of Hollywood, before they started making all the movies, they only made a few movies but they were better movies than the movies they make today, except for Regarding Henry, which was a fine film. Regarding Henry was about a man who goes and gets himself shot in the stamper. And the Bowery Boys would always solve the crimes and give back to their community. Such ideals are rarely found in today's youth, who sit on my grass and play jacks, even though I have told them time and time again not to sit on my front lawn and play jacks because I have spent a long time cutting my lawn and they should go home for dinner, anyway. There was one scene in Evitas in which Mr. Bandelerro started singing for no apparent reason. Then he jumped through a window, and something blew up and hurt my ears. I do not know why they cannot turn down the volume in the bijous. When I am looking at the television machine at home, I can hear just fine, so why do they need to set my head ringing? I pay money for the movies, so I should not have to go deaf at the movies! That is what I always say! Give me the olden times, when old Mrs. Walterhominy would set her hands to an organ and play such musical accompaniment to the pictures that we would all stop throwing our penny whistles and licorice pipes. I was a young sprout in those days, and in those days, believe it or not, they did not even have words in movies because they hadn't yet figured out how to capture voices on records like they do today. I remember one movie called The Robber Of Arabia, which starred the greatest actor of all time, Mr. Douglas Fairberry III. He would ride in on his flying carpet and the ladies would just about fall out of their seats because they were overcome with the vapors at the sight of him. But Mr. Fairberry never said a word. I believe this was because the sound hadn't been invented yet, as I have already explained. If you do not believe me you can go to the library and look it up. But be quiet because the library is a reverent institution. Many people in the movie Evitas enjoyed singing. The best song in the film is one entitled ""Don't Cry For Me, Darling Tina,"" though it was never made clear who Tina is. In fact, many things in this film were not very clear to me. I do not know why everyone was fighting, and I do not know why everyone was singing, and I do not know why everyone was having the sex. There was no excuse for the amount of lewd behavior! They should start putting ratings on movies, like they do on television, so decent people like myself and my wife, Toots, will not have to be exposed to such balderdash. Toots and I walked out halfway through the movie, and we asked for our money back but the young man who ran the theater told me to jump in the lake. There are no lakes near our home in Butternut, OH, though there is a ravine which occasionally beomes flooded during the rainy season. The rainy season now runs from spring to fall, except when I was younger it also rained in the winter once. I do not need to tell you, that was a cold rain! Then one time it rained soot, but it turned out that was because the rendering plant made a mistake and forgot to close a flue and the town stunk for days. I think that was in 1944, although it may have been in 1943, because it was right around the new year. In any case, Happy New Year! May 1997 prove to be a fruitful year for you and your family, as old man time goes out the door and the baby comes in carrying an hourglass and wearing a top hat. And the baby is wearing a fine sash which reads, ""1997."" Now I will review the movie I saw called Evitas. I saw this movie because my editor, Steve, thought that I would enjoy to see a musical. But Evitas was not a musical so much as a movie with lots of songs in it. And I went to see the movie, and this time I told the man at the door my name and the man let me see the movie for free because my editor, Steve, had called ahead, and as a movie critic I am allowed to see the pictures for free, but this was the first time when it actually worked, so I was happy to not pay money for the movie Evitas, which I saw. Evitas was a pretty good movie, though I do not know what the title means. If I were to make this picture, I would have called it The South American Lady. Because that is what it is about. Evitas also had some scenes with tanks and men who wore unusual pants. But we had to leave because of all the sexual parts. So I left with my wife, Toots, and we went home and watched a show called Townies. It was a good program about three ladies who lived in a town, and they were friends, and they worked in a restaurant that served a lot of chowder, because it is a fishing village. If you ask me, Townies is the best television program on the television today. I hope I can remember to watch it next week. I will tell Toots to remind me to watch it, unless I am taking a nap in which case I would rather not be disturbed. Well, until next time, I'll see you on the Silver Screen.

4006,ABC Cancels Yeltsin!,"LOS ANGELES'ABC announced Monday that it is cancelling Yeltsin!, the struggling two-year-old sitcom starring Russian president Boris Yeltsin. Though network executives did not give a reason for the cancellation, it is believed that Yeltsin's poor comedic skills'including his oafish, mistimed delivery of his character's catchphrase, ""You got that right, sister!""'were to blame. Writers for the show were also frustrated by the star's frequent comas, which made it ""nearly impossible"" for the Russian premier to memorize his lines. ""Sooner or later,"" Entertainment Weekly television critic Owen McCready said, ""the stress of doing 26 shows a year portraying a divorced father of three who moves to Pittsburgh to start a new life, in addition to having to lead Russia, was bound to take its toll."" Yeltsin!, which also stars comedian Mark Curry and former 227 star Jackée, debuted in September 1995, touted by ABC as the cornerstone of its much-hyped Tuesday-night line-up. Though the show's debut episode finished third in the Nielsens, it has since slipped dramatically, tying for 54th this past week with CBS's Everybody Loves Raymond. Until a replacement show can be found, Yeltsin!'s 8:30 time slot will be filled with classic episodes of Madam's Place, the irreverent early-'80s comedy featuring the bawdy humor of wise-cracking puppet Madam and a supporting cast that includes sexy redhead Judy Landers as Madam's comely niece. Yeltsin! producers were surprised that the show's ratings continued to drop this season, in light of the September 1996 addition of Bosnian leader Slobodan Milosevic to the cast. ""We thought, if the public isn't responding to a Russian political leader in a light-comedy setting, why not 'up the ante,' so to speak, by giving them a Bosnian one as well,"" executive producer Barbara Baum said. ""Apparently, though, the addition of Milosevic to the show's already-impressive supporting cast was a case of 'too little, too late.' It's sad when you put your all into a project, only to see it end like this."" Many television industry insiders say the writing was on the wall for Yeltsin! in April 1996, when the star mysteriously disappeared for several weeks, with an explanation written into the show's scripts that he had ""just gone down to the store for a loaf of bread."" Yeltsin's ballyhooed return came in the May 3 episode, in which he walked into the apartment carrying several bags of loaves, exclaiming, ""Whew! Now that's a lot of bread, you got that right, sister!"" to resounding applause from the studio audience. Many observers, however, felt that the show's producers had not adequately explained his absence from the storyline and suspected them of trying to hide a more serious problem with the program's ailing star. Baum denies this. ""There's no truth to the rumor that Boris was unable to fulfill his television obligations due to a series of top-secret surgeries to remove eaten stage props from his stomach,"" she said. ""The tabloids love that kind of stuff, and I'm sure it sells papers, but it's just not true."" Baum also denied persistent rumors that Yeltsin is involved romantically with Alyssa Milano, his co-star in the 1995 made-for-TV movie Exchange Student 2: Junior Year Abroad. Yeltsin himself remains optimistic, both about his show-business future and the future of Russia. In a videotaped message from his oxygen-tented sickbed near Gdansk, Yeltsin smiled warmly to reporters, saying, ""I hope my fans will all tune in to see me, TV's Yeltsin, in my upcoming role as host of Sightings on the Sci-Fi Channel, debuting in March. The future of Russia has never looked better, and her people have never been stronger or happier. I am strong as an ox. There will be no need for any coup or other governmental overthrow.

4010,,"Let me tell you this, my friend: The Green Bay Packers rule! Brett Favre, Reggie White and the boys are going all the way this year. The Green and Gold are gonna take it all the way to the Big Dance in New Orleans this January, no doubt about it! That's right'we're gonna ride the cannon arm of a certain quarterback all the way to Super Bowl XXXI! Unlike Dallas or San Fran or any other pussy-ass team, the Pack is led by the Man With The Plan, the 1995 NFL MVP, number four from Kiln, MS, the Golden Boy himself, Mr. Brett Favre! Who do you guys have? Troy Aikman? Elvis Grbac? Please! I know there's people who say the Packers can't get it done 'cause they're a small-town team. But don't you see? That's what makes them so great! They're way up there in Northern Wisconsin, taking on all comers in the name of us small-town folks who might not be from New York or Chicago or Los Angeles but who can still whip some major tail when the game is on the line. They say we don't have a ground game, but I know a certain number 34, Edgar Bennett, who just might beg to differ. They say all of our receivers are hurt, but who cares? Favre's so good he doesn't need receivers! They said we were in trouble after Sterling Sharpe left. Now, it's like, Sterling who? Plus, I'll tell you something else: We've got God on our side, courtesy of The Minister Of Defense, Mr. Reggie White! With Reggie on our side, those other teams don't have a prayer. The Cowboys may say they're America's Team'which is bullcrap, anyway'but we're God's team! For over 75 years the Packers have been kicking ass and taking names. And their fans know it. There's nothing in this life that compares to relaxing with a Schlitz and a sausage sandwich and watching the Pack kick the Bears' asses all over the field. It's like I say: It doesn't get any better than this! The Pack has been around longer than the Bears, who have been around a long time, and that's the reason, as the saying goes, ""The Vikings suck, but the Bears swallow!"" Because we've got a history. Wisconsin is Packer Country! The Packers don't just play football'they live it! And if the big-city slickers have anything to say about it, I'm right here. And so's the Pack! C'mon over and let's rock and roll! The Pack is back in '96! My people are a conquered people, with no future and a lost past. Our land has been taken from us, our culture denied, our ancestors murdered and erased from all history books. We are forced to live in squalor on dusty reservations, helpless as our children descend deeper into our pit of alcoholism and depression. Once we roamed this land freely from ocean to ocean, content to live simply, hunting the plains and fishing the great waters the way we had since the beginning of time. We were happy in our way, happy to live and die as a small part of our world. Yet our holiest traditions have been defiled and degraded. Our sacred places have been stripped of their beauty and befouled by the pollution and waste of our captors. Great Spirit, where have you gone? Once, when this land was beautiful, you honored us with the benevolence of your bounty. Now, all that remains are tattered fragments and shards, littering the despoiled fields of a ruined countryside. Five centuries of trickery, deceit, religious oppression, rape, murder and genocide have left us a tattered, faded people. We grind out what little we can on our barren, dusty reservations by selling beads and trinkets, whoring our heritage by dressing in feathers and skins and hopping like fools for the amusement of the very people who enslave us. In return we receive a few meager dollars, which we quickly spend on alcohol. Though my ancestors once felled the mightiest of stags with only the hand-hewn weapons of ancient wisdom and tradition, the white men took away their power with their guns, stripping them of their dignity, leaving only the hollow shell and withered husk of what once was. Just as the dead oak rots from within until the trunk splits with the softest wind, so has the soul of my people been slowly weakened and decayed. We are as the dust, no more alive than the bison and passenger pigeon, driven from this place by those who killed as they came. Once I dreamed of rising up and reclaiming my past, but a dream is all it will ever be. History will remember us as a people shepherded to extinction by our conqueror's murderous guile. We will never break free of the bottle, the reservation and our new, ever-growing heritage: that of defeat and despair.","entertainment, super bowl, 50 states, point/counterpoint, vol 30 issue 17, chad durbanski, russell whitecloud, entertainment"
4011,New Old People Magazine Gives Old People Something To Read While Waiting To Die,"The tedious pre-death ""waiting period"" endured by still-alive senior citizens became slightly less boring Tuesday, with the introduction of Old People magazine. Published by SeniorBeat Press, the periodical has been designed, according to creator Hal Gurnstein, with one goal in mind: to give the elderly something to read while waiting for death. ""People in this country talk a lot about doing something for the elderly,"" Gurnstein, 31, said. ""Well, here at Old People magazine, we're not just talking about it. We're doing something about it, tackling head-on the two most important issues facing old people today'namely, boredom, and the fact that they haven't died yet."" Old People, the first issue of which hit newsstands with its first issue Tuesday, features an oversized format with words printed in gigantic typeface large enough for even the oldest of the old to see clearly. Featuring very large color pictures as well as special ""I-Can-Read-It-All-By-Myself"" stories'which contain no big words'the magazine's diverting, old-people-pleasing content is expected to provide the elderly with a fun and non-threatening experience. Boasts Gurnstein, ""This magazine will keep old people occupied for hours in silent reading fun."" The first issue of Old People features a photo essay on Franklin D. Roosevelt, as well as articles on the post office, the late Bob Hope, and how pills are dissolved into applesauce in order to make them easier to swallow. Most of the content in the new magazine, however, will focus on the subject of most interest to old people: dying. ""Myrtle's Story,"" an example of the short fiction included, reads in part: ""Myrtle was old. Very old. She waited and waited. Finally, she died."" According to Gurnstein, stories like this one have an important message of hope for the aged. ""This story says to old people, 'All this waiting is not for nothing. Sooner or later, no matter how long it may seem, you will die,'"" Gurnstein said. ""In other words, hang in there. In the long run, death will come at last."" Another regular section of the magazine, titled ""Your Great-Grandchildren,"" features full-color photos of various babies each week. ""Of course, the babies will be selected at random and not actually related to the viewer in any way, but the reader won't know that,"" Gurnstein explained. Also expected to be popular is the periodical's ""Time To Go To Church"" section, which features full-page color images of a church's exterior and interior, as well as images of people singing, Jesus hugging an old person, and smiling parsons who ""greet"" the reader. ""Going to 'church,' as they call it, is something many old people used to enjoy doing, for reasons we no longer understand,"" Gurnstein said. ""Hopefully, these pictures will not only remind them of this long-gone weekly comfort, but, if they hold it close enough to their faces, they might also be able to pretend that they are actually there."" Though less than a week old, the new magazine is already a hit among the elderly. ""Don't want to stay in the Center,"" raved Abraham Kriege, 97, speaking from his tiny cubicle at Sacred Aged Rest Golden Hills Retiree Center. ""Tired of looking at wallEE When I die? When?""dded Henry Koon, 89: ""Help me. Please."" As popular as it is with the aged, Old People is arguably even more well-liked by their families. ""Every few minutes Grandma would demand we take her to the bathroom, even though she's been using adult diapers for eight years,"" said Hannah Swoboda, 41. ""Even after we put her in the nursing home, she'd call all the time''Want come back, want come back.' It was so tiresome. But now that she's got Old People magazine, that's all changed. Now we can barely drag her out of that home."" ""It's really made a big difference,"" said Frank Bryce, 59, whose 86-year-old mother Eunice has not left her house in over three years. ""God willing, she'll die soon, but even if she doesn't, now at least she has something to read while she sits there in her little wicker chair for hours on end."" The second issue of Old People magazine hits newsstands Dec. 20. It will include pictures of a horse and a duck.ss","entertainment, media, news, vol 30 issue 17, entertainment"

4016,X-Files Stars Appear At Friendship Skills Seminar,"CLEVELAND'X-Files fans from all over the Cleveland area flocked to the downtown Concourse Hotel this weekend to attend ""Relating To Others X-ceptionally,"" a traveling friendship skills seminar and encounter session targeted specifically at the program's socially inept fan base. ""The truth is out there,"" X-Files star David Duchovny told the predominantly male, all-white crowd. ""But friendship, real friendship'not the imaginary kind'is within yourselves."" More than 400 people paid $150 each to attend the two-day seminar, which teamed Duchovny and X-Files co-star Gillian Anderson with award-winning therapist Dr. Ellyn W. Rosenblum. ""Having David and Gillian at the seminar has really helped get people excited about improving their friendship skills,"" said Rosenblum, author of the best-selling Go For It!: 30 Days to a More Outgoing You. ""The response has been tremendous."" In addition to the thrill of meeting the stars of their favorite paranormal investigative TV show in person, seminar attendees also received important advice about engaging in social relations with others, even with those who are not X-Files characters. ""Sometimes, you can achieve the same sort of close, deeply involved relationship that you have with the characters we play on X-Files, but with another, living, non-fictional person, who actually lives in the real world,"" Anderson said. Continued Anderson: ""Agent Scully does not believe in spaceships. But she most definitely does believe in friendships."" Response from seminar attendees was overwhelmingly positive. ""Scully is a very skeptical FBI agent, and I was skeptical about this seminar at first,"" said Chris Froman, 23, reachable at www.xfiles.cancerman.com. ""But just as Mulder can convince Scully that anything's possible, I have also been convinced that friendship is a goal I might someday reach."" Added fan Frank ""The Doctor"" Hugh: ""Scully is sexy, but I like Lois Lane. Isn't Teri Hatcher hot?"" For at least one fan, the seminar led to an important ""letting-go"" of false dreams. Cleveland Heights resident Maria Renquist, 27, broke down in tears when she and Duchovny shared an ""honesty moment,"" mediated by Dr. Rosenblum, in which the actor told her kindly but firmly that he was not attracted to her, and never would be. ""I learned a lot today,"" Renquist said, ""like how Mulder is a fictional character and stuff."" According to Rosenblum, much credit for the event's success lies in its simulation of the attendees' imaginary fan-lives in a seminar setting. ""X-Files fans divide themselves into two categories,"" Rosenblum said. ""There are the 'Shippers' (short for 'relationshippers'), who are those who want Mulder and Scully to become romantically involved, and 'Non-Shippers,' who feel that a sexual relationship between the two characters, while vicariously fulfilling, would ruin the show's chemistry."" ""In my seminar,"" Rosenblum said, ""fans are divided into the same two categories, with 'Shippers' being the ones who desperately crave a relationship in real life, and 'Non-Shippers' being those who have given up hope of ever having a relationship with another person."" ""The slogan of X-Files is 'Trust No One,'"" Duchovny told the crowd in his closing remarks. ""But I want you to learn to trust each other, and let social relationships'just like the ones you've seen on TV'materialize in your own lives. The friends are out there.""","entertainment, celebrities, news, vol 30 issue 15, entertainment"
4017,Phish Collapses Onstage,"MORRISON, CO'The music world was shaken by tragedy Sunday night when members of the popular rock band Phish collapsed on stage after being overcome by the stench of concert-goers during a show at the Red Rocks Amphitheater 20 miles outside Denver. The collapse occurred approximately 40 minutes into the song ""You Enjoy Myself,"" when the four band members'Mike Gordon, Trey Anastasio, Johnathan Fishman and Page McConnell' became overwhelmed by a combination of body odor, marijuana and the patchouli oil many Phish fans use in lieu of bathing. The foursome was rushed to the emergency room of Denver Lutheran Hospital, where they were partially revived by emergency oxygen treatment. As of press time, the musicians are still listed in critical condition. Though authorities are still debating the cause of the tragedy, preliminary reports indicate that a mechanical malfunction in the band's $45 million on-stage ventilation system is to blame. The system, which employs five computer-controlled, industrial-sized wind machines to blow fumes away from the stage area, has been used by the million-selling group since 1992 to combat the ""danger layer"" of toxic odors which surround the band's rabid fan base at all times. Despite the ventilation breakdown, many observers feel that the real blame for the injuries lies with Phish itself, as for years the band has recklessly encouraged its fans' non-hygenic lifestyle. ""They've been burning the candle at both ends for way too long. This was bound to happen,"" said the EPA's Helen Duenoff, who as chair of the Hippie Band Toxicity Task Force has studied the effects of fan odor on members of bands like Phish, Rusted Root and Blues Traveler. ""Phish's message of 'party now, wash later' has simply got to change."" Further controversy stems from the fact that efforts to save the stricken musicians were hampered by a semi-riot which occurred when rescue workers attempted to gain access to the stage area. Surrounding the fallen performers in a circle of linked hands and attempting to heal them with ""crystal light energy"" and an improvised version of ""Silent in the Morning,"" several hundred Phish fans erupted into violence at the sight of the gas mask-wearing, uniformed rescue personnel. With angry shouts of ""Attica!"" and ""Off the pig!"" fans hurled hacky sacks and bongs at paramedics, and blocked ambulances arriving at the accident scene with hastily erected barricades. Forming a linked-arm ""human wall,"" the fans effectively trapped Phish and paramedics in a deadly envelope of unbreathable toxic vapor, holding off attempts to remove the band to safety for a full 30 minutes before finally being cleared by riot police, who used high-pressure fire hoses filled with a powerful soap/water solution to disperse the crowd. ""That was so wrong of those cops, man,"" said odorous fan Kathy Breyer, 20, whose brand-new hemp necklace and tie-dyed ""Phishisgruvin"" T-shirt were ruined in the hosing incident. ""And worst of all, they did it right when the band was about to play 'Slave to the Traffic Light.'"" Added Breyer: ""I have 940 bootlegs."" Only one member of Phish, singer/guitarist Trey Anastasio, managed to escape serious harm in the incident, going backstage unnoticed during one of the band's trademark hour-long jams to rest and consume drugs. Anastasio was visibly moved as he spoke to the public. ""I want to thank all our fans for massing here at the hospital in such incredible numbers, but believe me, we really need you to leave now,"" a gas-masked Anastasio said. ""We appreciate the candlelight vigil and the chanting and all that, but the doctors all agree: We cannot hope to revive the rest of the guys unless we can somehow isolate them from the deadly column of vapors rising from the crowd."" Anastasio then attempted to rouse the assembled fans in a sing-along. ""The skin is the part under the arm that makes contact with the soap,"" he sang to the crowd. ""The soap is the bar that you use in the bath at your abode."" Two minutes into the refrain, Anastasio collapsed as well. Phish's tour manager, Todd Geerholz, has vowed that steps will be taken to ensure that such an incident is not repeated. ""We are talking with Ticketron right now about requiring a chemical sponge bath for each customer before a ticket can be purchased,"" Geerholz said. ""We're also definitely going to add a big personal hygiene appendix to next year's edition of the Phish Pharmers Almanac. If this is still not enough, Phish may have to forego touring altogether."" Preliminary testing indicates that as long as Phish's fans are not gathered together at one place for any extended lenghth of time, the stench rising from their unclean bodies will remain well under the life-threatening level. Sunday's Phish collapse marks the most serious odor-related incident at a rock concert since July 1988, when Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh fell into a coma after an obese female fan ran on stage and hugged him during a show at Chicago's Soldier Field.","entertainment, music, news, vol 30 issue 15, entertainment"

4019,New Fox Sitcom Outrageous,"LOS ANGELES'According to television industry insiders, a new Fox sitcom scheduled to debut Nov. 17 is outrageous. The new program, Sweet Georgia Washington, stars rapper Sandy ""Pepa"" Denton (of Salt-n-Pepa fame) as Georgia Washington, a wise-cracking, back-sassing White House maid who interferes with political affairs each week, stirring up major trouble for the President (Howard Hesseman). ""When you see this new show,"" said longtime television executive Myron Bell, ""I think you will understand why it is being called 'the outrageous new comedy from the creators of Martin.'"" As a recent Fox commercial for Sweet Georgia Washington announced, ""This Sunday night, the federal government is about to get hitEE below the beltway.""ccording to Morton Zollner, Fox senior vice-president of marketing, the key to the new sitcom is its no-holds-barred uproariousness. ""You won't believe some of the things that Georgia does,"" Zollner said. ""For example, in the first episode, an old friend from high school comes to visit, and to impress her, Georgia gets the prime minister of Israel to pretend to be her boyfriend."" ""I won't give away the end,"" Zollner said, ""but let's just say it's outrageous.""

4021,The Story of Romeo and Juliet Is Not A Very Good Love Story,"It is at this time of the year that many a young man's thoughts turn to love and wooing the fairer sex. And, I ask you, what better place to take your lady friend on a first date than to take them to the pictures? Ah, the magical moving pictures on the silver screen! There have been many occasions where a young suitor took a dame to the bijou and was rewarded with a smooch on the cheek, I am told. And so it was in my day, when romance was not just a word! When I decided to marry my wife, Toots, I first went to ask her father, ""May I get hitched with your daughter?"" and he told me to get on the next bus out of town but I did not listen to him and Toots and I got married anyway, because I raised a ladder to her window and we snuck off into the night to be married. Today, young lovers get married at the drop of a hat, and often engage in the intercourse of sex before the ink is even dry on their marriage certificate! Many people blame the movies for this problem, and to them I say, ""You are right!"" Because there is far too much sexiness in the films of today. That is why I am voting for that fellow with the fine suit for president, if I can find my voting place to cast my ballot. So, don't forget to vote! In our country, America, every vote is counted as one vote! As the popular commercial says, ""Just vote!"" The Story of Romeo and Juliet was a very bad movie because it was so loud and sexy. My God, I thought I would meet the reaper when I saw that film, because the things moved so fast I was scared, and my head hurt because there was too much music and everything was exploding except for the people in the film and the trees in the film and some of the cars in the film that didn't explode. Much of the ""music"" was not music at all, and that is why I used quote marks when I wrote music, because it is not music at all, but that is what people call it! My mail has not been coming on time lately. I can remember back when I was living in Goshen, the mail would arrive before I was even awake in the morning, and I could wake up and greet the day with a cup of joe and a stack of pancakes and a sack of mail to read, and I would read some of it on the toilet, too. But now my mail-man seems to think that he can take his time and deliver the mail late in the day, during The Price is Right. One woman won a car but she did not deserve it because in my opinion, the ball did not go in the right slot. The good old days! The movie I went to see to review this month was called The Adventures of Romeo and Juliet, and it had the same name as a play that people used to read before the Nazi times. I never read the play, though, so I do not know anything about it. But it has been said that Romeo and Juliet's Story is a good love story, and I may be long in the tooth, but I am in the mood for love! So I went to see the movie, even though I had to pay for it myself. The movies today cost so much that you should spend your money on a davenport because it would be cheaper to sit on a new blue davenport than to go to the movies. Romeo and Juliet are two young people, but I did not understand what anyone was saying in the movie because they were all talking with the ""slang"" language of youth that I have read so much about in my periodicals. I did not understand what anyone was saying, and the sights were so loud that I put my hands over my ears and then I closed my eyes because there were too many colors and my noggin hurt, and I had no pills. Toots (my wife of 43 years) used up all the pills because she dropped a can of peaches on her ankle, and now she doesn't walk too good. At the end of the movie, there were two characters, and I think they were the characters named Romeo and Juliet but I am not sure because everyone was talking in circles. It was written in a sloppy fashion. Today's movie makers do not even know how to write a sentence correctly so that people can understand the sentence they wrote good. But they went to church and the boy drank some poison and the girl shot herself in the church! And that is no way to end a love story, because now they are both dead, and can love no more. And this is the time of the year for love. The boy should have put a ladder up to the window of the young girl and taken her off into the night. But he should have purchased a bouquet of flowers, first, because that is the gentlemanly thing to do. Perhaps one day I will write to Hollywood and tell them how to write a real romance that will curl your socks. But I cannot do that today because I need to put a sign on my lawn to warn the dogs to stay off my lawn. In conclusion, The Story of Romeo and Juliet was not a very good movie, and I hope the mail-man starts delivering my coupons earlier so I can go about the business of my day's work because I have two coupons for fudge, and if I get only one more coupon for fudge they will give me a free piece of fudge. Next month, I will once again decide the fate of a movie. It is not always easy sending directors and stars to the poor house, but people need to know if a movie is bad or good. Maybe I will write to the post office about that mail-man and tell them to talk to him about his tardiness. The good old days! Well, until next time, I'll see you on the romantic Silver Screen.

She was merely re-organizing the action section of the Blockbuster Video store in which she works and had to handle the tapes Exterminator 2 and Posse. Solo, the Van Peebles vehicle in which he plays a futuristic android/soldier, is still showing in a handful of budget cinemas, yet has failed to entice any potential moviegoers.

4029,Price Is Right Demands Pullout Of U.S. Forces,"BURBANK, CA'Mark Goodson, executive producer of CBS's The Price Is Right, has delivered an ultimatum to President Clinton: Withdraw all occupying U.S. forces from the game show or face ""a war to make the continent weep."" The occupation, which began last spring in response to reports of treaty violations and human rights abuses on the part of the popular, long-running game show, has been building to a standoff for months. The U.S. is demanding an unconditional surrender on the part of The Price Is Right, including the full dismantling of the Range Game and the relinquishing of an undisclosed number of cans of Johnson's Turtle Wax. In an address last night to the American people, President Clinton said, ""I have made every attempt to prevent a military confrontation and will continue to do so. But if the fabulous 60-minute Price Is Right will not stand before a U.N. tribunal for the crimes of which they are accused, we cannot and will not acquiesce."" Promised Clinton, ""America is strong and her forces stand ready. This will not be another Tic Tac Dough."" Goodson was vehement in his refusal to cooperate. ""Television's most exciting hour of fun and prizes will not be cowed by the demands of heretics,"" he said in a statement broadcast to U.S. markets via CBS affiliates. ""President Clinton, you have until the second Showcase Showdown to remove all U.S. troops from our studio and the surrounding lot or we shall no longer be responsible for their fate. God have mercy on you all."" The Price is Right, in which contestants win cash and prizes for estimating the prices of retail goods, has taken a considerably more somber turn in recent months. In the show's opening moments, flashing light bulbs border the screen as the audience is shown trembling in their seats and attempting not to make eye contact with the armed CBS pages who patrol the studio aisles. When contestants' names are read by the show's announcer, Rod Roddy, many faint or begin praying. Those who remain lucid walk quietly but visibly shaken to Contestant's Row, though one will occasionally attempt to subdue a guard and escape. Three contestants have been shot attempting this. A rescue attempt last month failed when a company of U.S. Marines infiltrated the audience and fired a rocket launcher at the set. Host Bob Barker and model Holly Robinson took shelter behind the Plinko board; two other Barker's Beauties died in the skirmish. Said Barker: ""The next item up for bid isEE death!""he game show's military strength does not appear to have the Pentagon worried. U.S. Intelligence indicates its entire army has been cobbled together from merchandise intended as prizes. While impressive grenades have been jury-rigged from cans of Pam cooking spray, the show's most powerful land assault vehicle is a 1997 Cadillac de Ville equipped with 10-ounce bottles of Spray 'n' Wash and several dozen boxes of Hot Pockets. American citizens are concerned about the prospect of war with a highly rated TV game show. ""Nothing is worth spilling the blood of young Americans,"" said Chicago-area investment banker Todd Gerhardt. ""Not even a Broyhill Herculon living room ensemble with matching Panasonic entertainment center."" Antiwar demonstrators have staked out the Capitol building bearing placards reading ""No Blood For Fabulous Prize Showcases."" Former President Jimmy Carter is being briefed by State Department officials in the hope that he can facilitate diplomatic relations to end the standoff. Carter's actions were instrumental in defusing the 151-day Hollywood Squares hostage crisis in 1979 and securing the release of celebrity panelist Paul Lynde.

4032,Evel Knievel To Attempt Huge Leap In Logic,"LAS VEGAS'Daredevil Evel Knievel, famous for performing thrilling, death-defying, physical feats, will bravely defy common sense at Caesar's Palace this Saturday. In a never-before-tried leap of logic, Knievel will attempt to convince a panel of renowned math experts that there exists a single largest integer to which no more can be added. At noon Saturday, before an expected crowd of 25,000, a helmeted, jumpsuited Knievel will step to a podium decorated with logos of products sponsoring the leap, including STP and Chuckles jelly candies. He will then begin a syllogistic process of gaining larger and larger concessions from the panel of math professors, hoping to bring them to the conclusion that there exists a number x for which there is no possible x+1. If a majority of the 12-member panel agrees with Knievel's reasoning, the leap will be deemed a success. Despite Knievel's determination, many panel members view the jump as reckless and ill-advised. ""With all due respect to Mr. Knievel, he is mad to attempt this,"" said Quentin Collins, Ph.D., a professor of math at Yale University. ""I almost declined to serve on the panel in protest of this utterly ill-conceived dance of cerebral mayhem. But I expect Knievel will learn a lesson he will never forget when his fallacious reasoning is sliced to ribbons."" ""I worry every time he does this that he'll make a mistake and get hurt,"" said Robbie Knievel, son of the famous daredevil. ""But it's what he wants to do and I support him."" Safety precautions planned by Knievel for the leap include comprehensive, indexed copies of the writings of Plato, an intellectual ""pit crew"" of logic and rhetoric experts, and strategically placed fire extinguishers in case the attempt goes awry. ""My mother always wanted me to get a desk job,"" Knievel said. ""But I gotta do what I gotta do. I believe that this leap of the imagination is possible, and I intend to prove it."" Knievel added that kids should not attempt to imitate the stunt, and that wearing a bicycle helmet is radical. Knievel, who has broken nearly every bone in his body, gave up physical stunts several years ago and has since turned to more conceptual feats. In November 1993, he thrilled the world with a spectacular triple-leap-of-faith, in which he simultaneously joined the Unification Church of Sun Myung Moon, the Church of Scientology and Jehovah's Witnesses, accepting in rapid succession the controversial beliefs of all three religions. A month later, trapped in three contradictory philosophies, Knievel wrestled with existential doubt and rejected all three movements, staging a spectacular fall from grace seen by millions on pay-per-view television. Knievel's recent career has not been without its hazards and setbacks. Last April 15, at the Tropicana Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, Knievel plunged headlong into a morass of complicated tax forms only to be trapped without the necessary financial records to complete them. Emergency accountants intervened, pulling Knievel from the paperwork and completing the tax forms themselves before rushing him to an area hospital. If successful this Saturday, Knievel next plans to visit a Club Med Resort in Ixtapa, Mexico, where he will attempt a daring escape from the dreary nine-to-five workaday world.","entertainment, celebrities, news, vol 30 issue 09, entertainment"

4038,The First Wife's Club Had Divorced Women In It,"I saw an advertisement on the television set the other night while I was watching my favorite program, Archie Bunker, for the movie which is called The First Wifes Club. And I was watching the television with my wife, Toots, because she is often laughing at the antics of the wife on that program because she is a wife, too. So I decided to see the First Wifes Movie to review for you in my column, and I decided to take Toots, because she is my wife, and I thought she might enjoy a night at the pictures. The pictures! In my day, a night at the pictures with your lady meant a night of romance. But alas, today at the pictures people are too busy watching the violence and the action to be hit by Cupid's arrow. When I was a young man of 27 I would go to see the movies with a dame on my arm, and we would sit in the balcony and if I was lucky she would let me reach into her sack of delicious candied figs, which they sold in those days. But today you go to the movies, and all they sell you are expensive foods that are too salty, and they cost you a lot of hard-earned money, too. I told the fellow at the concessions stand that I should get some free popped corn because I was the critic for the local Gazette, but he just told me that he had never read my column and that I would have to step aside because the lady behind me wanted to buy a Fanta. If that young man only knew of the influence I wield in the town of the movies, Hollywood, he would treat me with more respect, I imagine. But he would never make it in the pictures anyway because he had a face like a sack of yams. Toots and I went to see the movie called The First Wifes Club because I wanted to review it. So I saw the movie, and then I called my editor and he told me they did not need a review so I threw my review in the garbage but then he called me back to say that they would be able to run my review after all so I went to the garbage and dug my review of The First Wifes Club out of the garbage and the garbage smelled foul and my sportcoat got a coffee stain on it. So I took my sportcoat to the cleaners and they said the stain might be hard to get out. I will tell you in my next column if they were able to get the stain out. My mother could always clean the stains, even if they were made with jam! So I do not see why the cleaners cannot get a stain out. My mother died in 1947, two years before my father. So here is my review of The First Wife's Club: I went to see the movie called The First Wife's Club. It is not a very good movie. I went with my wife, Toots, and we were surprised to see that the ladies in question were not wifes at all, but divorced women of questionable moral standing. One of them was played by the actress Goldie Pond, and she was a firebrand! I do not think that people should take the institution of marriage lightly. Toots and I were married in 1943, and it has not always been smooth sailing but we never got the divorce. Because it is said that divorce goes against the laws of man and God! And when we took our vows we decided to stay together ""until death do us part."" And we are still living so we are still married. These young people today get married, and then they think it is all a big joke and they get a divorce the first time they get in a fight and throw pans at each other. I have never been in a fight with Toots, but one time she hit me with a rolling pin because she was angry that I was not trying to get a job but I was getting checks from the government so there was no reason for me to get a job and I wanted to stay home and watch the fights. I must admit that my skull hurt for some time afterward. There was also a scene in The First Wifes Club where they dropped a piano out of a window, and it looked to me to be a waste of a fine piano. In conclusion, let me just say that The First Wifes Club made me wish I had a club so I could hit myself on the head with the club and then I would not have to watch the movie, because it was a real sleeper, and not very reverent! I will review a movie next month and maybe I will appreciate that one better, but I am not sure. But there is still no business like show business, like no business I know. Everything about it is appealing, anything the traffic will allow. Nowhere can you get that happy feeling when you are stealing that extra bow. That is a song I once heard. Until next time, I'll see you on the Silver Screen. Mr. Danielson's column is reprinted from the Butternut Gazette in Butternut, Ohio.

4040,MTV Launches 'Rock the Census' Campaign,"NEW YORK'With four years to go before 2000, MTV is already launching a campaign designed to ensure widespread Generation X participation in the decennial national census survey. ""Let's be gettin' tallied!"" popular rap artist/television star Queen Latifah shouted to the crowd at a free concert kicking off the ""Rock the Census"" program. ""Yo'somebody say cen-susEE Cen-sus! Sur-veyEE sur-vey! Hell, yeah!""ording to MTV officials, in addition to a series of free concerts, the Rock the Census program will include: special Blockbuster-sponsored registration spots; an interactive website where teens can ""chat"" with rock stars like Lenny Kravitz and Jewel about the history of the census; and a fleet of recreational vehicles, or DemographicMobiles, that will travel around the country distributing to teens brightly colored packets of raw statistical data about the U.S. populace. Tabitha Soren, an MTV reporter well-known for her hard-hitting, in-depth investigative journalism, said that the Rock the Census program is an outgrowth of the network's ""Rock the Vote"" campaign, begun during the 1992 presidential campaign, which as of July 1996 had registered more than 80 new voters across the country. ""Back in 1990, a lot of young people didn't participate in the census,"" Soren said. ""Most of them just didn't think it was 'cool.' Well, by the time 2000 rolls around, we want every kid in America to know that it's cool to be counted."" Also on hand to launch the campaign was Matt LeBlanc, star of NBC's runaway smash-hit comedy Friends, who is featured in the first on-air spot. LeBlanc said he was ""excited and honored"" to be part of the drive. ""The Census is really important, and it's important that young people recognize that importance,"" LeBlanc said. Soren gave a preview of the website (http:www.mtv.census.cool!.com), which in addition to major rock stars will feature Census-related trivia, interviews with Census workers, and easy-to-follow practice forms designed to make giving personal statistical information like age and annual income fun. Web-surfers will also be able to download several specially written Census songs, like the Red Hot Chili Peppers' ""Funk'n Up Your Seven-Page Census Form"" and Prince's ""U R 2 Quantifiable 4 the U.S. Bureau of Statistics."" MTV has grown increasingly active on the political scene in the past few years. In conjunction with last year's early April tax rush, the network aired ""Yo!

4041,Burt Reynolds Lives Like a Princess,"I've interviewed scores of Hollywood stars, but I never took them at anything more than face value, especially Burt Reynolds. I never guessed the truth behind this model of masculinity, whose virile mustache has lit a fire in the dreams of countless lovelorn. But who would have guessed that his mustache hides a pretty pout? Who would have guessed that Burt Reynolds, manly star of Cannonball Run and Sharky's Machine, lives like a princess? When I pull into the driveway of Burt's oceanfront mansion, I expect to be greeted at the door by Burt and perhaps be offered a beer. Instead, I'm escorted down chandelier-lit hallways by a wigged man in a frock coat and tights, who explains to me in hushed tones that certain preparations are still being made. Out of the corner of my eye, I see a chamber filled with bustling attendants, running to and fro in a storm of perfume and hairbrushes. In the center of the room sits a figure in a silk corset whose face is hidden from me. I am moved along. As I wait in the garden outside, I enjoy the blooming roses and the rushing water of a splendid fountain. I sip peppermint tea, and cool garden breezes caress my skin. But these luxuries are quickly forgotten as the air is filled with the dulcet soprano voice of Burt Reynolds, singing softly. After a rustle of petticoats announces his appearance, Burt steps into the garden. Resplendent in a pink velvet gown, he extends a bejeweled hand. ""Enchanté,"" he whispers, and we sit in the shade of a spreading magnolia. ""I'd like to show you something,"" he says, pulling a flower from an ornate golden case. ""This is a magic blossom'with one sniff, you can smell what anyone in the kingdom is cooking! Would you believe I got it from a swineherd for 10 kisses?"" We both laugh over this charming anecdote. But when I ask about his past, Burt grows solemn. ""I had three older sisters who hated me, for I was the prettiest child,"" he says. ""They made me slave away in the kitchen, and called me names. Horrible names, like 'stupid goose' and 'scullery girl.' I longed to escape from that life, and with the financial success of Smokey and the Bandit, I did."" ""I am happy,"" he says, with a touch of sadness in his voice. ""But sometimes I wonder what the world is like beyond my garden wall."" After gifting me with one more lovely song, Burt regretfully announces he is retiring. I join him half an hour later in his private bedchamber. He begins to thank me for coming, but is distracted by some sort of discomfort. Even with a dozen mattresses piled on his canopy bed, he cannot relax. Melancholy swells from his pretty eyes as he weakly tosses and turns. Suddenly, his problem becomes clear to me. I carefully reach underneath the mattresses and pull out a single pea. Gratitude floods Burt's face, and he allows me to kiss his hand before he sinks into slumber. I am led to the front gate, where a carriage awaits me. I am filled with sadness at leaving Burt Reynolds, and I find myself wishing I could stay with this precious soul in his castle by the sea forever.","opinion, entertainment, commentary, vol 30 issue 05, lancio, entertainment"

4044,The Island of Doctors and Monsters Is Not a Very Good Movie,"Ah, the movies. The lights. The glamour. The action! Where else can a person escape to see the stars for the price of a good shave at the corner barber store? Hollywood town! Where a young ingenue can hitch her dreams to a rising star and sit on the director's couch and rise to the top of the Silver Screen. As you know, I am a respected and feared critic here at the Butternut Gazette, where once a month, space permitting, I wield my poison pen and decide the fates of the movies. I am one of the harshest critics in the business because I have reviewed over 11 movies in the past 20 years, and in all my years I have only given a good review to one of those movies and that movie was Beetlejuice. It is critics like myself that directors fear because my review can send them to the poor house if I don't think their movie is so good! But gone are the days when a man could enjoy a fine cigar and fish dinner while taking in a picture show. Last week my editor, who is a young man named Steve and who lives two blocks away from us, just past Kent Avenue and up near the water tower, called me and told me I could see the movie called The Doctor and the Island and the Monsters. I asked my wife, Toots, if she wanted to go see that movie and she said no because it looked like it had the sex and I said fine. And I saw a commercial for that movie on the television machine and it didn't look too good because there were people in it running around in the jungle with makeup on their faces like ladies except they weren't ladies, they were men of action! And one of the men was in a duel with a monster and that looked to be a spooky sight. But my editor, Steve, told me to see it because otherwise I couldn't review a movie this month. And then he said it was the only movie left to review because he had given all the other reviews to a young ""hot-shot."" I told Steve (my editor) that I should talk to the young ""hot-shot"" because I could teach him a thing or two about the movie business! But Steve said that would not be necessary. I went to see the movie alone without Toots but that was okay because she said she had to finish on the toilet. Down at the bijou in my town they do not have ushers to help you to your seat. My God, you'd think they wanted you to trip and break your neck! In my day a man could take his best girl to the movies and buy her a cotton candy treat and after the movie they could sit under a tree and the fella would try and look at the girl's ankle because that was scandalous in my day! But now on the television programs you see the breasts. Well, let me just say that That Monster Doctor's Island was not a very good movie. It starred the young ""up-and-coming"" actor Valentino Kilmers, who is a fine young man, but I did not approve of his broad shoulders in this movie. But he is an actor to watch for! It also starred another man. And it also starred a lady, and she seemed to be a swell dame. And it also starred the actor of actors, Mr. Marlon Branderson. Mr. Branderson is a star from the great old guard of Hollywood motion picture making in the studio days. He was in a movie once called The Fresh Man, about a man who wanted a lizard because he was a man of means and a criminal. And he was also in a couple of other movies, among them A Stagecoach of Desire, in which he sang a famous song about the Wells Fargo wagon while yelling his sweetheart's name very loudly and very late at night and the girl came down and sang on the stagecoach with him. Except that maybe I am thinking of another movie, and Toots and I walked out of that movie anyway because he was standing around in his undergarments and he had no decency. None at all! But they don't make pictures like that anymore because it was a musical picture and all music today sounds like banging on a can. I had to leave halfway through The Island Monster Doctor Movie because the seat had a spring in it and the spring kept poking me where the sun doesn't shine! And when I say that I think you know what I mean, but I cannot be more specific because that kind of talk is for the Service. I was in the Navy during the Great War, but I fell off a boat because Shorty hit me in the head with a mop. But you do not know Shorty because that was not his real name and I do not remember his real name and it was an accident that he hit me with the mop. And Shorty is dead now anyway because life is a flighty bird. Next month I will review another movie. Well, until next time, I will see you on the Silver Screen!

4045,Artistic Sensibility Takes Backseat to Commerical Consideration,"HOLLYWOOD, CA'Artistic sensibility took a backseat to commercial consideration yesterday, when independent writer-director Norm Blugoth's semi-autobiographical opus, Shadows, Dimly: A Life Remembered was purchased, revamped and re-released by Mammoth Video under the new title Tit Planet. ""We liked the original version,"" said Mammoth Video president Ron Hillman of Blugoth's intimate look at a young boy growing up in an abusive household. ""We simply felt it needed just a little something extra."" Blugoth recieved an advance of approximately $14,000 for the sale of the repackaged Tit Planet, which will feature teen heartthrob Corey Feldman as a hard-boiled desperado rocket pilot from the year 2399, who is captured and seduced by a mysterious topless alien race known as the Succulons. Blugoth's entire advance immediately went toward the massive debt he has been shouldering from the project his entire adult life, only partially offsetting the tremendous bills he owes creditors. ""For 17 years I worked as a stockboy in a nationwide discount supermarket chain, slaving away in obscurity, channeling the desperate sense of meaninglessness my life inspired into a screenplay I hoped would one day be found after my death,"" Blugoth said. ""With each brightly colored box of sugar cereal my trembling hands neatly stacked, I took solace only in the faith that my screenplay would one day be recognized for its subtleties of character, story and milieu. It was all that kept me going."" Mammoth Video publicity director Brianna Shalimar shared Blugoth's enthusiasm about the project. ""We're really excited about Tit Planet here at Mammoth Video's award-winning public relations department,"" Shalimar told reporters. ""We feel sure that Tit Planet, starring hunky Corey Feldman and fiesty Latin newcomer Conchita Marisando will be the straight-to-video R-rated erotic-thriller/ action/sci-fi release of November."" ""If you liked last year's surprise hit Postapocalyptic Panty Girls,"" Shalimar added, ""you'll love Tit Planet, coming this fall to a video retail outlet near you!"" After burning all traces of his writings and scrawling ""Take Me Demons"" in his own feces on the wall of his East Los Angeles flat, Blugoth plans to blow his brains out with a double-barrelled shotgun he purchased earlier this week after pawning the typewriter that was his only possession of value for the last 15 years of his life.","entertainment, advertising, news, vol 30 issue 03, entertainment"

4054,'Entertainment Weekly' Utilizes Pun in Article About Tom Cruise,"NEW YORK'It is a mere two weeks after the release of the summer blockbuster Mission: Impossible, and Lori Skedelesky, an associate editor at Entertainment Weekly, can claim responsibility for one of the most clever turns of phrase in recent journalistic history: 'Cruise Control.' 'I'm very proud of it,' says Skedelesky of the headline, which appeared in the summer movie preview issue of the magazine. 'I was sitting around racking my brains, when all of a sudden it occurred to me that [the actor]'s last name seemed somehow familiar to me. On a hunch, I looked it up in a dictionary. Sure enough, I found it'and not just as a proper noun, but as a regular noun and a verb.' The dictionary hunt proved a bonanza for Skedelesky, who discovered to her amazement that 'cruise' not only is a word in its own right, but also forms part of many 'phrases,' or groups of words commonly used together. One of these was 'cruise control,' which Skedelesky notes is 'a feature in modern automobiles that allows them to maintain a constant speed.' But what relevance does an automotive convenience have to the mega-star of Losin' It and Taps? That's where Skedelesky's training as a journalist came into play. The tenacious Skedelesky, following her instincts and the lead of popular literary critics like Jacques Derrida and Cindy Adams, decided to take the phrase 'cruise control' and deconstruct it into its constituent parts'namely, 'cruise' and 'control.' When she did'presto! 'It was a real 'Eureka!' moment,' says Skedelesky, who earned her stripes at Columbia University's School of Journalism and TV Guide. 'He's not only the star of the movie, but its producer. Now, everyone knows that producers have a lot of power, or control, over a film. So, the kind of power the producer of Mission: Impossible has is 'cruise control.' Capitalize the two words, and you have a very concise way of expressing the motif of the article.' But 'conciseness isn't its only virtue,' notes Harold Bloom, Professor Emeritus of Literature at Yale University. 'To those readers already familiar with the phrase 'cruise control' from its usual context, the sudden realization of its applicability in an entirely different area of human experience will send a frisson of delight through their veins, in recognition of the principle of synchronicity at once so ubiquitous yet so hidden in our daily lives.' The modest Skedelesky admits that the rest of Entertainment Weekly's staff is abuzz over her work. In fact, her boss, senior editor Denise Bankman, told reporters that associate editors usually don't have the experience to come up with headlines by themselves, but that they are encouraged to 'pitch' ideas at the creative meetings each week. 'To expect that level of idea from an associate editor is unrealistic,' Bankman says. 'But every now and then, one of them strikes gold. Right after she came to me with the idea, I told Lori, 'Welcome to the big leagues.'' But beyond the 152-person editorial staff of the magazine, the two-word masterpiece earned Skedelesky an even bigger fan'Mr. Cruise Control himself! 'He called me yesterday,' blushes Skedelesky. 'Well, not really. It was his publicist's assistant, and she said how much Mr. Cruise enjoyed the article and thanked me for doing my part to make the movie a success. He's incredibly down-to-earth.' Fresh off her 'headline-making' success with Tom Cruise, Skedelesky has been assigned another celebrity-profile article, this time of Friends' David Schwimmer. Skedelesky says 'mum's the word' about the headline of the Schwimmer piece, but she assures us that it goes 'even further into the realm of wordplay,' and adds cryptically, 'People who use pools to exercise will particularly enjoy it.'","entertainment, archive, news, vol 29 issue 20, entertainment"

4056,Hard Times Hit Springsteenville,"SPRINGSTEENVILLE, U.S.A.'Across America, cities are facing shrinking job bases and plant closings. But nowhere has the recent industrial slowdown hit harder than Springsteenville. A blue-collar, rust-belt city whose 75,000 inhabitants are almost all factory-employed Vietnam veterans, Springsteenville was once considered an ideal American town, but now faces a state of economic emergency. 'Our glory days have passed us by,' says Mayor Joe Roberts, whose parents came to Springsteenville in 1951 to work in the city's then-booming auto plant. 'The situation is similar to the wink of a young girl's eye.' With the recent closing of Springsteenville's textile mill, located across the railroad tracks, unemployment has hit an all-time high of 34 percent. 'It seems like there's always another plant closing down,' Roberts lamented. 'Once we stood for a hard day's work for a day's pay. But now, these jobs are going, boys. And they ain't coming back.' 'To your hometown,' the mayor continued. 'Your hometown.' Unemployment is at an all-time high in Springsteenville, and it appears that spirits have never been lower. Most of the city's workers served their country bravely in the 1960s and '70s, when, after getting in a little hometown jam, they had rifles thrust into their hands. 'I was sent to a foreign land,' said Kyle Braley, who works on the highway in nearby Darlington County. 'To go and kill the yellow man.' In the 1980s, Springsteenville was a symbol of working-class pride and patriotic vigor, but by 1996, Springsteenville has seen better days and is increasingly in danger of becoming a sad caricature of its former self. One petroleum worker (who asked not to be named) said that upon returning from Vietnam he had gone back to the refinery, but the hiring officer refused him, saying that, son, it was unfortunately not up to him. The veteran then tried approaching his V.A. man, who similarly replied, 'Son, don't you understand?' Adding to Springsteenville's woes is the recent drastic rise in teen delinquency. Fueled by the perception among youth that the city is both a death trap and a suicide rap, many teens are getting out while they are young. Underage drinking is an epidemic and teen pregnancy is at an all-time high, as many high school-age teens go down to the river, despite the fact that the river is dry. Some teens are proving it all night, typically out in the street. Others, such as local teens Bobby Jean, Wendy and Rosalita, have opted simply to run away. One disaffected factory worker told reporters that life in Springsteenville makes him feel as if someone took an edgy, dull knife and cut a six-inch valley through the middle of his soul. He also noted that he is on fire. Compounding Springsteenville's economic woes are the city's tremendous traffic problems, with many residents turning to their automobiles as a way out. Among the most popular auto-related escapes: driving all night, racing in the street, cruising on the oft-visited Thunder Road, and driving either stolen or used cars. 'It's true,' Mayor Roberts confirms. 'Our highways are jammed with broken heroes on a last-chance power drive. This is terrible, and not just because of the risk of a tragic wreck on the highway. We can't have kids thinking that they can skip some school, shoot some pool, act real cool, stay out all night, and it will be all right.' The rising tide of hopelessness among Springsteenville's young has contributed to an equally swift rise in the crime rate. Residents of the suburbs are afraid to go out at night, largely due to a recent, much-publicized freeze-out on 10th Avenue. 'I was stranded in the jungle trying to take in all the heat they was giving,' recalled victim Bad Scooter, speaking from his hospital bed. 'I then turned around the corner, and things got extremely quiet, extremely fast.' Police are still investigating the incident.

Gabor, who remained an icon of Hollywood glamour throughout her more than 40 years in show business, was best known for either her role on TV's Green Acres or for her frequent guest appearances on the 1970s ABC hit, The Love Boat. In 1991, either she or her sister Zsa Zsa or Eva had a much-publicized run-in with law enforcement officials, in which she slapped a police officer.

4059,"Unabomber Condemned by Willie Tyler, Lester","WASHINGTON, D.C.'In an official ceremony held at the Justice Department Monday, ventriloquist Willie Tyler and his dummy, Lester, strongly condemned Una-bomber suspect Theodore Ka-czynski. The news media, Clinton administration officials, FBI agents and numerous family members of Unabomber victims were present to observe the somber public censure, which took place as part of a double header with former Phyllis Diller joke-writer Mel Habusch. In his first set, Tyler called the terrorist acts of the Unabomber 'cold, senseless acts of terror, which wrought tragedy upon the entire nation.' Tyler then turned to Lester to ask his opinion. 'Lester,' he said, 'Do you think the Unabomber is a cold, senseless killer?' 'He is indeed,' Lester said. 'He is a heartless monster.' All in attendance were both touched by the ceremony and entertained by the amusing Lester, a diminutive, bespectacled replica of Tyler. The Unabomber is suspected of mailing or planting at least 20 bombs since the late 1970s, killing three people and causing millions of dollars in damage. His Luddite manifesto revealed a misanthropic loner who resorted to anonymous acts of terrorism to further his political agenda. Willie Tyler is a renowned ventriloquist who, with his dummy, Lester, has performed in venues nationwide, including the Stars Ballroom in Lake Tahoe and the Bahama Hotel in Atlantic City. He has also been a frequent guest on popular television programs such as The Merv Griffin Show, The Captain and Tenille Show, and Joe Franklin's All Star Memories. In a touching memorial to the victims of the Unabomber, Tyler employed skillful 'rapid-fire' delivery between a ventriloquist and his dummy to list the names of the victims. 'Mary Watkins,' Tyler said. 'Mary Watkins?' Lester responded incredulously. 'Judge Thomas Whallen,' Tyler said. 'Judge Thomas Whallen?' Lester dutifully repeated. 'Lester,' Tyler said, breaking the rhythm momentarily. 'I'm trying to read the list of Unabomber victims.' 'Oh, then go right ahead,' Lester said. Lester then continued to quickly interrupt Tyler after each name, seemingly unhindered by Tyler's polite request to stop the behavior. After a fast reading of the victims' names, the audience applauded politely. 'I am pleased to add the voices of both Willie Tyler and Lester to the chorus of condemnation leveled at the Unabomber,' President Clinton said in a statement from the White House. 'It is important that we as a society condemn the Unabomber's horrific acts of terrorism,' FBI director Bernard Whernan said. 'And it is vital that both Willie Tyler and Lester be among the leading voices of that condemnation.' In his second set, Tyler wowed the audience by censuring the Unabomber while drinking a glass of water. As Tyler drank, Lester appeared to speak without difficulty, saying, 'These heartless acts of terror perpetrated upon America have put a permanent black mark on our history as a nation.' Attorneys for Kaczynski reacted strongly to the condemnation. Said defense lawyer Albert Winnman: 'My client has already been tried and convicted by the American media establishment. He cannot get a fair trial. A public condemnation from Willie Tyler and Lester only makes things that much worse.' Willie Tyler and Lester plan to take their condemnation of the Unabomber on the road. They will headline at Shecky's Joke Barn in Omaha, NE, on Friday, May 10, and Saturday, May 11. And they will appear at The Wacky Works Comedy Showcase in Des Moines, IA, Thursday, May 16, through Sunday, May 19. The Unabomber trial date has not yet been set.","entertainment, archive, news, vol 29 issue 17, entertainment"

4069,Umabomber Captured,"FBI Ends 18-Year Search for Leggy Luddite Lolita In a spectacular climax to the longest manhunt ever mounted by the FBI, federal agents captured the notorious, glamorous Umabomber yesterday. The radical terrorist and darling of the silver screen is the chief suspect in 16 bombings, 23 injuries and three deaths, as well as audience-wowing appearances in the racy Dangerous Liaisons and the smash hit Pulp Fiction, over the last 18 years. FBI investigators spent a reported $68 million and over 300,000 work hours in their effort to nab the elusive beauty, and as the starlet flashed her million-dollar smile at paparazzi while being led into custody last week, one question arose: Who can blame them? The star-studded arrest was witnessed by over two million viewers on Pay-Per-View and featured law enforcement officials from seven states as well as celebrity guests Brad Pitt and Bruce Willis. 'The Umabomber's been on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List for 18 years,' Variety columnist Bunny Shirer said, 'and on People magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People in the World list for the last five. That means two things: Boffo Box Office, and Blammo Post Office.' She later added that MCA/ Universal had been pursuing the Umabomber for years, and that the FBI is very lucky to have her. 'The Umabomber is a ruthless, highly educated extremist with no respect for human life, and whose looks and talent have made her an extremely sought-after property, both in Hollywood and by national law enforcement,' said the Umabomber's Pulp Fiction co-star Bruce Willis at an exclusive after-arrest party at L.A.'s Viper Room. The Umabomber, who has lived a life of luxury for years, shielded from media scrutiny by security cameras and bodyguards, was almost impossible to reach, according to FBI spokespersons. 'We must have called her publicist six, seven times a week,' said Tom Bannon of the joint Federal Bureau of Investigation/Screen Actors' Guild team in charge of tracking the elusive Umabomber throughout her grisly and glamorous career. 'Always, it was the same thing: 'Uma's not available this week, we'll get back to you.'' Police left messages on her voice mail, staked out her manager's office, and sent her scripts, all to no avail. 'We're very excited to finally get the Umabomber for the FBI,' said an FBI official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 'Now that we've stolen her away from her three-picture deal at Paramount, we can expect higher FBI box-office grosses than ever before.' After a number of false leads (such as a rumor that 1992's Final Analysis would be shot on location in Tunisia, causing an expensive and fruitless mobilization of Interpol), FBI detectives got their first real break a year later, when the Umabomber's bodyguard, Flavio, allegedly punched an FBI photographer who was trying to get inside her limousine. The Umabomber remained strangely inactive following her starring role in the flop Even Cowgirls Get the Blues, prompting hopeful speculation that her deadly spree may have permanently ended. She returned to the spotlight last year however, with the horrific letter-bombing of timber lobbyist Murray Bilgert, and numerous supporting roles that showed her increasing versatility as an actress. Experts agree that the Umabomber's fatal slip-up occurred in 1995, when the star's publicist convinced the New York Times and Washington Post to print a 35,000-word manifesto against technology alongside a full-page ad for her Oscar-nominated release, Pulp Fiction. But it was the media campaign for the upcoming release of the irreverent romantic comedy The Truth About Cats and Dogs, co-starring funnywoman Janeane Garofalo, that made the Umabomber's cap-ture all the more urgent, ac-cor-ding to sources close to the case. 'If that film is a hit, you can erase any doubts about the Umabomber's staying power as a celebrity,' said FBI spokesman Tom Haver. According to The Uma-bomb-er's personal assistant, Denise Mazur, despite persistent rumors that she is involved with Johnny Depp, she is single and looking forward to prison life. 'After all that terrorist bombing and 19-hour days on the set,' Mazur says, 'the Umabomber is looking forward to being a regular prisoner again.'","entertainment, archive, news, vol 29 issue 14, entertainment"

4074,Nine Drawn and Quartered at Renaissance Fair,"RICHMOND, VA'Nine people were torn limb-from-limb and skewered through the anus with wooden stakes this weekend at the city's annual Renaissance Fair. Organizers boast that the 'Drawn and Quartered' show made this year's fair one of the most authentic ever. The early-Renaissance torture demonstration was one of many improvisations that peppered the fair ground, performed by actors from the local theatre community dressed in period costumes. These performances have been a fixture of past years' fairs. 'The skits where we publicly tortured and humiliated 'condemned heretics' gave us by far the most response we've ever gotten,' actor Paul Mealen said. 'Who would have thought that violence would appeal to people?' In the skit, victims were randomly selected from the crowd, strung up on posts, and read official 'charges.' A dirt-encrusted dagger was then used to saw off vital parts of the condemned. One man's scrotum was cut off, causing his testicles to fall to the ground. According to witnesses, children at the festival then tossed the testicles back and forth as the victim watched. Vital organs such as the liver were cut out of further victims, then cooked and force-fed to them. The pale and barely conscious victims were then taken down from the posts and prepared for the next stage of their torture amid taunts and bellows from the crowd. 'We loved it,' said Both University of Virginia student Steve Limeneg, who, along with his friend Alicia Ponfret, was attending the fair for the first time. 'It was like we were transported back to the real Renaissance. We got turkey drumsticks at the Ye Olde Grille, threw stones at the Drench a Wench booth'I won a stuffed jester doll'then we got to see this heretic forced to eat his own kidney.' Added Richmond middle-school teacher Linda Rougfas: 'It was a lot of fun. They picked my husband out of the crowd and he thought it was a kick. When they eviscerated him and he started screaming and begging for his life and crying out to me, the kids and I did our part, yelling 'heretic!' and so on.' Next, four horses were tied to the arms and legs of each victim, and each horse was made to pull in opposing directions, summarily causing limbs to tear off and go skipping in every direction. Finally, the disembodied and helpless torsos were fed to packs of ravenous dogs. The victims' horrific, wheezing screams caught the attention of the entire fair. 'I thought it was very impressive,' said Her-man Kline-mest, an executive at a nearby bank who partook of the fair with his wife and three children. 'I en-joyed taunting the condemned, and my children enjoyed playing with the testicles.' One volunteer was tied up and laid on his back spread-eagled, his legs held apart by a short beam roped to a horse. A long wooden stake was braced against a rock and inserted just a few inches into the participant's anus. When the horse was given a snap from the whip, it bolted, causing the participant to be driven onto the stake until it thrust out of his mouth. Festival organizer Liz Fendamn has been under pressure to compete with nearby Colonial Williamsburg for tourist dollars, and she said the event was popular enough to guarantee a return next year. 'We try to give people a merry ol' time, m'Lord,' she said with a smile. 'Ye can bet yer knickers we'll be doing it again.' She hinted they may even have the performing troupe dress like Spanish soldiers and wantonly slaughter masses of heretical fair visitors. Though most everyone thought the fair was the most successful ever, several family members of the killed were not so enthusiastic. 'My husband and I came to the fair as part of our honeymoon,' Jacklyn Welden said. 'When he was stabbed through the heart and killed for blaspheming the Pope, the fair suddenly became less fun.' Welden added that she will not be returning next year.","entertainment, archive, archive, vol 28 issue 18, entertainment"
4075,Congress Hires Drummer,"WASHINGTON, D.C.'In a decisive 376-45 vote last Friday, the United States Congress hired drummer Joey Lombardo, a professional percussionist with years of studio and touring experience. Lombardo, who has toured with such diverse artists as Kenny Loggins, Pat Benatar and Richard Marx, is expected to provide the legislative body with a variety of much-needed percussive effects. 'You wouldn't believe how much his steady backbeat helps keep bills and budget proposals rolling along, not to mention adding some zip to those filibusters,' Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (R-NY) said. 'Lombardo provides a rock-solid foundation upon which Congress can really jam.' The seasoned studio vet, who played with Bryan Adams on the Australian leg of the star's 1991 Waking Up the Neighbors Tour, will also provide drum rolls during key budget votes. Before the vote tally for the controversial Steffens-Hawley Welfare Bill was announced Monday, Lombardo performed a dramatic, prolonged snare drum roll, which, according to 93'year-old Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-SC), 'made me tingly.' Despite his lack of Congressional drumming experience, Lombardo is confident he has the stamina to keep up with the long-winded legislators. 'When I was on Tina Turner's Break Every Rule World Tour, we did a show in Rio that was over three and half hours. I'm confident that if I can keep up with Tina, I can keep up with Orrin Hatch and Arlen Specter.' With his extensive experience playing live, Lombardo also brings a theatrical sensibility to Congress. When Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich recently opened session with the remark, 'I know why Clinton didn't want to play cards with me on Air Force One'he was afraid of losing all of his money!,' Lombardo was on hand with a rimshot and cymbal crash to drive home the humor. Lombardo's drumset, a Starclassic eight-piece kit with glitter finish and a half-dozen Zildjian cymbals, has been permanently placed where Vice President Al Gore used to sit. The top-flight set, which was profiled in the April '91 issue of Modern Drummer, has already caught the eye of a number of lawmakers. 'Boy, I'd love to get behind those skins,' Sen. Jesse Helms (R-NC) said. Helms went on to say that if Lombardo could teach him his one-handed drumstick-twirling technique, that would be 'very cool.' Other voices in Congress are also excited by Lombardo's presence. 'The beat of the drum calls out to all peoples,' Rep. Pat Schroeder (D-CO) said. 'Lombardo's rhythms will represent the heartbeat of our great nation.' Schroeder added that in his sleeveless red mesh T-shirt and tight jeans, the sinewy Lombardo is 'much easier on the eyes than Patrick Moynihan.' Other instruments were proposed to accompany Congress, including a bass guitar, a pipe organ and a synthesizer, but it was ultimately Lombardo's power drumming that won out. The two-time Drum World Drummer of the Month was eager to talk about his new job. 'I've had a lot of tough gigs in the past, but this one tops it,' Lombardo said. 'I'll be keeping the beat for the finest product of the Enlightenment, set in motion by our forefathers, swinging with enough finesse'yet also true crushing power'in rhythm to this intricate machine of Jeffersonian thought.' Lighting a cigarette, he added, 'I hope my chops are up to it.' A number of special musical guests have already been booked to sit in with Lombardo during lon-ger Congressional sessions. Among the artists: Tito Puente and his Latin Orchestra, Al Jarreau, and three-time Grammy-nominated saxophonist David San-born. President Clinton offered his congratulations for the Lombardo hiring in a press release this morning. 'After months of attempts to erode the American Dream with cruel budget cuts, it is heartening to see such a positive decision coming out of Congress,' Clinton said. 'Ever since I caught Lombardo behind the set on The Hooters' Nervous Night Tour, I've known him as an American who can really rock.'","entertainment, archive, archive, vol 28 issue 17, entertainment"
